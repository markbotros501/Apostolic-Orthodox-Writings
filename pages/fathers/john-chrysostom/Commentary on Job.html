    <h1>St John Chrysostom on Job</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">That the book is useful to all, in every aspect of lives and circumstances, for man and woman, elder and young, commoner and ruler, rich and poor, to those prospering and flourishing, and to those pressed by difficulties, can be easily demonstrated. For this marvelous and great man, who is celebrated everywhere in the world, the champion and crown-bearer of piety, who passed through all trials, and who established countless trophies against the devil, he became both rich and poor, esteemed and despised, with many children and childless, in royal courts and on a dung heap, in splendid attire, and after that in a source of worms; he enjoyed countless ministrations, and after these endured countless insults, from servants rising up, friends reproaching, and a wife plotting against him. Everything flowed to him as if from springs—abundance of wealth, greatness of might, prominence of glory, security of peace, honor, and service, and health of body, and good order of children. Nothing was troublesome; there was wealth with security, and untroubled prosperity. And rightly so; for God had fortified him on every side. But later, all those things fled away, and countless storms encamped in that man’s house, all in succession and continuous, all with overwhelming force; for everything he had was suddenly seized, and the children were buried by untimely and violent death, slain at the table and feast, not by sword or knife, but by an evil spirit having seized the house. And the wife, thereafter armed, brought engines of war against the just one; and friends and servants, some spat in his face, others attacked him, and he was cast out of every house, and his dwelling was the dung heap, and from every side it teemed with worms, and his body overflowed with blood and pus, and taking a shard, he drained the pus, becoming his own executioner. And pains successive and unbearable, and night was harder than day, and day more burdensome than night, and all were precipices and cliffs; and there was no one consoling him, but countless persecuting him. Nevertheless, in such a storm, and amid such ineffable waves, he stood nobly and unwaveringly. The reason was that he considered well the nature of things, and knowing their changeability, foresaw the future, and acting rightly, he did not despair in despondency; therefore, even in prosperity, he maintained moderation. Not only for patience and endurance, but also as an example of other virtues does this long-suffering man stand for those who pay attention: of bravery and perseverance in trials; of not behaving arrogantly, but being gentle, moderate, and engaging with cheerfulness in wealth and power; of temperance in pleasures; and of justice in judgments and dealings. And above all, of concord, and the chief of virtues, love; for he accomplished every virtue with appropriate precision. Taking up this image as an outline, impress it on your conscience; and if you are in despondency, take refuge in it; and if in wealth, receive from here the remedy, so as not to be dipped by poverty, nor puffed up by wealth; and if you lose children, here you have the consolation, for you will find here the excess of both misfortunes and endurance; and if you fall into sickness, recall the sources of worms, and will bear everything gently; and if a friend plots against you, again bring forth the saint to the midst.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Bring forth the saint to the midst, and you will be delivered from suffering; even if those who meet him may not suffice, consider what things he suffered from his servants, and you will receive great healing. If someone envelops you in malign suspicion, reckon the things that were said about him, that he has not yet paid a worthy penalty for the sins, and the reproaches given, and you will be delivered from this suffering. For there is no misfortune among men that he did not endure, more steadfast than any diamond, having borne hunger, poverty, disease, loss of children, and the loss of so many possessions all at once; and after that, plotted against by a woman, insulted by friends, betrayed by servants, through all he was shown to be stronger than any rock. And these things were before the law and grace. For we will not have the usual excuse, when those who, after law and grace, receiving such a gift, endure less than him, who in the beginning and introductory moments of the life of men displayed such philosophy.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"A certain man was in the land of Ausitis, whose name was Job."</i><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What does the preface want, and for what reason did the author thus begin? He was about to narrate a virtuous life, and one greatly surpassing our condition. So that no one, looking upon the excess of struggles and endurance, might think it to be some foreign nature and not human, he first reveals the nature, so that you might marvel at the purpose; that he was a man by nature, one of the many, yet superior to many in virtue. He spoke of the commonality of nature to show the distinctness of the intent; that having shared in the same nature with all, he conducted his life beyond nature, and greater than according to man. He proclaims him also from the region, so that from there also you might marvel at what kind of rose bloomed from a thorn. Behold first the praise, that such a shoot the land of Ausitis bore. For in Arabia for there to be such a reputable one, where all were corrupted, where there was no exemplar of good order, this was wondrous.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And that man was true, blameless, righteous, God-fearing, abstaining from every evil thing."</i><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">The external wise men, defining man, say: Man is a rational mortal being. However, divine Scripture defines as a man the one who has preserved the image and is known through virtue. But it does not even wish to call a man the one who confuses and destroys the godlike forms and characters. For if someone possesses the character of nature but violates it with the wickedness of choice, he hears from the Prophet: Man, being in honor, did not understand; he was compared to the senseless beasts and became like them. Therefore, the Scripture, using its customary habit and showing that nothing so characterizes man as blamelessness, justice, and piety, hence declares Job to be recognized and says that he was a true man. For the wicked are false men, like those painted. And these things the Ecclesiast also, summarizing all commandments in the fear of God, says: The end of the word, hear everything; fear God and keep His commandments, for this is every man. And another prophesying in Jerusalem, since he saw no one heeding, says: I came, and there was no man; I called, and there was no one listening. And we also, according to common practice, when we send a servant or a son for some action, are accustomed to say to him, as a man to undertake the action, that is, the human condition.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Maintain your position as prudent, as possessing reason, thus think, thus act, show by your activity that you truly are a human. For one is recognized not by form but by action; otherwise, what is said is said merely by name. Indeed the only true man is the one who preserves the image, who does not hide the god-given beauty, like Job, genuine, not counterfeit, demonstrating the virtue of a man by actions, not pretending in form or theatrically simulating it. As God previously required of Abraham, saying: "Walk before me and be blameless;" so now Scripture testifies of Job: For saying that he was true, it added that he was also blameless. And examine the word for me, to understand the great precision of the righteous: why did it not say unaccused but blameless? Because accusation is set upon the gravest sins, while blame is on the small and the least; not only, it says, was he free from the greatest evils, but even slightly entangled in the lightest ones, which are more blame than accusation, bring only censure, not punishment. Aquila, indeed, and Symmachus, instead of blameless, one rendered simple, the other irreproachable; one implying the honest and unpretentious nature of the righteous, the other signifying the virtue trained to precision. For irreproachable is he who lacks none of the good things, who lives his life without stumbling from any wickedness; then after blameless he adds that he is also righteous, and righteousness is the collection and union of all good and noble things. For if something that appears praiseworthy happens in some respect apart from the rest of virtue, it is incomplete and useless, rather even often contrary and blameworthy. Just like if someone is intelligent and perceptive, if he does not plan justly, he is treacherous and wicked-minded, not wise. Concerning such it is said, "They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have not known;" again, another is brave towards contests and dangers; if he does not desire to act justly, he is savage and violent, like those who say: "Let strength be the law of justice for us;" for weakness is proven to be useless. Those who control bodily pleasures but are not temperate, greedy, money-loving, profligate, not generous, extravagantly spend for desire of gain. In general, every part of justice, cut off from the rest like a body, is nothing; but the harmony and assembly of all the admirable things can reasonably be deemed justice; if something wondrous is lacking, it is limping in this and maimed, and the name of justice is false. For the just man is first necessarily wise; how could he act appropriately and apply himself fittingly to all unless he understands the order and power of each? Then he is temperate, for intemperance is injustice; god-loving, for the pious, it is said, plan just things; meek, humane, beneficent; and altogether the harmony of all deeds according to right reason completes the just man; and precisely Ezekiel taught us this, through whom God says, "But the man who shall be just, doing justice." Then he delineates the just man by composing complete and whole virtue from its parts; and first attaches piety to him, saying: "He shall not eat of the mountains," for in the mountains they performed idolatry. Then he says that temperance should be added to him: "And he will not defile his neighbor's wife, nor approach a woman in her impurity." Then he also attributes to him meekness and equitableness, "And he shall not oppress any man;" he reveals his just behavior by saying, "And he shall not seize any spoils;" he depicts him as merciful and social, saying, "He shall give his bread to the hungry, and cloak the naked, he shall not give his silver for interest, and he will take no excess.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">He also reveals a conciliatory and peaceful nature, as one able to give excellent judgment to those who dispute. For, it is said, "He will turn away his hand from injustice and make righteous judgment between a man and his neighbor." For this exceptional and most eminent characteristic, which is composed of all the achievements of justice, is the civil and judicial disposition, providing what is fitting to each, and is therefore named after justice. Having gone through all the things to be done and not to be done, he applied the common rule and pattern to all, which one, by observing, will err in nothing. "He walked," it is said, "in my commandments, and observed my statutes to do them." And all these things, being bound and mixed together, and held like a harmonious and unified body, make a man righteous. Having perfected him through so many things and having set, as it were, a boundary and outline from all these things, he enclosed all in a single name, and says: "This righteous one shall live by life." Since we have heard what characterizes the righteous one, let us consider these things alongside those according to Job. The righteous is devout, and what about Job? Did he not appease God with sacrifices at every occasion? He is temperate, and of him, it is said, "I made a covenant with my eyes not to regard a virgin." He is gentle and meek, and who is gentler than he? Even his servants were so hanging upon him for his extreme goodness, that they desired slightly to even swallow him, saying: "Who would give us the flesh of his to be satisfied?" He is merciful and sociable, and who is equal to Job in this? Was not his door open to every comer, and did anyone depart with an empty bosom? The righteous justly arbitrates to those who dispute; here too Job can boast and say: "I investigated a case I did not know and shattered the jaws of the wicked." The righteous will harm no one, and Job even calls down curses upon himself, "If I raised my hand against the orphan, let my shoulder be separated from its collarbone." Since Job has exceeded in every part of virtue, he is therefore called blameless and righteous. Thus, Job too was righteous, not having a part of virtue in himself, but all human virtue wholly and comprehensively; not refraining from one evil while clinging to another. In the same way, we call that weight just which is equal everywhere, not if it can make gold of equal balance but sets lead oppositely; rather that which provides equality in all materials and a measure that is everywhere equal. So too, Job was everywhere equal; not only did he maintain this equality in matters of wealth but also in all other things, exceeding the measure nowhere. Nor could anyone say that he cherished equality in wealth while exceeding the measure in his dealings with neighbors, but living and being noble he avoided this even from great abundance, saying: "If I despised the cause of my servant or maid when they contended with me, or was not I born as they were?" Then this too is the greatest injustice, to be arrogant and boastful. For just as we call one desiring to take the possessions of others and not satisfied with his own a greedy man, so we also call one who demands more than what is due to a man from his neighbor boastful, whenever someone sets himself in every honor and wishes to dishonor another; and this arises from injustice. For that is injustice, as God made one essence for all, giving all things common and equal toward the neighbor. How then do you cast him out and deprive him of the honor given by God? Not allowing him to share, but making everything yours, not in wealth but making him poor in glory. God granted one essence to both and the preeminence of existence, for "Let us make man" is common to all the race; how then do you remove him from his paternal honor?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">You cast out substance, leading to extreme poverty, and making what is common into what is private? But the blessed Job was not such, for he also said: I did not despise the judgment of a servant or a maidservant; therefore the writer presenting him as just says, not having the partial justice in transactions and lawsuits, but possessing universal virtue, according to that about which it is written, Against the righteous, no law is set. He also adds that he was god-fearing, to show that he was perfect both toward men and toward God; for righteousness is towards men, and godliness towards God. Observe that virtues follow one another and combine with each other; for a good life makes one know God, and the knowledge of God becomes a guardian of life. Hence Job, being righteous, was therefore also god-fearing; and since he always had God before his eyes, he pursued justice rightly for its own sake, and not for any other reason; there is no becoming righteous without first being blameless. For these reasons, the true man leads, not one who wears a façade and the outer appearance of reverence, but one who truly and genuinely pursues virtue and is shaped by it; following such a person is the blameless one; for the genuine worker of virtue also guards himself against the seemingly small things. To him follows the one named just in a derivative sense from perfect righteousness, fully equipped with every form of virtue; then after these, the god-fearing one enters more luminously, excelling in both good deeds and correct doctrines. To these is added the phrase, abstaining from every wicked thing, which leaves no room for exception, for it is not said he abstained from this evil but not that, or mastered many but was overcome by few, but he did not wish to touch any wickedness. Yet, mere abstinence from evil is not sufficient, but there must also be the practice of good deeds; for the idleness of virtue can also lead to punishment, not just the practice of wickedness. After all, those who did not feed the hungry, because they did not practice charity, are therefore handed over to eternal punishment. Hence, we learn that abstaining from evil is not the beginning of our salvation unless the acquisition of good and the practice of virtue are also present. Consider how briefly the law of the divine Spirit summarized the praise of the man, saying truly that Job was genuine in creation, as if listing this as his homeland and ancestors, blameless in action, just in good orders and in his association with beings, and still, in delivering correct judgments on matters judged, and besides all, god-fearing in faith, hating idols, abstaining from every wicked thing according to his fervent hatred of wickedness. And to sum up, it says, he never did anything worthy of blame, but kept justice toward men and approached religion purely, doing everything according to God and genuinely piously worshiping the Divine.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"There were born to him seven sons and three daughters."</i><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">First, he mentioned virtue, and then those things given by God. For from virtue, long ago, these came into being, good offspring, I mean, and many children; for it is said, "There shall not be in you anyone barren, nor any sterile upon your land." But Abraham for this reason was childless, that you may learn that these are not truly the rewards of virtue, but others; and for this reason, he promised these things, condescending. We conclude then, that marriage is no impediment to virtue; for otherwise it would have been a hindrance to Job. Yet indeed, this bond did not prevent the righteous one from running rightly, so in vain do some make this pretext.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And his livestock were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred pairs of oxen, five hundred female donkeys that roamed, and a very great many servants, and he had great works on the earth."</i><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Behold, then, the wealth.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Having the more rustic; for it is not enumerated loans and interests, nor gold-roofed houses; from which nothing was lacking to be able to do good; but sheep, and oxen, and the things from seasons and agriculture, from which he helped those in need. For, as I said, he was not boasting from precious material, but content with what was measured according to the need, this king the Scripture presents to us. It does not mention horses, or chariots gilded with gold, or treasures of silver and gold, and precious stones, and other things igniting the disease of love of wealth, but those that least exceed necessity. For having children, he remained unscathed by possessions, considering wealth and abundance, the deficiency of desire, and noble ambition, not being enslaved to passions. Since it is obelized, the phrase, “and a great abundance of service,” it is necessary to know, that whatever is obelized is not found in the Hebrew, but was added only by the Seventy for clarity. To ascribe a spiritual vision in the recording of animals in different kinds, at the same time is a dream interpretation and excessive.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And that man was noble, from those of the sunrising."</i><sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">However, Symmachus, greatest of all the Easterners, has published. He says he was the most illustrious and distinguished of all, and he had ancestors to count as notable and illustrious, but none of these things lifted him into arrogance.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And his sons, traveling together with one another, made a banquet each day, also taking along their three sisters to eat and drink with them."</i><sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Having harmony in virtue, they were also unwavering among the tangible things, proceeding towards one another, and not far, nor making associations with others. They also included their sisters as witnesses of their temperance; for they did not invite strangers to their loving gatherings and meals, but their sisters accompanied them, which was a clear sign of modesty and decorum. But the devil discovered their concord and companionship, for the collective plot against them, to cast them all down together in the house of the elder brother.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And when the days of the feast had been completed, Job sent and purified them, rising early in the morning."</i><sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">You see a purification not Mosaic, but apostolic, cleansing their mind, but not the body, with prayers. And some say that even the priests of old were, like Melchizedek, unordained. This therefore signifies the phrase, "He sent."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And it came to pass on this day, and behold, the angels of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and the devil came with them."</i><sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">God is invisible to all created nature, without dimension, without size, present everywhere, and presiding over all, encompassing all things, and there is no place outside His dominion. He is present to each, as is fitting; to the holy angels, as holy, sending ineffable voices of commands, but to the evil one, as evil, He permits trials upon men; for the devil is not able to do anything except what is permitted by God. He does not stand in the heavenly places, may it not be; for from there he was cast down. For how, it is said, did the morning star, who rises early, fall from heaven? Yet he is said to appear among the angels, as also he exists in the places of God's dominion, awaiting permission or allowance to bring forth temptations upon men; not fulfilling any service to God, but because he was cast down because of his transgression and wickedness, and he remains against us. He is permitted by the one who governs our affairs well to bring temptations upon us, which we are able to bear; thus the Scripture, having made these things explicit for our understanding, advances the word as a figure. The phrase, "It came to pass as this day," instead of "a day came in which the arena was opened, and the athlete descended towards the struggles."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Towards the struggles. Since the holy angels care for us and watch over us; but the devil opposes our salvation, and concerning the same matter, that is, the human being, they contend with one another; they are said to stand together, while God looks upon the deeds. We prevail or are defeated, not because of the strength of those who oppose or the weakness of those who assist, but because of our own will. For as each exhorts to their own part, the holy angels to the good things, and the wicked demons to the evil things, our choice, being honored with free will, proceeds to whatever side it wishes. For neither does God coerce, having honored us with free will, nor does the devil possess any coercive power against us, but according to choice we either succeed or fail, inclining towards angels or demons.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And the Lord said to the devil, From where have you come?"</i><sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What then, with the angelic ministry, is the devil present, and in the midst of the holy spirits, does the unclean one speak freely? Neither the angels were present to God bodily, nor Satan; but every ministry is called presence. As a creation of God, the devil is also commanded to perform duties; for even if he has rebelled in intention, yet he lies under the yoke of servitude, and is commanded to execute the orders as an executioner. And just as our rulers, when they call someone with honor, send honorable men, but when they drag someone with dishonor, they send certain harsh soldiers; so also God sends ministering angels to the saints for salvation, but when He wills to punish, He allows wicked forces. Hence also Paul delivers the transgressor in Corinth to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, and others again, so that they may not blaspheme.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And the devil answered the Lord and said: Having gone around the earth and walked about under the heaven, I am present."</i><sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Through the method of question and answer, the Scripture advanced the discourse and outlined the truth more clearly, thereby removing every excuse of the shameless. For what it says about the devil speaking to God, it did not say he merely thought, but openly declared; for such audacity was not removed from him. By saying that he roams everywhere, he first becomes his own accuser, as he no longer holds firm his position but is tossed everywhere, having undertaken the conflict against all mankind. Next, we learn that the world is filled with both demons and angels, and that both are under the authority of God, and that angels indeed appear before God receiving commands; but the devil can do nothing according to his own pleasure unless he receives permission from above. For even if he rebels and is outside of serving God, yet still the fear acts as a bridle, and he is not allowed to exercise his own power. But observe, those appear as servants, reporting what is done; he has nothing to say. The heavens, therefore, are inaccessible to this wicked demon, and he is not present everywhere at the same time, but moves in a circuit. Under heaven, he says, to denote also the wilderness, and whatever lies under heaven, and the atmospheric place; he roams even the uninhabited, perhaps by a certain providence of God, so that he might not continuously trouble our kind.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And the Lord said to him, "Have you considered in your mind my servant Job?""</i><sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">From this we learn that God wanted Job to be tested, as if he had a noble athlete. For this reason, He asks the devil, so that he might give him the occasion for the contest; yet, He did not wish to provide the occasion Himself, lest He seem to be seeking honor. But observe how in small measures the manner of the dialogue is refuted; for no longer does it show him making a declaration of words, but instead, "Have you considered in your mind?"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The narrative has given forth a voice. Therefore God allowed the devil to be perceived even without a voice, knowing that his wicked plan and act did not escape His notice, and as if He is speaking to him, He says, "From where have you come?" not wishing to learn the devil's habit (for how could He, who possesses knowledge of all things, not know?), but as is often His custom, He presents things in the form of a question. Just as in the Gospels, concerning Cleopas, the Lord brings forth inquiries, saying, "What are these words that you exchange with one another?" And who would dare to say that He who has fashioned alone our hearts needs to ask a question? Such is also the inquiry, "How many loaves do you have?" and elsewhere, when confirming His resurrection, He said, "Do you have any food here?" And concerning Lazarus, He inquired, "Where have you laid him?" though He anticipated the news and foretold his end. In the same manner here, speaking to the devil, "From where have you come?" and, "Have you considered my servant?" He utters words not from ignorance, nor does He wish to be taught about the way of the malicious one, but He uses him himself as a witness of his own cruelty. For wickedness itself by nature is prone to harm itself.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"A man blameless, truthful, god-fearing, refraining from every evil thing."</i><sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What harm do people incur by despising others and the entire world, when the Lord of angels praises and proclaims? Just as, if He does not bless, even if all who dwell on the earth and sea praise, it is of no benefit. Therefore, let us everywhere aim for this, that He Himself may proclaim us; if this is the case, we are higher than all, even in poverty, in sickness, or in visible evils. For even the blessed Job, sitting in ashes, surrounded by the discharge of wounds, teeming with myriad springs of worms, suffering those incurable things, being spat upon by servants, plotted against by friends, by foes, by his wife, brought to poverty, to hunger, to that incurable sickness, was more blessed than all. How? Because God was blessing him, saying, "A righteous man, blameless, true, devout." For how was he not exceeding all those upon the earth, when God, the witness of all, testified to him, saying, "Blameless, a true man," possessing some incomparable virtue, observing just things towards men blamelessly, pursuing the piety towards God precisely? And the devil, looking upon his state, had no small wonder concerning him. Why does he at this point change the order of praise? Perhaps he does this indifferently, or perhaps he arranges the praise according to the nature of things and harmony. For first, every man is true, according to the reason of creation; then blameless, according to the manner of life; here, due to the fight against the devil, he places the blameless before the true. Virtue knows how to fight against vice, and the justice of character becomes the sharpest arrow against the envious. Then he attaches the true to the blameless, to show nature agreeing with character, and free will adorning the nobility of nature.</p>

you have made many upon the earth."</i><sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">You see the wealth given by God, you see that it is not from injustice; For you, he says, have fenced, you have blessed, you have made his possessions many. How much did Job have to toil to persuade people that the wealth was not from injustice? Behold, the devil testified to this on his behalf, even if he did not know it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Indeed, he will bless you upon your face."</i><sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup></span></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And it was like this day."</i><sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup></span></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And behold, an angel came to Job and said to him."</i><sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Murder is mingled with destruction, which makes the enemies appear burdensome; great is the savagery, and the inhumanity, the calamity is double, murder, and captivity; and the salvation of the one remaining is an addition of evils. Did you see how swift the blow, how novel and strange the misfortune; he who had such abundance and never experienced anything of the sort suddenly found himself in deprivation of all possessions; for, not some things were taken away and others left behind for some consolation of the lost, but they themselves are left alone, recounting the tragedy.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said to Job, "Fire fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and consumed the shepherds likewise, and I alone escaped to tell you.""</i><sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">The wicked one regretted because he originally reported wrongly. "I shot poorly," he said, "I did not hit the target, the unerring arrow strayed." I said that people captured the oxen and the donkeys; Job might reason, "People wronged me, what does this have to do with God? Should I attribute the wrongdoing of people to God? Others are the wrongdoers, and another will be the one blasphemed?" So, to redirect his mind from people to God, he says: "Fire fell from heaven." Aquila and Theodotion said: "Fire of God." You cannot say that "Enemies threw it down from above, insult the wrongdoers, blaspheme against the assailant; why do you serve him? Why do you worship the one destroying your possessions?" Do not think the blows are human when you hear them taking prisoners; from above, God wages war against you, from heaven. And it is clear, as even the fire coming down from heaven consumed the sheep. See how great the power of the devil is, how he stirred up so many nations, either by forming demons into enemies—understand for me the ease—do not truly think it is fire (for he cannot create), but thus he displayed consuming all. Or if it were truly fire, he moved this too from what exists, with God allowing it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"While this one was still speaking, another messenger arrives, saying to Job: As your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking at their elder brother's house, suddenly a great wind came from the desert and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon your children, and they have perished; I alone have escaped, and I have come to announce it to you."</i><sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">He works a calamity more grievous. However, the phrase "I alone was saved," in the case of others, had some sort of reason, but here it intensifies the suffering, since, with the children having perished, this one alone was saved, who brings the message. Therefore, it seems to me that the devil himself is the one announcing these things, himself the author of the evils, coming in many forms, and craftily making the announcements. Because of this, he continually visits, converses wickedly, and places the more grievous dangers last, in order that by undermining with lesser threats the strength of the soul, he may prepare the soul for the unbearable assault of greater ones. And that the one bringing the announcements was not from the servants is clear from there: how then could the household, seized on all four corners, save the one? How also, in each calamity, is there one, and he alone, found to be superior to the dangers, as if reserved for this purpose? But it was he who both acted and announced the hardships. For there is no other found more bitter; therefore, he entrusted the ministry of these wicked dramas to no other. The wise one varies the blows of his evil, contemplating nothing in moderation, so that in this way he may shake the strongholds of the soul with successive attacks; and just like someone bringing siege engines against walls, he deceives the one being attacked, stealing safety through manifold schemes. Thus, the envious one, in some order amid disorder and impiety, brought dangers to the tower of piety.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Thus, having heard, Job rose and tore his garments, and shaved the hair of his head."</i><sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">If then he tore his garments and shaved his head, do not be amazed; for he was a father, and a tender father; and it was necessary to show both the sympathy of nature and the wisdom of purpose. For if he did not do this, perhaps someone might have thought that this philosophy was insensibility. Therefore, he shows both the emotions and the precision of his philosophy, and despite suffering, he did not falter. Do not think the matter to be a defeat; this most of all shows the victory; for if he did not do this, someone might have said that God made him insensible to sufferings. But now it shows that even while suffering, he philosophizes; indeed, he built his soul upon the rock of himself. The rain descended, for he says fire fell from heaven and devoured all the flocks; the rivers came, the frequent and continuous messages of misfortunes, one speaking of the shepherds, another of the camels, and another of the children's loss; the winds blew, the bitter words of the wife; for she says, speak a word against the Lord and die. And the house did not fall, the soul was not tripped up, the righteous did not blaspheme, but even gave thanks, even though it was the devil warring against him, the wicked one, the savage one, the one never reconciled to human nature, but waging relentless war and declaring unending strife against our race; and he was not simply angered, but stirred up all devices and brought every enchantment. Yet not even so did he shame the courage of the righteous, but the noble man laughed at his arrows, and bore that unbearable war nobly; and this, not in grace, but before the Old Covenant, and before grace; and he showed that it is not the nature of the trials, but the negligence of the slothful that tends to cause the fall; as even the strong, affliction makes stronger. For affliction, he says, produces endurance. And just as the force of winds assaulting and fanning strong trees from all sides does not uproot them, but even strengthens them through such assaults; so too the firm soul, living with caution, the inducements of afflictions do not undermine, but anoint it for greater endurance, and cannot harm a man's virtue. And what is the virtue of man? Not riches, so that you might fear poverty; nor health of body, so that you might fear sickness, nor the opinion of the many, so that you might dread an evil reputation, nor life simply and without purpose, so that death might become dreadful to you, nor freedom, so that you might flee slavery. But the precision of true doctrines, and the righteousness in life. These not even the devil himself will be able to strip away, if the one possessing them preserves them with the requisite precision; and even that most evil and savage demon knows this. For indeed, on account of this, he also plundered the substance of Job, not to make him poor, but to compel him to utter some blasphemous word, and inflicted wounds on his body, not to cast illness upon him, but to overthrow the virtue of his soul. But nevertheless, having overcome all his machinations, and having made him poor instead of wealthy, this which seems to be most terrible to all of us, childless instead of having many children, and having flayed his entire body more severely than executioners in courts do (for not as deeply do their nails pierce the sides of those who fall into their hands, as the mouths of worms did gnaw his flesh), and having cast upon him an evil reputation (for his friends who were present said to him, "You are not punished according to what you have sinned," and many brought against him accusatory charges); and not only did he exile him from the city, nor merely from his home, and place him in another city, but by making a dung heap both his home and city, he not only caused him no harm, but even through what he contrived, he revealed him to be more glorious. Not only did he not take away any of his possessions, although taking away so many, but he also increased for him the wealth of virtue; for he also enjoyed greater freedom of speech afterwards, having fought a much harder battle. If, having suffered so much, he was not wronged at all, and having suffered not from a man, but from the most wicked of all demons; who will any longer have an excuse, saying, "Someone wronged and harmed me"? For if the devil, full of such malignity, having deployed all his instruments and unleashed all his arrows, and all evils there are among men, with great excess into the house and body of the just one, wronged him not at all, but, as I said, even greatly benefited him; how will certain people be able to accuse someone, asserting that they were wronged by them, and not asserting wrong done by themselves? How can it be their own doing, someone asks, when someone is scourged by another, or their belongings are taken away, or they endure some other grievous offense and they utter blasphemy? The harm occurs from this, and the greatest harm is not from the offender, but from one's own faint-heartedness. As I said before, and I will say again: no human being, however much they might be ten thousand times wicked, not even that demon devastator, holding irreconcilable hostility against us, could strike more wickedly or more bitterly. Yet this harsh demon did not succeed in overthrowing or defeating the one before the law, before grace, after unleashing such bitter arrows against him from all sides. Now, indeed, with us, many in mourning let their hair grow, but he cut his. Why? Because for the mourner, the earnestness was to overturn their condition to the opposite appearance. Therefore, where hair is honored, cutting is a sign of mourning. He tore his garments, with respect to form, lamenting a condition, but in truth, stripping for a contest, and thus devoting himself to the battle, to grapple as a naked athlete with the opponent.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And having fallen to the ground, he worshipped the Lord, and said, “Naked I came out from the womb of my mother, and naked I shall return there.”"</i><sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This Job cut down the face of the devil, being struck, not striking; he emptied his whole quiver, being continuously shot at by him; he endured every kind of trial and each with all-exceeding measure. For the things seeming to be in life as painful are especially such.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Painful indeed are these things, and being especially of all, poverty, and sickness, and the loss of children, and the uprising of enemies, and the ingratitude of friends, and famine, and continual pains of the flesh, and revilings, and slanders, and the reputation of having acquired things wickedly. And all these were poured into one body and scattered into one soul, and what's more grievous, that it came upon one who was without preparation. What I am saying is such: He who is born of the poor and raised in such a house, being thus exercised and trained, can easily bear the burden of poverty. But he who is surrounded by so much wealth and indulging in such riches, when suddenly fallen into the opposite state, cannot easily endure the change; for, being untrained, it seems more grievous when suddenly assailed. Again, a person unknown, born of unknown people, living in continual contempt, would not be greatly disturbed when reviled and insulted. But the one having enjoyed so much glory, escorted by all and being in the mouths of everyone, proclaimed everywhere with great emphasis on prominence, when disgraced and brought to humiliation, suffers the same as one who from wealth suddenly becomes a pauper. He who loses children, even if he loses them all, not at one time but across time, finds consolation in those remaining for those departed. And as for the first one's death, after the loss's pain has subsided, if the second occurs later, this suffering becomes more bearable; for it comes not to a fresh wound but to one already rested, and diminished, which alleviates no small part of the agony. But this person saw his entire group snatched away in a single instant of time, in the most bitter manner of death; for both the death was violent and untimely. The time and the place also added not a little to the mourning; for it was in the midst of a banquet, in a house open to guests, and their home became their tomb. And what is more wondrous, he endured all these things together, which makes the afflictions double, nay triple; for when one has not even the consolation of respite, but through the uninterrupted sequence of afflictions, the clamor becomes greater, and the turmoil more intense, which happened in this case. For the loss of sheep and the burning was followed by the capture of the cattle; and this by the removal of the donkeys, and this by the capture of the camels, and the slaughter of the servants; and this by the loss of children, and that dreadful and novel death, the most horrendous burial, becoming both death and tomb at once. And the table, which just now entertained, now received the bodies after being slaughtered; and the cups and goblets, with the wine, received blood and dismembered limbs. Consider the magnitude of the misfortune, and that strange shipwreck, and the alien and paradoxical tragedy. For otherwise one might have lost a son, or a second, or a third, yet mournfully such a number, and the one with many children suddenly became childless; and not by little were his entrails consumed, but all at once the fruit was snatched away; and not by the common law of nature, nor having reached old age, but untimely and violent death, and all together, and not even being present, nor sitting by, to hear at least the last words, to have any consolation in such a bitter end. But beyond all hope, knowing nothing of what was happening, suddenly all were swallowed up, and the house became for them both tomb and trap. Not only was the death untimely, but also there were many things accompanying it that caused grief, such as all being in their prime, all virtuous, all friendly, all together, from both sides of nature, and not one left behind, nor by the common law of nature, but after such loss, with nothing evil known to himself or to them, to suffer these things. For each of these alone is sufficient in itself.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">To become troubled; but when both together appear to be converging, consider the height of the waves, how great the excess of the storm. Yet he did not say anything of that sort, as some weaker ones might say: "For this, have I raised my children and with all diligence trained them? For this, have I opened my house to those passing by, that after those many journeys, on behalf of the needy, on behalf of the naked, on behalf of the orphans, I might receive these rewards?" But instead of these, upon the misfortune of the children, he offered what is greater than any sacrifice, which crowned that holy head more than countless wreaths and proclaimed more brightly than many trumpets; for he said: "Naked I came from my mother's womb, naked also shall I depart; for these were not mine, and shortly I was to be separated from them. For we brought nothing into the world, it is clear that we cannot take anything out." And before these words, having fallen to the ground, he worshipped. Although he suffered such things, he did not depart from piety towards God, but having fallen upon the earth, he cast down him who had said: "Truly he will bless you to your face." He showed nature, he also showed piety; for having wisely demonstrated sympathy concerning the children, he surpasses the passion with courage and no longer proceeds to laments, but utters those divine words: "For naked, he says, I came forth from my mother's womb, naked also will I depart there." Of what womb does he speak? Perhaps, indeed, the original creation he calls the womb, claiming the creation of man from the earth as naked and free from all wickedness. So that the meaning is such: "Naked I was formed from the earth by divine grace, plain and as if immaterial, therefore naked also will I depart there." To where? Clearly, to the place free from mourning. For if you should take the thought in a readily understood sense, and suppose that having come forth from the maternal womb, to it again I will return, neither is the propriety of speech preserved, nor the harmony of the expression. For who among the sensible would wrong nature with his own mind, returning to the womb of the mother him who came from it, thus corrupting each by both, achieving a double murder with one tale? Since Nicodemus too, hearing about the baptismal rebirth, "Unless one is born from above," answered grossly and humbly; for he thought he heard of a birth from flesh, drawn downward by his thoughts, and imagining nothing elevated.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away; as it pleased the Lord, so it has happened; may the name of the Lord be blessed."</i><sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Job indeed grieved, yet to the extent one would expect from a father who loves his children, and is greatly concerned for those who have departed. He did not say, as many do, "It would have been better not to have had the experience or to have been called a father, than to fall after tasting the pleasure." Rather, for what he had received, he was thankful, and for what he did not have to the end, he gave glory. He did not say, "It would have been better not to have received this," as some say irrationally, but even for those things he gave thanks, saying, "The Lord has given." And for these, too, he blessed, saying, "The Lord has taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord." And he thus silenced his wife, defending himself to her, and uttering those marvelous words: "If we received good from the hand of the Lord, shall we not endure evil?" And while each of the other men is aware of many evil things in himself and knows the cause of his sufferings, which is no small comfort, he himself did not have this to consider, namely, that he was paying the penalty for transgressions, which most troubled his mind. When he looked at his own life, and his conscience shone brighter than the sun, and the multitude of his accomplishments, he knew that he was worthy of crowns, and rewards, and myriad prizes. But when he looked upon all that had happened, those last things he could not reconcile.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Daring, seeing himself suffering more grievous things, he could not even find the reason to say for which cause he was enduring these things. Because of this, having no reason to attribute to the calamity, he takes refuge in the incomprehensibility of God's plan and, referring the events to what seemed good to him, he said, "As it seemed good to the Lord, so it has happened. For I do not think it necessary to scrutinize the will of the Master. Let the name of the Lord be blessed." He says, "I will not utter any harsh word against God, but will judge Him worthy of hymns, for what He provided at first, and for what now He has decided to take away." With such words did the righteous man confound the devil. It is astonishing that, even considering what was taken away as from God, he gives thanks and is not disheartened. Do this also, and reason within yourself that it was not a man who took, but God who made you, who cares for you more, and knows what is beneficial, neither as an enemy nor a conspirator. Assist those departed, completing remembrance for them. For if the sacrifice of the spirit cleansed the children of Job, why do you doubt whether, when we offer for those departed, any comfort happens for them? For God is accustomed to grant to some on behalf of others. Let us be benefited according to what is perceived, for every creature follows the Creator; therefore, He gives to each according to what is beneficial, and takes away, training us in gratitude and endurance together. For gratitude for what is given was a premise for the second favor.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"In all these things that happened to him, Job did not sin with his lips against the Lord; and he did not attribute folly to God."</i><sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Just as with images, when we paint something, we inscribe below in little letters, "So-and-so dedicated this," so also here, having depicted the image of the soul of the righteous through words, the one who wrote the book, as if inscribing below in little letters, says, "In all these things Job did not sin with his lips against the Lord." Do not think that he was silent with men but not with God; rather, he did not sin even in thought. What is meant by "not even with his lips"? Often, being carried away by passion, we speak a word, even though our mind does not consent, but the tongue is carried away by despondency. Yet that man endured not even this, but his mind was clear of blasphemy, and his tongue was clear of evil words. He did not attribute folly to God, that is, he did not judge what happened as unjust; he did not say, as many do, "Things happen simply by chance," but, "As it seemed good to the Lord, so it happened." Thus, we should never relax our vigilance while we are here, but always fight, especially in times of sickness, when pains trouble the soul from all sides, when sufferings besiege, when the devil stands by, provoking us to speak a bitter word. At such times especially, one must secure oneself and arm with the shield of patience and the weapon of thanksgiving. For these are grievous darts against the devil, this is a timely wound; then most of all are the crowns glorious. Since this is what made blessed Job especially glorious, this is what he proclaimed—the resolution demonstrated in a time of trial, sickness, and poverty, to be unyielding and unshaken in mind, to offer words of thanksgiving to God and that spiritual sacrifice. For his words were a sacrifice, which he said, "The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away," and what follows. This is what we should always do, in trials, in distress, in plots, glorifying God. "And it came about as on this day, and the angels of God came to present themselves before the Lord."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"Of the Lord, and the devil came among them, to stand in front of the Lord." Why does he present them standing before him each day? So that we may learn that the present things are not unforeseen, but rather they give an account of what happens each day, and every day the angels are sent out managing affairs, even if we do not know.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And the Lord said to the devil, "From where do you come?""</i><sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">He knew from whence he came, because he was defeated by the just one; but he wishes to see if he acknowledges his defeat nobly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And the Lord said to the devil, "Have you given attention, then, to my servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth; a blameless man, true, without blemish, fearing God, abstaining from every evil, and still holding fast to his innocence; but you said to destroy his possessions without cause.""</i><sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">The devil, having concealed the defeat, used the first voice, saying: "And having gone around the earth, I am present." But God, what that one concealed out of envy, reveals; and since He did not learn from him the defeat he suffered when questioned, He Himself exposes it and manifests the victory of the just one: "Having walked about the entire world, I am present." What then? Did you go out for this purpose? Did you ask for this? Did you not say, "Give me the possessions of Job?" Why do you conceal the contest? To make the crown of victory disappear. "Have you paid attention to my servant, that there is no one like him, a blameless man?" Do not simply pass over what is said, but note that in the first testimony, the term "blameless" was not mentioned. But not having mentioned this name before, He now added the crown of blamelessness to him since he endured the evils with gratitude. If then anything seems daring in the following words, it is accounted to his blamelessness. Job himself later says, "The Lord knows my blamelessness." To the blameless, no word is reckoned as wickedness; for we judge not by actions, but by the intention of the doers. A son insults his father, and the act is impious, and he is condemned as one who wrongs a father, because he uttered a voice against his father and dared to defame his own root. But a blameless child, even if he strikes the father or the mother, the insult is considered more desirous than any joy. Often, then, mothers provoke their children to insult, not for the insult, but for the blamelessness, for the innocence, and for the simplicity of character, delighting in it; thus God, knowing that he speaks not out of wickedness, accepts the words from Job, being called into a judgment by him; for the word is of blamelessness, not of wickedness. "In vain you envied his abundance," he says, claiming that the man devout solely for the sake of wealth. He was stripped of possessions, yet was not stripped of piety. You did not wish, shameless one, to trust me as God. From the experience at least, it ought not to have been confirmed thereafter that my servant does not measure his philosophy by prosperity. Observe then, he did not say that the possessions were lost in vain, but, "You said to destroy in vain," since he himself did not receive just any reward for his loss.</p>

And it did not simply say, "Touch the flesh," but that the evil might also arise from within; thus after this, regarding wickedness, it is discussed.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And it is shown from here that the ancient serpent has no authority against us, unless it is permitted by God, according to His ineffable providence concerning us. And although he can destroy a man, if he receives permission, he cannot do harm, and he requests it from God. For he knows, even if he has fallen, that unless God allows it, by himself against anyone, he can do nothing, thus considering the permission as wisely occurring, as it occurs from God. What He says is this: remove his protection that comes from external service and the care of the soul; for it is not worthy of wonder if you guard him from harm; grant me to corrupt his flesh up to the very marrow. For he knows how to correct the uninstructed mind through misfortune, considering luxury as the only expectation of your service, when indeed you touch his flesh, at that time he will bless you to your face, that is, he will openly blaspheme you.</p>

And he said, "Touch his flesh." But so that he may not say, "You have struck him openly, like your own servant," He did not do what the devil asked, but allowed it to him. But see, He did not only say, "Do not touch his soul," but also, "Only preserve his soul," putting him into great fear; "The salvation of his soul," He says, "I seek from you." Because it was likely that such an attack could be made upon them as to kill the body, and he could have said, "I did not touch his soul." Therefore, He says, preserve it, lest he suffer anything concerning the principle of life; for if you take him away, the spectacle is no longer completed for us.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And he struck Job with a malignant sore, from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head."</i><sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">He smote him, it is said, with the most grievous torment, with suffering and disease upon the whole body; for his whole body was made one wound, one bruise, so that through all his limbs he might be shown as a crown-bearer. For wickedness does not know mercy, being a destruction possessing its own most bitter disposition.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And he took a potsherd to scrape the discharge, and he sat upon the ashes outside the city."</i><sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Why then did he not scrape away the ichor with hands or fingers? So that the healing would not become a greater occasion for disgust. But he himself, not enduring to heal himself, how could he obtain healing for others? He was his own executioner, not piercing the ribs, but cutting around the oozing decay, and in scraping off the living clay with dead clay. Why then did he sit upon a dung heap? So that he might cover the falling with the dung heap. Why then outdoors? So as not to suffocate himself with the stench; which he would have suffered, if indeed confined in some little house. Besides, the tempter had left no house to him. For the loss of the children was heavy, yet nonetheless he awaited a worse tragedy, and was not even slightly breathing again. Hence the sources of worms, the streams of ichors, the seat upon the dung heap, the potsherd, scraping the ribs, the stench of the sores, introducing that new famine, and not allowing sight to touch the foods, and placing a loathing worse than famine, and these things not for two, ten, twenty, or even a hundred days, but for more months. Not moderately indeed will those in pain be comforted by the examples of Job, and the wounds of the righteous, and the dung heap, more honorable than any royal throne. For from seeing a royal throne, there will be no gain to the beholders, but only temporary delight, having no benefit; but from seeing the dung of Job, anyone will receive all benefit and much philosophy, and consolation in word of endurance.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For this reason, many now undertake some long journey over the sea, running from the ends of the earth to Arabia, so that they may see that dung and having beheld it, kiss the ground which received the sores of that crowned one and the blood more valuable than all gold. For neither is purple so brilliant, as that body then shone, not when bathed in another's, but in its own blood; and those wounds were more valuable than all stones. For the nature of pearls does not benefit our life at all, nor fulfills any necessary need for those possessing them; but those wounds, they are a consolation for all despondency. And so that you may learn that this is true, if one were to lose a trueborn and only son, show him countless pearls, and you will not console the grief, nor heal the pain. But remind him of the wounds of Job, and you will easily be able to heal, saying thus: Why do you mourn, man? You have lost one child, but that blessed one, after the whole choir of children was taken away, received a blow in his own flesh, and sat naked on the dung flowing with pus on every side, with his flesh wasting little by little, the righteous, the god-fearing, having God as witness of his virtue. For if you say these words, you will extinguish all despondency of the one mourning, and you will remove all pain; thus the wounds of the righteous become more useful than pearls. Therefore, draw for yourselves the athlete, and consider seeing that dung, and him sitting in the midst, the golden man, the adorned, whom, how I do not know to say. For I have not yet found such a precious material to compare to that body covered in wounds. Thus also than every material most precious, the nature of that remaining flesh was more precious, and the wounds more bright than the solar rays; for these light up the appearances of the body, but those illuminate the eyes of our mind, those thoroughly blinded the devil; therefore, after that wound, he jumped away, and was no longer visible. But you, my beloved, learn from here what the profit of tribulation is; for when the righteous man was wealthy and enjoyed leisure, he had one to accuse him falsely, yet he had one to say: Does Job fear God for nothing? But when he stripped him and made him poor, no longer did he dare to make a sound. And when he was rich, he threatened to wrestle with him and promised to overthrow; but when he made him poor and deprived of all, and plunged into extreme pain, then he jumped away; and when his body was intact, he restrained his hands, but when he cut his flesh, then he fled defeated. Do you see how much poverty is better than wealth, and sickness than health, and trial better than leisure for those keeping sober, and it makes those who struggle more useful, more splendid, more vigorous? Who has seen, who has heard such marvelous wrestling? The boxers of external contests, when they cut their opponents' heads, then they win and are crowned; but he, when he cut the body of the righteous with various wounds, and made it weaker, then he was defeated and withdrew. And when he pierced him from every side, to him nothing more happened; for he did not plunder the treasure lying within, but made it more manifest to us, and through that piercing, gave all to look inward and comprehend the entire wealth within; and when he expected to prevail, then with much shame he withdrew and no longer uttered a word. What happened, O devil? Why do you retreat? Did not everything happen as you wished? Did you not take away all that he had?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The flocks, the herds, the droves of horses, of mules; did you not also destroy the choir of children, and cut down all the flesh? Why do you withdraw? Because, he says, all things have happened, whatever I willed; but what I especially wanted to happen, and for which I did everything, this did not happen; for he did not blaspheme. For this reason, he says, I was doing all those things, so that this would come forth; and since this did not happen, nothing more resulted for me from the damage of the possessions, and from the loss of the children, and from the affliction of the body; but contrary to what I wanted, it turned out brighter, I made the enemy more illustrious, and worked out more cheerfully. Have you recognized how much the gain from the affliction? For indeed the body was good and healthy; but it became much more venerable, being cut by those wounds. For even wool is good before it is dyed, but when it becomes purple, it assumes unspeakable beauty and great grace. If he had not stripped him, we would not have known the strength of the victor; if he had not pierced his body with wounds, the rays would not have shone from within; if he had not sat him upon the dung-heap, we would not have known his wealth; for not even a king sitting upon a throne was so illustrious, as that one was notable and conspicuous when he was sitting upon the dung-heap then; for after the royal throne, death follows, but after that dung-heap, the kingdom of the heavens. I have presented this story not so that you may praise the words, but so that you may imitate the virtue of the man, and his patience; so that through his deeds you may learn that nothing human is terrible, but only sin. Not poverty, not sickness, not insult, not spite, not dishonor, not death itself which seems to be the ultimate of evils; for these are only names, to those philosophizing, names of misfortunes, devoid of reality; but the true misfortune is to stumble before God and to do something displeasing to Him. It remains to make a comparison of accomplishments and sufferings, so that you may clearly learn that not only in accomplishments, but also in sufferings, are there rewards, and very great rewards, and in sufferings not less than in accomplishments, rather sometimes even more than in accomplishments. And let us introduce, if it seems right, the great athlete of patience, who shone in these both, so that you may see whence he shone more greatly; let us then see by comparing, when he was brighter, when he was a common harbor for those in need, or when he suffered the painful things, and much despondency was put into him; when he opened his house to all who passed by, or when, his house having fallen, he spoke not a bitter word, but blessed God; although the former was an accomplishment, the latter a suffering. When was he more radiant, tell me? When he sacrificed for the children, and brought them together for harmony, or when they were buried, having ended their life in the most bitter manner, with much philosophy he bore the event? When did he shine forth more? When from the shearing of his sheep the naked shoulders were warmed, or when, upon hearing, "Fire fell from heaven and consumed the herd with the shepherds," he was not disturbed, nor troubled, but meekly bore the misfortune? When was he greater? When with the health of his body he used to come to the aid of those wronged, crushing the molars of the wicked, and snatching prey from between their teeth, becoming a harbor for them, or when he saw his body, the weapon of those wronged, being consumed by worms, and sitting upon the dung-heap, he scratched himself with a potsherd? "For I am dissolving lumps of earth by scraping off blood," he says. Though all those were accomplishments, these were all sufferings; yet these made him more illustrious than those. For this was the most bitter part of the contest for him, requiring greater bravery, and a more vigorous spirit, and a higher mind.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And having greater love for God. Therefore, for this reason, although those things happened shamefully and exceedingly insolently, nevertheless the devil countered, saying: "Does Job fear the Lord for nothing?" But when these things happened, having covered himself, he withdrew, giving his back, and not having even the shadow of shameless contradiction to present.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"When much time had passed, his wife said to him: "How long will you endure, saying, 'Behold, I await a little more time, expecting the hope of my salvation?'""</i><sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And he, as his contest further progresses, again assumes other crowns, from the words directed towards the woman. For indeed, the woman was left alone with him, everything else having vanished from him, both children and possessions, and even his own body, and she, as a trial and plot; thus the devil did not destroy her along with the children, nor did he request her slaughter, since he greatly expected her to contribute to the plan against this saint; for this reason, as if some great weapon, he left her to him. For if, he says, through her I expelled Adam from paradise, much more will I be able to overthrow Job from the dung heap. And observe the malice: neither with the loss of the oxen did he bring forth this scheme, nor with the donkeys, nor with the camels, nor with the house being fallen, nor with the burying of the children, but remained silent and quiet until that time, observing the athlete; but when the source of worms gushed forth, and the rotting skin was draining, and the flesh was consumed, causing a discharge filled with much stench that made the sensation more painful than pans, and furnaces, and any flame, the hand of the devil consumed him, devouring him more fiercely than any beast on every side, and consuming the body; and in this misfortune much time passed, then he brings her forth, already having been embalmed and worn out. For if she had approached at the beginning of the misfortune, he would not have found him worn out like this, nor would she have had the misfortune thus to swell and to be lifted by speech. But now when she saw him, because of the long duration of time thirsting for release, and desiring intensely the end of the trials, then she approaches. For when he was severely worked over, and no longer even able to breathe, but even wished to die, listen to what he says: If only I could have power over myself, or request another, and he would do this for me. And observe the malice of the woman, from where she immediately begins from the length of time: Until when will you endure? she says. If then many times, even when there were no deeds, words alone could weaken, consider what he likely suffered then, with these words and the painful deeds afflicting him; and what is worse than everything, that indeed a woman was saying these things, and a woman falling and giving up, and thus striving to also cast him into despair. But in order that we may see more clearly the scheme brought to this adamantine wall, let us also hear the words themselves. So what are these? Until when will you endure, saying, Behold I am waiting a little longer, expecting the hope of my salvation. For the time, she says, reproved your words, becoming longer, while showing no deliverance. These things she spoke, not only casting him into despair, but also reproaching, and ridiculing; for he, always troubled yet comforting her, and brushing off, spoke such things, waiting a little longer, and soon there will be an end to these. Reproaching, therefore, she says, will you not now say the same again? For much time has already passed, and no end of these has appeared. Why do you weaken the athlete, O woman? Why do you slacken the hands? One ought to say, Yet a little longer. And observe the malice: she does not mention the oxen, nor the sheep, nor the camels; for he knew that he was not severely vexed by these things, but he immediately goes to nature and reminds him of his children.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For upon them he saw him, and having torn his garment and shaved his head; and he did not say, "Your children have perished," but with great compassion.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Behold, your memory has vanished from the earth; sons and daughters, the pangs and labors of my womb, whom I labored over in vain with toil."</i><sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Originally, the desire for children was poignant because each left behind a memorial and remnants of their own life. For since there were not yet hopes of resurrection, but death prevailed, and those departing were thought to perish even after this life; God gave the comfort through children so that living images of those departed would remain, and our race would be preserved, and for those about to die and their friends the offspring of those would be the greatest consolation. And to learn that for this reason children were especially desired, listen to what the woman laments to Job after the many and indescribable blows: "Behold," she says, "your memory has perished from the earth." And again Saul to David: "Swear to me, that you will not destroy my seed, nor my name after me." For even now, with resurrection revealed, children are valuable as they preserve the memory of the departed, much more so then. This is why the curse is rendered more bitter: for there he who curses does not speak of children being wiped out, but "may his memory be wiped out from the earth." Sons and daughters. But saying "memory" again accurately, she remembers each nature. "Neither son," she says, "nor daughter remains to preserve the memory by succession;" almost saying that even if it were possible to regain health, the enjoyment of health without children is useless; for the ancients placed hope for permanence in children, and foreshadowed the future promise through mortal resurrection. She does not mention possessions, nor livestock; for she knew him noble, but what most could touch him. "What," she says, "change do you expect? Is there not any longer hope for the lost to return? Childless, without children, root and branch destroyed, with nothing left by which you might be remembered." "And if," she says, "you do not care about these things, at least consider mine." And observe the emotional aspect: "The labor pains and sufferings of my womb, with which I labored in vain with toil; labor pains of birth and sufferings of raising." What she says is this: The one who has borne more has been wronged for your sake, and while I underwent the toils, I have been deprived of the fruits. She says these things to show she herself shares in the misfortune; for a counselor seems unpersuasive who philosophizes about others' evils. Therefore, through all these words, hurling an arrow of disdain, she intertwines her own presence so that through the memory of the children and her own suffering, she might more strongly incite the just one to desperation. "Why," she says, "while always driving away the present, do you futilely encourage yourself with hopes of the future, childless, homeless, naked, ruined?"</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"But you yourself sit in the decay of worms, spending the night under the open sky."</i><sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Great emphasis, he himself, that righteous one, the marvelous one, the chief of our goods. And see how he neither places the loss of the goods nor remains silent about it and passes it over, but as was possible, and with much feeling to report it, thus he hints; for when he says the following:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And I, wandering and a servant, (went) from place to place and from house to house."</i><sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For the sake of daily sustenance, having acquired such an abundance of goods. To say: Not only have we lost our children, the subjects of our remembrance, and you yourself are pressed by so many afflictions, but we have also endured utter poverty, choosing sustenance like hired hands, we who abundantly provided resources to those in need. As for me, I have not even prospered through servitude, nor is it possible to alleviate the shame of poverty in a single household, but I wander, serving and pitifully begging, I who was once raised in freedom. See how she intertwines his matters with hers: "If yours do not prevail," she says, "let mine prevail." Having mentioned what is the most pitiable of all, moving from house to house, she did not stop her lamentations even there, but she continued, saying:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Awaiting the sun when it will set, so that I may rest from my toils, and from the pains that hold me fast."</i><sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">That which is sweet to others, he says, to behold the ray, this is burdensome to me; desirable indeed is the darkness. And the night, for it alone grants me rest from toil, it becomes my comfort in evils; it calls to me and relieves me from labors, day, sending the sun to the west; for night knows how to heal the evil, having the darkness as its dwelling. Indeed, having renounced misfortunes, and filled with diabolic activity, it suggests to the righteous that this is to them the solution of evils, the release of the body; it is possible for this to be added to them, if by blasphemy they provoke God, and lead themselves to destruction; but with wicked art, it introduces such a counsel, constructing the argument from the man's and her own misfortunes. The labor pains, he says, I have endured, I toiled raising children, that after you I may leave your memory, your children; this hope is cut off, all perished, both males and females alike; to whom then shall I look? To you, their father, full of worms, the beggar, the castaway? To me, the wretched, the wanderer, serving for hire from great happiness, examined in pains and labors until evening, but if you obey me in anything, speak a word to God, provoking Him, that He may take you away; for this alone remains to you as the solution of evils; therefore it concludes.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"But speak a word unto the Lord, and end."</i><sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Behold even here the malice, how not even in the very counsel did she immediately introduce the destructive advice, but after first narrating pitiably the misfortunes and extending the tragedy, she places the advice in brief; and she does not clearly manifest it, but shading it, she offers him the relief, which is most desirable, and promises an end, what he most longed for. And consider from this point the malice of the devil; for knowing Job's affection concerning God, he does not allow the wife to accuse God, so that she might not be immediately repelled as an enemy; therefore, she does not mention Him at all, but turns around the events up and down. And you, along with the things said, that it was also a woman counseling these things, add to it, a rhetorician skilled at bewitching those who are not attentive; indeed, many, even apart from misfortunes, have been brought down by the advice of women alone; and here, as a stronger device than the previous plots, he introduces the wife to the righteous man later; oh, would that you had taken even her, oh wicked one, would that you had buried her with the children. Some say the words are not the woman's, but that he, impressed upon her, speaks these things; for it is not likely that the wife of Job would be such; unless someone would say, having turned by the misfortune she became such; but it is likely, this being not the first counsel, but that the righteous man often heard from his wife much more grievous things than these. And observe the wickedness of the devil: he had recourse to a woman again, as with Eve.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For, he says, it brought down the first man, thus it will also be able to prevail over this one. But, O foolish one, having found that man weaker than his appetite, it sowed its own poison; but you see this one being philosophical and having prevailed over its nature. He was not bent by the loss of wealth, nor by the untimely death of children, nor by the unrelenting torture of the body, nor by such a long duration. And the one who was not captured by things, do you expect to subdue this one with words? Yet, after the woman narrates the tragedy precisely, then she brings forth the shameless counsel, and even then she does not say openly, "Blaspheme." For those giving wicked counsel do not dare to introduce their advice openly. What do you say, O woman? When it is necessary to propitiate, to reconcile, do you rather advise to provoke? For if God did these things, it is necessary to entreat Him, not to blaspheme.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And he, looking intently, said to her: "You have spoken as one of the foolish women.""</i><sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Basil and Chrysostom. Distressed by these words, Job, as by none of the former evils, filling his gaze with anger, and turning to the woman as to an adversary, and looking at her bitterly, before speaking, from his countenance dispelled her machinations. For she expected to stir the springs of tears; but he, becoming fiercer than a lion, filled with anger and indignation, not because of what he suffered, but because of what she advised diabolically. And showing his anger through his gaze, he makes the rebuke measured, for even in misfortunes he was prudent. And what does he say? "As one of the foolish women you have spoken;" he says, "I did not educate you thus, nor did I raise you thus; hence I do not recognize my own companion. For these words are of a senseless woman, and the advice is of one who is deranged. Lay aside," he says, "woman, the counsel, how long will you insult the common life with your words? You lied, and as I did not pray, you slandered my upbringing, in what you said; and I have now reckoned my life half-wicked, since marriage made one body of both of us, but you have fallen into blasphemy. You saw a measured incision and a sufficient blow to correct the ailment. He did not say, 'You are foolish and senseless;' but what did he say? 'As one of the foolish women you have spoken;' that is, 'You have spoken nothing worthy of yourself or my education.' Then after the rebuke, he introduces advice again, sufficient to console her, and possessing much reasonableness, saying:"</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"If we have received good things from the hand of the Lord, shall we not endure the bad things?"</i><sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Remember, he says, those former things, and consider the cause, and you will bear these things also nobly. Did you see the moderation of a man? For he does not attribute his endurance to his bravery, but says it is due to the sequence of events. For in exchange for what did God give us those things? What repayment did He exact? None, but out of goodness alone. For it was a gift, not a repayment, and a grace, not a recompense; therefore, let us also bear these things nobly. Remember the good things that have come to you, compare the better to the worse. No human life is blessed throughout; always doing well is for God alone. If you are in pain over present matters, console yourself with past ones. Now you weep, but you laughed before; now you are poor, but you were rich before. You drank the clear stream of life, and drinking this muddy one, be patient; nor are the currents of rivers seen to be clear throughout. Our life, as you know, is a river, perpetually flowing and filled with successive waves; for part of it has already flowed past, part is still proceeding, part has just emerged from the springs, and part is yet to be, and we all hasten to the common sea of death. Shall we not endure the evils if we received the goods from the hand of the Lord? Do we compel the judge to provide us with similar things for eternity?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do we instruct the Master on how it is necessary to conduct our life? He holds the authority over His own decrees; as He wishes, He arranges our affairs. He is wise and measures what is profitable for His servants. Do not meddle with the judgment of the Master, love only what is managed by His wisdom. Whatever He gives you, accept with pleasure, showing in adverse times that you were also worthy of joy previously. By saying these things, Job repelled even this assault of the devil and brought upon him the complete shame of defeat. He demonstrated through his countenance the greatest zeal against sin (for nature acknowledges the eye as the accuser of hidden things), and he, having endured such an attack from the wicked one calmly and philosophically, did not succumb to the suggestion of evil, regarding wicked hearsay as greater than bodily wounds, and he rebuked his wife. For as he says, "As we received treatment gladly, so let us prudently endure correction." He calls the good things those that bring joy, and the bad things, trials. Some have taken the phrase 'as one of the foolish women who spoke' to apply to Eve, saying, "You have imitated her who first received the cloud of sin and was deceived by similar counsels, that one who was honored with the image of God and free from all wickedness." For this blessed man, assailed from every side, stood more securely and, receiving myriad arrows, did not give in. Instead, he emptied the devil's quiver while he himself did not fall nor was he overthrown. But like an excellent navigator, he was neither sunk by a stormy sea when the waves were stirred up nor was he made more indolent when there was calm, but in each differing season, he maintained his own skill unchanged. Neither did wealth puff him up, nor did poverty humble him, nor was he carried along the stream of circumstances, nor did he collapse when the whole household was almost destroyed, nor was he disturbed, nor did he doubt his own courage. Let the rich hear, let the poor hear, for the narrative is useful to both and a beneficial story for all people, for those in prosperity and for those in hardships. Having employed both types of arms, the fighter for godliness, the crowned one of the world, erected his trophy in both circumstances, and against every type of war, when that demon attacked, he arrayed himself and was proclaimed victorious in all things. And as a brave soldier, knowing how to fight at night, to attack walls, to battle on foot and in naval engagements, to use the bow, to brandish a spear and with slings and javelins, and to prevail through every kind of combat against the adversaries and hold victory everywhere, so indeed did that valiant man endure every trial with much courage: those from poverty, those from famine, those from disease, those from pain, those from the loss of children, those from friends, those from enemies, those from his wife, those from servants. For there was no human misfortune that was not emptied upon his body, yet he surpassed all the nets and rose higher than the traps of the devil. And the most wondrous thing is that it was all for him and all exceedingly, and all under one circumstance. Do not see only that he suffered so much but add that it was not little, nor at intervals, but under one and simultaneously. This is no small increase of trials. For each of the other men, no one would be found who endures everything at once. But even if someone struggles with poverty, he still enjoys health; if embroiled in both poverty and disease, often he has the comfort of a wife soothing harsh circumstances, acting like a harbor for him. But even if he did not enjoy such a wife but had one offering destructive advice; even if having such advice offered destructively, yet he did not additionally encounter all these trials at once as Job did.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The children he destroyed all at once; even if all at once, yet not in such a manner of death; and if in such a manner of death, yet he had friends comforting him; and if he did not have those comforting him, yet they were not attacking him as well; and if they were attacking him, yet not the servants reproaching him; and if reproaching him, yet not spitting upon his face; and if spitting upon his face, yet he was not afflicted by such a disease; and if afflicted by such a disease, yet he enjoyed the shelter of a house, and did not sit on the dung heap; and if he sat on the dung heap, yet he had those extending a hand; and if he did not have those extending a hand, yet they were not attacking him as well; this one indeed endured all these things. For being amidst these, and being thoroughly cooked from every side, within and without, he was doing the contrivances of his wife, and his partner becomes the weapon of the demon, and she shoots at the man, lending her tongue to the devil, and strikes more bitterly and disastrously than what had been said. And not even there did the contests take an end, but again it was a beginning and prelude of the confrontation; and he was struck myriad times by the reproaches of his friends. Have you not wearied listening to these successive misfortunes? But he did not grow weary suffering. Therefore I entreat your love to wait again; for we have not yet spoken everything, nor have we added the second excess. Indeed, one was that all the human evils one body endured. Another was that all together, and he did not have relief for the suffering one. And I wish to state a third; what then is this? That each of those things mentioned did not occur together only, but with much excess and novelty; whether poverty, more grievous than any poverty, whether disease, whether seat, whether the loss of children, whether of all possessions. Consider then, someone lost possessions, but not so completely, nor in such a manner. He lost children, but never all under one circumstance, and not so many nor so distinguished. He fell into disease, but not such as this, but either fevers, or injury, or some other familiar suffering. But that affliction was foreign, clear only to the sufferer; for no account could convey the bitterness of those wounds, and the painfulness of the injuries; but it suffices only to mention the one who wrought it, and his unrestrained passion, to indicate the severity of the affliction. New also was the seat, and strange; for there is not, there is not any pauper, ever seated thus exposed throughout all time, as that one endured naked of garments, deprived of all shelter, sitting on the dung heap. Someone had an evil wife often, but none ever became so evil, as to attack her husband in such misfortune, and sharpen a sword against his soul, and advise such counsel. And the behavior of the friends was strange, and that of the servants; and the novelty of the famine was again, since it did not occur with the table set nearby. Let me also mention a fourth excess, I mean the former wealth and prosperity; for he who from the beginning lived in poverty would more easily endure it, having practiced the suffering; but he, cast down from such prosperity, due to the lack of exercise and unaccustomedness, endures the perception more grievously and the pain more bitterly, and the turmoil greater. Let me also mention another excess, especially crowning and proclaiming that athlete, and demonstrating his soul high and touching the heavens. What then is this? The difference from the time; for before grace, and before the law he philosophized thus, having not partaken of teaching, having not engaged in letters, nor books, nor seen others like him, nor having the means to look back to the previous time and consider those who succeeded; for neither was there scripture, or history handing down things done; but in unexperienced times he had no example to look back upon.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">On the journey, on the open sea, in such a deep gloom of wickedness, he alone and first at that time cut this path of philosophy, having been shown to be the foremost with surpassing excellence in the chief of goods. For it is significant to accomplish even the lesser parts of virtue, but much greater to be supreme in the highest of all; and that the highest of all is endurance, no one will contradict. Therefore, knowing this even the devil himself said: "Skin for skin, and all that a man has he will give for his life. But put forth your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh." From this, it is evident that this achievement is supremely important, requiring a certain youthful and iron-like soul. But I do not marvel at Job before the wife's advice as much as after that destructive counsel. And let no one consider it paradoxical what is spoken; for many times those whom the nature of things has not overthrown, a word and corrupt counsel have brought down. Therefore, the devil knowing this, after the blow from experience, also brings a further attack through words. The same he did with David; for seeing him bear nobly the rebellion of his son and that unlawful tyranny, desiring to overthrow his mind and persuade him to fall into anger, he sent that Shimei to afflict his soul with bitter words. This he also committed against Job; for seeing him mock his arrows and as if standing like an adamantine tower nobly against all, he armed the wife, that the counsel might become unsuspected, and concealed the poison in her words and dramatized the calamity. What then did the noble one do? "You have spoken as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed receive good from God, and shall we not accept evil?" For if He were not the Lord, he says, nor greatly superior to us, but a certain equal friend, what excuse would we have, having been so greatly benefited, and not bearing the contrary? You see a man who loves God, and how he does not boast nor take pride in having nobly endured those beyond nature blows, nor does he consider such patience to be of wisdom and great-mindedness; but as paying a necessary debt, and suffering nothing unreasonable, so from abundance he silenced the woman.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"In all these things that happened to him, Job sinned not with his lips before God."</i><sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">It is not, he says, to be said that towards the woman he was saying these things, but the unutterable things of his mind were full of passion and abhorrence, yet he did not even utter anything with his lips. The Hebrew does not have it, thus expressing the meaning sufficiently in advance.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Hearing, then, his three friends all the evils that had come upon him, they came each from his own land to him."</i><sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">The three friends indeed arrive, in order to offer comfort, but they do the opposite of consolation. While their presence is friendly, their counsel is not friendly; and even before their words, the mere sight of them was enough to cast down the righteous one. For our own troubles, especially in the prosperity of others, we more precisely discern. Consider how great it was, to see oneself in these troubles, and those familiar and known ones remaining in their former prosperity. And what was grievous, that disaster circulated everywhere; for if those, who were at such a distance, heard, much more those who were near. But what grieved him most was not the magnitude of the calamities, but seeming to suffer as an impious and lawless one, as an enemy of God and adversary, having lived previously in hypocrisy. He did not care about the corruption of the body, but about the downfall of his reputation; not because he was ambitious, living for the opinion of the many, but because he saw many being scandalized by these things. The writer also mentions the names of the friends.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And none of them spoke."</i><sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For once a soul has been struck by despondency, it is unfit for any hearing. Therefore, these men, having seen the tragedy of that household and the just man sitting on the dung heap and afflicted with sores, tore their garments, lamented greatly, and sat in silence, showing that nothing is so suitable at the beginning for those in pain as quiet and silence; for the suffering was greater than comfort from speech. They came indeed to console, but, finding no means by which they might give comfort, kept silent. And they did this wisely, comforting him by their presence, by sitting beside him, by tearing their garments. But all these things were indeed noble, worthy of friends, and proofs of sympathy; yet the things that followed, no longer.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"After this, Job opened his mouth."</i><sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Polychronius and Chrysostom. Precisely, however, it lies in this manner. For seeing many coming to him and then going away, he remained enduring in his sufferings. But when he beheld those with Eliphaz arriving with sincerity and staying for a long time, who also testified to the grievousness of what had happened through their silence (for they did not dare to console him unless he first gave them leave), then indeed, considering their silence as troublesome for them, he breaks it. Let us see then, what he speaks when he opens his mouth.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And he cursed his day, saying: Let the day perish on which I was born, and that night in which they said: Behold, a male."</i><sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Let us not, therefore, simply examine the words, but let us see that they are also spoken from a despondent soul; for if he did not even utter these things, he might seem not to partake in the common nature.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"May that night be darkness; may the Lord above not seek it, nor may light come upon it. But may darkness and the shadow of death seize it."</i><sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Seeing the righteous man, as the weight of the events, he called his friends, and understanding the burden of the affliction, and judging the sitting beside him for a long time as burdensome and as not the same as before to them having been joined; and so to speak everything, seeing everything turned against him, neither does he dismiss them rudely, considering it unfitting to send away those who have come in honor with insult, nor does he simply urge them to depart, respecting their friendship. But considering all these things, and being bitten by all, he directed these words towards them, in a way as if apologizing to his friends: that he wished to converse, but is not able, being weighed down by the multitude of woes. What does he say? Let that night be darkness, that is to say, let it be in ignorance, not being remembered, nor let the Lord claim it, nor let it be placed in the enumeration of nights. For since he was not discoursing about an existing nature, or some living creature, he did not invoke death or destruction, but the opposite, that the day should have extension. As if the day, having been interposed, with respect to the extension of darkness to both nights, should come into oblivion for those wishing to count.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Why then did I not perish in the womb? But I came forth from the belly, and did I not immediately perish?"</i><sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Just as Christ, having said, "It were good for him if he had not been born," indicated nothing else except that dreadful and grievous things awaited him, so also here Job, saying, "Would that I had not been born, or having been born, had immediately perished, so that death would be simultaneous with birth," does not condemn the creation of God but reveals the magnitude of the misfortune. Observe, however, the piety, as he pours out all his anger on the day, not daring to surpass this boundary, but always speaking of these, the day and the night, so that he might say, "Until now, I have not experienced any of the present evils, even if I did not receive a reward for piety."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Now having lain down, I would have been at peace; having slept, I would have found rest."</i><sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">To me, it seems fitting to restrain friends and to persuade them not to consider human affairs to be of great significance. Therefore, observe even in misfortune the words of philosophy: "There the impious have kindled the fire of wrath; there they rested, weary in body."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But what do you say? I am impious and wicked, yet did they also partake of this consolation? Then follows the praise of death, for some have departed from wickedness, and others have been delivered from suffering. Some have found a harbor from dreadful things, others a hindrance to wickedness, and the greatest thing is that there is no longer any expectation of former matters, but to remain always resting upon rest, since it is the release from all evils.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"With one accord, however, the eternal ones did not hear the voice of the tax-gatherer."</i><sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Toward understanding, the holy word blesses those who have not heard the voice of the tax collector. For those who rise up against the desires of the flesh, and trample on authorities, and conquer the spiritual forces of wickedness, have become superior to the voice of the tax collector; that is, the devil, who demands from those who have willingly become subject to him a kind of tribute, the doing of things pleasing to him. But the righteous, since they have not listened to him to commit evil deeds, they prosper together in the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Small and great are there, and the servant fearing his lord."</i><sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Much, he says, is the irregularity in the present life, much is the freedom and equality after the departure from here. There is no need there to fear change, as here; death is an obstacle to evils, a release from suffering. The things that seem to be dreadful are dissolved; and he who once feared his own master there does not fear. All there attain, both small and great, that is, both he in honor and he in humility.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Why then is light given to those in bitterness, and life to the souls in pain?"</i><sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Chrysostom and Polychronius.

Therefore, the words are not to be accused, may it never be; for those spoken not with the same intention are not to be understood similarly; but he is in pain and seeking why those in misfortunes, about to be examined, come into life. For to the others, whether they are illustrious in life or in bodily health, this common discourse brings some consolation; but those who partake in none of these, suffering only in life, I do not know what benefit they will have by coming into life, and perhaps others may contribute something beneficial to life, but what will these do? From this we learn that not only life but death also has become useful, whenever it is desired in such a way; thus, he adds:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"They who long for death, and do not attain it, digging as for treasures; and they became exceedingly glad if they should find it."</i><sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For this reason, it says, "There is a season for every matter." And again, "O death, how bitter is your remembrance for a man at peace in his possessions, for an undistracted man, and successful in all things, and still strong enough to receive nourishment!" And again, "O death, how good is your judgment for a man in need, and weakened in strength, extremely aged, and distracted about all things, and disobedient, and having lost patience." For this reason also Job, being in misfortunes, desires death, and speaks these things, so that when you hear his wife advising him, "Speak a word against the Lord, and die," you may not think that he did not speak it out of love for life, but out of reverence. For he, considering death so desirable for himself, and deeming it a great good, did not dare to find it even when it was present.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Death is rest for a man; for God has enclosed against him."</i><sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This is a pronouncement: If therefore it is repose, why then do the many not hasten toward it? For this reason, God made life desirable to us, so that we might not hasten toward death.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For the fear which I considered came upon me, and that which I dreaded met me."</i><sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This was therefore the cause, that amidst such a storm, and with waves so unspeakably great, the righteous man stood bravely, because when he prospered, he anticipated poverty; when he was healthy, he expected sickness; when he became the father of so many children, he suddenly expected to be childless; and he always kept this fear with himself, and the expectation of evils.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">He nourished anxiety, knowing the nature of human affairs, and considering their transience; therefore he also said, "The fear which I dreaded has come upon me." And he said rightly, "has come upon me," as if he were saying, "To whom I was always coming in my thoughts; for always in his mind he went towards it, expecting it, hoping for it, and anticipating it." For even if he lived on in wealth, luxury, and great renown, he kept dreaming of others' misfortunes every day; because of this, nothing disturbed him when great and unbearable trials happened to him.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Neither did I have peace, nor did I rest, nor was I quiet; but wrath came upon me."</i><sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">He did not say, "I do not have peace, nor am I at rest;" but rather, "I have not had peace," in the past time. For even if the things that have happened in the past caused delight, the expectation of painful things did not allow rest, nor did it permit delight in the present. For this reason, what he practiced through words, having seen these come to pass in reality, he nobly endured what was previously practiced, and seeing these things present, which were anticipated by expectation, he was neither amazed nor disturbed. Rather, he says, "The expected wrath has come to me," that is, the bitter and incurable punishment, which I experienced, and which I practiced through trial.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Has it not often been spoken to you in toil? But who will endure the strength of your words?"</i><sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Labor the Scripture knows sin to call; as when it says, under his tongue is labor and toil. Therefore, Eliphaz says, "See, O Job, lest you have spoken anything in sin, and for this reason you now suffer thus." He did not say, "Lest you have done;" but, "Lest you have spoken;" for since his life was shining, and he had many memorials of virtue everywhere on the earth, he says, "Do not say this, even if your deeds are good and noble; for it happens that sin comes to be in words."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For if you have admonished many, and weak hands you have strengthened, and those who were weak you have raised up with words, and to knees that were failing you have given courage; but now distress has come upon you, and it has touched you, and you are troubled."</i><sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Chrysostom and Polycarp do not speak of what is accomplished by him in wealth, for it was possible to oppose poverty; but if he benefited some through words. What he says is this: "He battles," he says, "the current circumstances with the old perception; for the one who has often strengthened others with words and almost raised those who have fallen, instilling in them good hopes, what has happened to you? How can you not bear the labor that has come upon you? But you have been eager, that is, to be disturbed." The expression is taken from those who are hastened when disturbed. Yet it was necessary for you, reminding yourself of your own words and respecting them, not only to philosophize in the misfortunes of others but also in your own. Observe how, among other virtues, Eliphaz testifies to Job that he also had the gift of teaching and delivered a comforting word with divine grace, so that he even prepares those in misfortunes to be cheerful through exhortation. These words of Eliphaz are not yet harsh; what follows no longer speaks according to the character of one who offers consolation. Listen, then:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Is not your fear in foolishness? And your hope, and the wickedness of your way?"</i><sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Aquila, Your patience and the simplicity of your ways weave a vain reasoning. For since he said, "The fear which I anticipated came to me," he says, this fear was in folly, and your hope was from the wickedness of your heart. For it is foolish, being good, to expect such things; thus you have reproved yourself, that you were of an evil life. For if you trusted in purity, the fear is vain.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"From the command of the Lord they shall perish; and by the breath of His wrath they shall be annihilated."</i><sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">From the command of the Lord. "Do not suppose," he says, "that the occurrences are due to evil demons or to treacherous men. It is God who punishes; is it not, therefore, indisputable that the punishment is just?"</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"If there had been any true word in your sayings."</i><sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">The phrase, "If any true word has occurred in your speeches," suggests that often Job spoke certain solemn things, either leading some to zeal or for the sake of another purpose.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"If He does not trust His own children, and He conceived something crooked against His angels."</i><sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Well did he use the word "devised"; for through this he shows his wisdom, in order that the greatness of their nature might not exalt them, but that they might always be subjected to God. Indeed, even if he devised something severe against them, that is, he punished them for leaving their proper dwelling.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"He struck them with a blight, and from morning until evening, they are no more."</i><sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, “The moth struck them,” in the manner of, "easily and even the innermost parts he corrupted." And “he breathed on them,” that is, he did not require toil, but only wished, and it was fulfilled concerning them. This is said metaphorically of those who are angry, who have the custom of using a breath in place of a rebuke. And “From morning till evening they are no more,” he said, either because Job endured everything in a single day; or to show that God does not need time when punishing the impious.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For labor shall not depart from the land."</i><sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But Symmachus says, "For he will not go forth from dust pain."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Neither from the mountains shall labor spring forth; but man is born to toil; and the young of the vulture fly to the heights."</i><sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What then? Do they partake of greater providence? Away with the thought; since neither the earth nor the mountains do, as they happen to be insensible beings. For indeed, he says, it is a natural matter, unable to escape adversity. In order that no one might again say, "What is just?" he says that human nature is such that it is not without sin. So then, it is from nature that Eliphaz asserts, and he says, "It is the peculiar lot of mankind to be tested in misfortunes." As soon as one is born, he is allotted to toil, and his whole life is filled with labors and hardships. And for this reason, our nature is lesser compared to those growing from the earth and the mountains, having grief in both birth and growth. And to the birds it is given to fly without pain and to choose nourishment without toil; yet none of these belong to man without hardship.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"The one who gives rain upon the earth,

        <p class="paragraph">These things, he says, God does so that even the powerless may hope for good things, and the unjust might not be exalted but rather that the boastful tongue might be silenced, and the haughty brow might be humbled.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Blessed is the man whom the Lord has corrected; and do not refuse the admonition of the Almighty."</i><sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup></span></p>

Simply put, not only will those outside be disposed peacefully towards you, but also the household will enjoy much peace, and those within it will remain uncontentious, both among themselves and towards you. For nothing is equal to the peace within the household; for what benefit is it to be freed from external wars, if filled with turmoil within?</p>

Here, by "anger," he means despondency, and the emotion of the soul that arises from misfortunes; by "pains," the ones that occur in the body from wounds. And increasing the emotion by quantity, he declared it unanimously. What he says is as follows: You are philosophizing about others' evils, and standing far from my misfortunes, you advise me with much assurance; as if it were possible to take on my sufferings and pains and, as in a balance, counter-weigh them with the seashore sand, you would find those heavier than those, rather than the scale from that. He has taken up seashore sand because it is more moist.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">As if standing in a public theater of the world, the noble one speaks to all through the sufferings that have happened to him, to bear all that befalls nobly, and not to yield to any of the approaching trials. For there is not, there is not any human suffering which cannot receive consolation from there; for the sufferings which are scattered throughout the world, these gathered together fell upon his one body. What excuse, then, will there be for the one unable to bear with gratitude a portion of the afflictions brought upon him, who is seen bearing not just a portion, but the complete calamities of all men? For what has become poorer than Job? Who was poorer even than those cast into the baths, and those sleeping in the sooty ashes, and simply of all men poorer. For these at least have a tattered garment, but he sat naked, and the only garment he had from nature, the covering of flesh, the devil destroyed completely with grievous decay; and while some cover themselves even with a reed, he spent nights in the open air, having not even the comfort of a bare roof. And the greater fact is that while some bring many calamities upon themselves through which they might blame themselves (and this is not a small comfort in misfortune, to be aware that one is punished justly), he was deprived even of this consolation, and having demonstrated a life full of virtue, endured the things of those who have dared the utmost. And some prepared from the beginning for calamity, but he endured unprepared for poverty, and that to the extreme, after which no other can be found; for what could be poorer than being naked and having no shelter? Rather, he could not even be master of any ground; for he sat not upon the earth, but upon a dung heap. Therefore, this one was tried to the utmost.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Misfortune appears to be the underpinning of all evils together to humans. Second after that, or rather, more than that, is the blow to the body. For who has welcomed such a thing? Gradually, his body was consumed, and a source of worms from every part of his body gushed forth, and this flow was continuous, and from everywhere, the stench was great; and the body, gradually being divided and rotting in such corruption, made the foods unpleasant, and there was for him a strange and paradoxical hunger. For he could not enjoy the food that was given. "For my bread," he says, "I see as something noisome, as the smell of a lion." What could be more grievous than this punishment? Sleep did not bring rest, nor did food nourish. "As the smell of a lion," he says; for this beast is exceedingly fetid; since it has an inherent arrogance, God made it baser than the others. And they say that the remnants of its food are inedible to other animals because of the stench that emanates from them. What could one therefore say of that new and indescribable hunger? Voluntary, involuntary, for I do not know how to name it nor find a title for this novel kind of misfortune. For although the table was set before him, he refrained from it, and though he saw the foods, he did not touch them; for the stench from the wounds on his body, meeting him first, destroyed his appetite, and filled even the table itself with repulsion. And declaring this, he said, "For my bread I see as something noisome." And the necessity of hunger forced him to reach out for the provisions laid before him, but the overwhelming stench emanating from his flesh conquered the force of hunger. Therefore, as I said, I do not know how to call it; voluntary? But he wished to taste the things laid out; but involuntary? Yet the foods were present, and there was no one hindering.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">What power do I have to endure such great things? Therefore, it is not from strength that one endures, but from reverence and fear of God. For otherwise, he would have managed himself; but now he entrusts the matter to prayer and not to his own daring.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"My nearest ones did not regard me; like torrents departing, or like a wave, they passed by me."</i><sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And this also is a work of God's abandonment, to overlook even one's own kin suffering such things. For when He Himself withdraws, and a man is stripped of the help from God, all things are hostile and warlike. How then, he says, do you reproach one who has fallen into great misfortunes, and who is deprived of consolation from all outside, being grieved and tormented at how unexpectedly everything has turned against me?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Those who once showed reverence to me, now have fallen upon me."</i><sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Chrysostom and Polychronius. What, he says, do I mean by saying that those very close spit in contempt? They did indeed multiply the misfortunes, and these things happened a little earlier, even while trembling at my name.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"So that when you see my wound, be afraid."</i><sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">See, he says, that you do not demand punishment because of cruelty; even if nothing else, neither friendship, nor benefaction, nor anything else makes you more gentle, the very sight of my wounds ought to have filled you with much gentleness.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For what? Did I ask anything of you? Or do I need your strength, so that you might save me from enemies, or rescue me from the hand of tyrants?"</i><sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do not, he says, think that I have become burdensome to you in any way, that you have thus treated me without mercy. Or did I urge you to ally yourselves with me against my adversaries? Or did I implore you to comfort my poverty with a gift? But indeed, neither in the past did I ask anything of you, nor now, but you came of your own accord, as if having been invited. Why then do you undertake the works of enemies?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Teach me, and I will hold my peace; if I have erred in anything, show it to me."</i><sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">They did not have clear charges to bring forward, but merely relied on conjecture; that he indeed lived a virtuous life was evident, but they conjectured otherwise because of the punishments. "For not from you," he says—his vindication does not depend on their judgment.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I request strength; nor will your reproach with words stop me, for I will not endure your word's utterance. But since you attack an orphan, you assault your friend." I do not need, he says, your assistance; do not condescend to me, nor, as if wishing to fortify, speak words for the sake of favor, but convict me with boldness; for I do not fear your rebukes, nor will I keep silent at the word, since my conscience is clean, but even speaking against each word, I hope to prevail. However, I know this, that you so strike me with bitter insults, not considering the misfortune, not considering the friendship, as one truly forsaken of God's help; and neither misfortune nor friendship has softened you. But I, even if you set yourselves in opposition to me, will not refuse the struggle, but I will contend and proceed towards a defense; for I am conscious of nothing against myself.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Is not the life of man upon the earth a trial? And like a hired worker his life day by day? Or as a servant fearing his master, yet desiring the shadow? Or as a hired laborer awaiting his wages?"</i><sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Does it not seem to you, he says, that the life of all humans is filled with trials and circumstances? And that every person resembles a daily laborer who toils the whole day to receive a small wage? Or like a servant fearing his own master, and only ever rarely achieving a small rest? Or simply like a laborer, even if not daily, so that after many labors he receives some wages? Through these examples, he wishes to show the toilsome and brief nature of life. And he says, does it, therefore, only abound in toils, and not also in dangers? To me, it seems he speaks of a runaway servant, always in agony due to his flight; for this he indicates: the one who, having obtained a shadow, that is, considering things not present as present because of fear, and seeking darkness by which he will be covered. However, if life is a place of trials, how is it possible for the one being in trial not to fall into trial? Thus, it happens that these things are suffered not only from injustice, but also from nature itself, which I myself have endured.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Nights of pains have been given to me. If I sleep, I say, When shall it be day? And when I arise, again, When shall it be evening? I am filled with pains from evening until morning."</i><sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Did you see also the unbearable trial of the night, which itself was new and remarkable? For to all other men, although they suffer myriads, even though they dwell in prison, even if they are surrounded by chains, mourn misfortunes, endure bodily mutilation, are oppressed by poverty, disease, labors, and hardships, the night, coming upon them, brings a remedy of comfort, releasing the body from pains, relieving the soul from cares. But in the case of Job, the harbor became a reef, and the remedy became a sore, and the comfort was an addition of pain more severe, and the storm became more dreadful in that which offers calm to all men; and he fled as from waves from the day, on account of those intolerable pains, but found storms, and whirlpools, and hidden rocks, and reefs, as again to seek the waves in the day; and having the present weighty, he desired what was absent, hastening through the pains to run through the intervals of time. Therefore, even he, recounting this new suffering, cried out saying, "If I fall asleep, I say, When will it be day? If I arise, I say, When will it be evening?" For what reason, tell me? For during the day you naturally seek the night, as it provides rest from all the toils of the day; but having come into the night, with its peace and forgetfulness of those pains and of the cares, why again do you seek the day?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Tell me, the day? Because for me the night is more grievous than the day; for it offers me no cessation of labors, but rather an intensification, and troubles, and disturbances. And recounting this very thing, he said, "You terrify me with dreams, and dismay me with visions; indeed, I was terrified by this, seeing fearful visions in the night, and enduring unbearable fear, and much wonder, and astonishment; and what is given to others for rest was, for him, rather an intensification of misfortunes."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"My body is mingled with the decay of worms; and I melt clods of earth from the discharge as I scrape."</i><sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Through the expression, "I dissolve clods of earth," he indicates that, as it seems to me, he no longer suffered in his body like clay, but now he did this with the earth. Yet through all things, he instructs his friends regarding endurance and the repulsion of superficial understanding, because he suffers on account of sin, so that from the excessiveness of the pains they might perceive that he is not so wicked as to suffer such things. For it was necessary for them to reflect on their own circumstances and thus to understand the matters concerning Job. For incessant pains, and the discharge of bile, and worms together manifested endurance and courage.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"My life is lighter than speech. [And the rest have quickly wasted away.] I have perished in vain hope. [Symmachus: My days have been consumed, with no hope remaining.]"</i><sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Perhaps the phrase, "My life is lighter than talk," can indeed signify the transitory nature of life, as it is not standing firm but dissolving, just like talk. It can also denote the excessive pain, and that the toils have come to him unto death. The phrase, "Lighter than a runner," means that just as they—before coming to a halt—leap onward, so also does glory; before it arrives, it flies away. "My life has perished in empty hope," he says. Why? Because I have suffered hardship and received no reward; because amidst misfortunes, I have nothing good as an end. Then, leaving the conversation with friends, henceforth he turns to prayer, and he says:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For if a man descends into Hades, he will certainly not return, nor certainly will he turn back to his own house, nor certainly will his place recognize him anymore."</i><sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For this reason it is especially worthy to marvel at the righteous man, that, knowing nothing concerning the resurrection, he suffered indeed, but bore it nobly. For that he knew nothing clear about the mystery of the rebirth from the dead is evident from this: For to the one who once descended into Hades through death, it is no longer granted, having revived, to return to his own home; nor will there be any memory of this, once he becomes invisible from among the living; for it is not possible for the one who has died to rise again.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"I said that my bed will comfort me. [Symmachus writes, "will console."] But I will bring forth unto myself privately a word with my couch. [Theodotion writes, "My couch will sustain me in my meditation."] You terrify me with dreams and you frighten me with visions."</i><sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What occurred to the righteous man alone, this to no other; for neither did he have the comfort by night, but rather, an addition greater than the daytime terrors was the imagination of the nighttime fears. For that he endured more severe things in dreams, listen to what he says, "Why do you frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions?" What man of iron, what adamant, would endure such great terrors? For indeed, if each of these by itself is unbearable, consider, coming together, what great tumult it aroused. Nonetheless, he endured all these things, and in all that happened to him, he neither sinned nor with his lips; and this, having no interruption in the calamities, but also by night and day, being troubled by the sufferings. I cease to speak of the daytime terrors, but neither did the night provide him any relief; therefore he said, "You terrify me with visions," and said, "even the time for repose, when I expect briefly to converse with my thoughts and to obtain sleep and rest, terrible dreams stand before me." This occurs most naturally to those through the day afflicted and troubled in mind.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">To those being tempted, as indeed the wise Ecclesiastes said somewhere, “That a dream comes in a multitude of trials.” And it is likely that the devil, also showing certain terrifying phantoms, frightens him and disturbs him during sleep. But this blessed one, not yet confirmed that it was sought by the devil, believes that God is bringing these things and the torments upon him. Yet, in reality, this was also the work of the devil; for God brought nothing against him, but all was by the devil's hand.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"The Lord will not act unjustly in judging, will He? Or will He who made all things disturb justice?"</i><sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Chrysostom, Polychronius, and Olympiodorus. Do you not see, he says, how much justice is in creation, how much order? Is it possible for God to deliver a judgment against someone without discernment? Did the one who made all things with harmony and order, and brought forth the beginning with benevolence, disturb the fairness of justice only in your case, and wronged you against justice? Gently, then, he strikes the holy one, as according to justice, and enduring through sin, being of the same nature as the one who preceded him in discourse, for because of sins troubles are certainly sent. It ought to have been considered that such things happen not only to the wicked but also to the virtuous, for they are indifferent, and that the righteous one is more admirable, enduring tribulations and labors. But since he has nothing with which to accuse him of having sinned, he turns to his sons and says:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For inquire of the first generation, and investigate according to the lineage of the fathers; for we are but of yesterday and know nothing, for our life upon the earth is a shadow."</i><sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What he says is as follows: Since we are short-lived, let us ask the aged, and they will declare to us that just as it is impossible for grass to grow without moisture, so also it is impossible to remain in happiness without righteousness; and as it is not possible for the prosperity of the unjust to prevail; and as punishments are due to sins.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Responding then, Job says, "Truly I know that it is so.""</i><sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">How much philosophy is in these words: "I know," he says, "that the impious perish, but the righteous do not." Do you see how in no way does he accuse God of injustice?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"The one who does great and unsearchable things, glorious and marvelous, of which there is no number."</i><sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">These things which I have said beforehand, he says, are they not great, not unfathomable, even though they are visible? How much more the invisible things? Yet see, he does not speak of the essence anywhere, but of his energies. And why, he says, do I speak of each of them individually? For the works of God are great, incomprehensible, and countless.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Many are my wounds, He has made me empty."</i><sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This also God said to the devil concerning him, "But you said that to destroy his possessions is in vain; why then do you marvel, if what God said, this also he says, that it is in vain, not because he has sinned, but because there will be no gain from his punishment and his chastisement. 'For if I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with pure hands, you have dipped me enough in filth, and my garment has abhorred me.' Of Chrysostom and Olympiodorus. It was a custom among the ancients to cleanse pollutions with baths; and this also was an ancient custom, where they wished to show that they did not share in this sin, they washed their hands, 'I am innocent of this matter'; as also Pilate did concerning the Savior; and David sang, 'I will wash my hands among the innocent.' Therefore, this he says, that 'However I may be pure, those who see me consider me defiled.'</p>
        <p class="paragraph">These are severe accusations and the inflicted punishments, through preconceived notions, show me to be defiled and impure. So much so that even one touching my garments seems to be polluted because of the multitude of sins, each one supposing that these things happen to me. And he says these things because his friends, to prove him a sinner, attribute to him what has happened. What he says is this: "I am set as an example to all of impiety. Why then have I not died? For it would have been fitting for the wicked to be taken away from among men, so as not to be a teacher to others. Though I might become purer than the sun, I still bear a stain, not an incidental one. But even those so close as a garment to the body, they also have hated me, not because of the punishment, but as though unclean and defiled, they have turned away from me as if impure. My body also has become abominable to me, for this is the garment. And it can also be understood in this way, 'My garment has loathed me,' because even the clothing flees from me, as if having hated me, instead of, 'I cannot even dress myself, because I am overly afflicted.'"</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Because I renounce the works of your hands, but to the counsel of the ungodly you have paid attention."</i><sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">You see, that he does not wish to judge for this reason, as if acting rightly, but because, he says, this affliction benefits me; for I fear that it may also harm. For it is likely for some to suppose, either that you do not care for the men whom you have formed, or that the wicked are the ones who especially have favor with you, and their plans especially please you.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For you know that I have not acted impiously, but who is the one delivered from your hands?"</i><sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Of Chrysostom and Olympiodorus. And I know that I have not been impious, but it happens that I have acted impiously and am unaware; therefore, whenever you judge, no one can be justified. But even if I have not been impious according to my own opinion, I know that there is no escaping your counsel. Instead of saying, "Even if I am not conscious of it in myself, let your will prevail, which understands our circumstances better than we do."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Your hands have fashioned me and made me."</i><sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Chrysostom and Olympias: "I am the work," he says, "of Your hands, even if sinful." Do you see how he also recognizes God as Creator, and he implores Him to show mercy towards His own creation?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"After these things, having turned, you struck me. [Aquila and Theodotion: You drowned me round about at the same time.]"</i><sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Accordingly, knowing Him as the originator and Lord of both creation and providence, he turns the discourse into prayer, beseeching to be remembered of the frailty and shortness of nature, and that from the beginning He made it through goodness, and, having become angry, He punished with death, and he speaks.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Or did you not milk me like milk, and curdle me like cheese? Skin and flesh you clothed me with, and with bones and sinews you intertwined me; life and mercy you placed beside me, and your providence has guarded my spirit."</i><sup><a href="#fn92" id="ref92">92</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">The seed from which the living being is constituted is called milk that has been milked. And just as milk that has been milked becomes cheese, so also the seed, having trickled out and been compacted, becomes nature; and this is the first establishment of the embryo. For when the seed deposited in the furrows of the womb becomes compacted like cheese and solidifies, it becomes nature, which is then formed, or as Scripture says, is fashioned and receives a kind of character. And the liquid nature is congealed and is divided into skin, flesh, bones, and nerves. Such are these things in themselves, while the soul is present, it has a vital motion, but when it departs, it is left inactive. Not only, he says, did you place life with me, which signifies the essence of creation, but you also made mercy with me, through which your providential grace is manifested, and throughout all life I enjoyed your providence; for this is your visitation, which preserved my spirit, that is to say, even after being, your providence.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I possess to live; and simply, it declares the whole path and harmony of the body's constitution, both through those preceding and those presently set forth.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Say not, therefore, "I am pure in my works, and blameless before Him.""</i><sup><a href="#fn93" id="ref93">93</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And indeed he himself said, "Truly I know that there is no mortal clean before the Lord." You see how they accuse in opposition.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"But indeed inquire of the four-footed creatures if they might tell you; and the birds of heaven, if they might declare to you; relate it to the earth, if it might inform you, and the fish of the sea will recount to you. Who then among all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done these things? For is it not in His hand the soul of all living things, and the breath of every man? For the ear indeed discerns words, and the throat tastes food."</i><sup><a href="#fn94" id="ref94">94</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Of Chrysostom and Olympiodorus. Since they held in high regard, as possessing the knowledge of God, for this reason it is declared that all creation knows the Creator, and this is evident not only to humans but also to the irrational creatures and to the insensible earth itself. Why then, as if having spoken something great and marvelous, do you behave thus? For it is necessary that the wicked be destroyed, and no one is ignorant. In order to cause greater shame to Zophar, he said excessively, "Ask the irrational and inanimate things," which themselves declare the glory of God, appearing thus to speak, even if they do not speak; indeed they perceive the power of God, and if they receive a voice, they would say that God is the Creator of all things, and that His wisdom is unreachable, and He punishes the wicked, and that all things are under His hand, both the life of the living and death, and He is ready to do whatever He intends for each, and He holds together and maintains everything, both the soul of the irrational and the spirit of man. Therefore, if the irrational beings, if they could speak, would proclaim about God in this way, how much more indeed should man, who possesses innate reason, just as assuredly the throat discerns flavors and the ear discerns sounds. But some copies have "mind" instead of "ear"; it says then that just as we all have a throat for discerning foods, and it is common among humans to partake of food, so we have received a mind for the knowledge of God, capable of understanding the things of His wisdom and power; for the mind discerns intelligible things, while the senses discern sensible things; and it is common to us to know also the Creator, the God of all things.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"In much time, wisdom; and in much life, knowledge."</i><sup><a href="#fn95" id="ref95">95</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Chrysostom and Olympiodorus. It seems to me they are approaching them. "Do not think," he says, "that you have found everything. For even if we have a mind discerning, yet we still need much time to find it. For the prudent, as they age, stumble upon wisdom." And perhaps he wishes to say this, "And I know what I hear, and I received time towards knowledge." But Aquila and Symmachus, the one translates, "In the old is wisdom," while the other, "in those who have grown old," says, "among men, it is accomplished through toil, and is attained through time, but with God, by willing."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"If He demolishes, who will build? If He shuts against men, who will open?"</i><sup><a href="#fn96" id="ref96">96</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Gently, the righteous one teaches the discourse concerning Providence to those opposing him. For even if they posited Providence, nevertheless they fell into contradictions. He says, who has stood against His counsel? Indeed, it is possible to find one in poverty, another in distress, another afflicted by disease, and generally, in various circumstances.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">By the will of God, they occur, each one possessed differently, and no one able to repel what is determined. And the demonstration is from the greater and more agreed upon matters.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"If He withholds the water, He dries up the earth; but if He touches it, He destroys it, having overthrown it."</i><sup><a href="#fn97" id="ref97">97</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And if He withholds the rain, everything will perish by drought, as in the time of Elijah. And if He sends it down upon the earth, as in the days of Noah, it flooded and obliterated it. Then the reasonableness of the demonstration, that none of the things done by God could be achieved by another but Him alone, He teaches in what follows, saying:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"With Him is power and might; with Him is knowledge and understanding."</i><sup><a href="#fn98" id="ref98">98</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This means, to Him alone it belongs, to do all things according to His will; and this happens naturally, since being the Lord of all, He possesses unutterable power. To Him belong knowledge and understanding, the most accurate knowledge of beings, and the most wise governance.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Passing along captives of counsellors, and he made the judges of the earth to go astray."</i><sup><a href="#fn99" id="ref99">99</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Chrysostom and Polychronius. And these are works of Providence; for by the divine will and judgment, both counselors are led captive, and judges are removed. Perhaps he speaks not about those who become captives in war, but about those who think highly of themselves for their shrewdness; as if he were saying, "He deceives even the wise, and turns the discerning around, and those who propose what should be done to others, He reveals as senseless in His own precision, and leads them into indecision." This meaning is also presented by Aquila and Symmachus; for the former says, "leading away counselors as spoil," and the latter, "leading counselors into indecision." But see, that having shown the power of God to be invincible, he demonstrates it to be greater in wisdom than all; and he divides the discourse into those who are notable in life and those who are thought to be great in piety.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"May it be for you to be silent, and wisdom shall result for you."</i><sup><a href="#fn100" id="ref100">100</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Chrysostom and Olympias. For when someone utters things without reason, it is better to keep silent, and staying silent he will be wiser than speaking. For it is good for such people to be silent rather than engage in such words; their silence holds an assumption of wisdom. For one who makes himself silent will appear prudent; but chatter provokes the afflicted. You, therefore, O lover of God, do not waver in such words, but rather imitate the saints, knowing that these are satanic suggestions, and the one who works in those insulting is the devil, to draw you away from faith and cease your good purpose. For the crafty one knows that labor does not harm you, but rather commends you before God; but stopping the purpose, this greatly harms. Therefore, the more he tempts you, the more you advance in virtue; and the more he compels you to slight, the more you endure, and say, "All these things came upon us, and we did not forget you." If you thus strengthen yourself against the temptations, the devil will turn back in shame, and the Master of all will remember you, and will refresh you here doubly, and afterward you will hear, "Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many." Remember the patience of Job, who neither in prosperity nor in trial was overthrown, enduring steadfastly so much in each matter until he received double from God, and is still testified that he suffered, that he might appear just to all.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Keep silent, that I may speak, and let me be relieved of anger, having taken my flesh in my teeth."</i><sup><a href="#fn101" id="ref101">101</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For just as those who bite their own flesh in pains have a certain consolation, so also I find consolation in these things.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Speaking. Do you see that the words were not of one justifying himself, but rather some consolation of the pain was being restored to the body through the speech, and uplifting the soul?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Hear, hear my words; for I will declare with you listening."</i><sup><a href="#fn102" id="ref102">102</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">I wish to be judged, he says, I do not refuse the tribunal, and I know that I will not be condemned. Concerning the hearing of the things spoken by him, urging his friends to greater intercession, he doubles the entreaty; for he saw them being displeased by the reproofs, concerning which he says he will speak boldly without concealment while they listen. Therefore, the doubling of "Listen" either demonstrates their despondency or desires to bring about attention, so that they may certainly listen. For it sometimes happens that the hearing is struck by the voice, due to not applying the mind, thus failing to hear; wherefore also the Savior, awakening those listening to hear genuinely, would say: He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Because you have written against me evils and have placed upon me the sins of my youth."</i><sup><a href="#fn103" id="ref103">103</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And perhaps you revere me, being ignorant of the lowliness of my nature, because I am in no way different from a leaf or grass carried by the wind. For what reason, then, O Master, have you pronounced such a judgment against me? For "You have recorded evils against me," that is, you will afflict, a metaphor borrowed from kings, who pronounce judgment by decree. And "you oppose me," instead of, as if punishing an adversary. So that it might be said, "As the master with a rebellious servant, you determined the punishment against me by authority, for this is, 'You have recorded'; and thus he spoke, preserving what is fitting for the Master."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"As it grows old, like a wineskin."</i><sup><a href="#fn104" id="ref104">104</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Again, he speaks of the greatness of the disaster, again he mocks the lowliness of nature. Why then did he refer to a wineskin? Because the wineskin is empty, having only air; this is also a common saying among many, that "We are like an inflated wineskin." Do not, therefore, he says, look at the bulk, nor at the stretched skin, but consider what is inside, and you will see much emptiness.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">You see again the one fleeing to nature, and seeking to be released, not only because of the baseness, nor because of the brevity, nor because of being filled with despondency in life, but because it is not even possible to be pure.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For in time the sea becomes scant, and the river, having been deserted, is dried up; but a man, having fallen asleep, he will not arise until the heaven shall not be rolled together, and they shall not be awakened from their sleep."</i><sup><a href="#fn107" id="ref107">107</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Perhaps, just as in preceding matters, man was proven to be more swiftly dying than plants, so also here, he is of shorter duration than the sea and river; for neither the sea nor the river is interrupted, but man endures this. If only it were so that we might die and live again, but this is not the case. For the sea is depleted and then replenished, now increasing and now ceasing, rivers dry up and then flow again; but when a man dies, he does not return to life. And these matters are said regarding the spoken word. Allegorically, there is hope for a tree, as opposed to man. For if it is found in a fault, but repents and becomes in the soil of piety and on the rock, meaning faithful piety, from the water of rebirth or from the tear of repentance, it will sprout again; but he who dies in perversion and sin has no good hope. And in the time to come, sin is made to vanish, metaphorically named the sea; and the devil and his temptations dry up; and yet still those who die in sin have no such return.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Having passed away, they do not vanish away, as they await the resurrection.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"But Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: Shall a wise man give an answer with the spirit of understanding, and fill the belly with pain, reproving with words that ought not, and with speeches wherein there is no profit?"</i><sup><a href="#fn108" id="ref108">108</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Since he said, "My heart is with you," and, "I am not less intelligent than you," immediately he accuses him from these. "Behold," he says, "the wise man, claiming to know everything, such as how he responds." He filled distress of the stomach, that is, the words were spoken to him as consolation and are full of feeling. He speaks these reproachfully to Job, accusing him of two things: firstly, that the wise man does not exhibit wisdom demonstratively; secondly, "What you have spoken, as if correcting us, and as if suffering for the truth, and filling the stomach of the mind—this is what he means: He filled distress of the stomach—you spoke vainly and uselessly, and to no necessary end; neither of which the wise man does, but instead does all the opposite, and gives an intelligent response. And even if he suffers greatly for the truth as a zealot, and wishes to correct some, he does not produce futile words, and those which should not be, such as to fill distress of the stomach, nor does he speak bitterly, so as to fill the distress and burning of his own thoughts, which you have done."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Since Job said, "What are my sins? Teach me," on account of this Eliphaz reproaches him with a multitude of sins and says, "Know that compared to your sins, you have been punished lightly, and you have not received a penalty equal to your offenses." Then, since he has nothing to demonstrate as a sin of Job, he attempts to judge him from his words, saying:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"The death of the ungodly is a testimony."</i><sup><a href="#fn110" id="ref110">110</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">That is to say, a reproof, an accusation, a testament to other people, that thus all must suffer. And, he says, it is nothing remarkable; for pitiable is the end of all the ungodly, that is, their death is a demonstration of people's impiety, and this disgraceful end will reveal their affairs. For just as prosperity was set as a sign of righteousness, so too adversity as a mark of wickedness. Or the death of an ungodly person is a testimony, that is, evident, manifest, known to no one. But if you wish, understand it in this way as well: that the fulfillment of vice produces death, not the common one, but the one of punishment.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Olympius and Chrysostom. It is not enough, he says, that I am punished, but I also seem to be foolish; for the punishment has utterly wrecked me, and it has cut me down, and it has consumed me, so that I seem almost to be on the verge of madness, and outside the bounds of natural understanding. Or perhaps he means that God has allowed my friends to suppose concerning me that I am insensible in misfortunes; for he used "foolish" here instead of "insensitive." Therefore, he joined to this the idea of being "wasted away," because those who are wasted away in their limbs have lost sensation.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"May my supplication come before the Lord, and before Him let my eye shed tears."</i><sup><a href="#fn112" id="ref112">112</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Almost he says, "Let God hear these things, let God see these things, having nodded assent to my supplications, and having shown mercy to my tears, let Him rise to judge me as having suffered unjustly." But also this result happened for you, illustrious one; for the great arbiter beheld your struggles and listened to your supplication, looking upon your precious tears.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Tears, therefore, he assured the cause of the struggles. And the shedding of tears before the Lord happens to those who weep blessedly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"But Job, answering, says: "How long will you make my soul weary?""</i><sup><a href="#fn113" id="ref113">113</a></sup></span></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Much is the experience of the devil. Those who were left behind by his own made the calamity worse than those who departed; for those indeed no longer acted, but these both reproached him, and disobeyed, and spoke against him, and did the remaining things which he incited.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Those who saw me abhorred me; those indeed whom I loved rose up against me."</i><sup><a href="#fn116" id="ref116">116</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Fugitive, he says, have I become by those formerly conversing, and enemies I had those formerly loving; for both my companions, seeing me advancing and in need of their consolation, fled as if from an aversion; and those once close, and needing help from me, and indeed even having been benefited by me, contrived evils for me. Such a thing also David sings: "They set against me evils instead of goods, and hatred instead of my love."</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"To raise up my skin that endures these things."</i><sup><a href="#fn118" id="ref118">118</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Would that, he says, God might raise again my skin which has endured these things. From this we learn an ecclesiastical doctrine, that the body which endures trials and torments will itself rise with the soul, so that it might also jointly enjoy; therefore he said, that which suffers these things. For it is not just that one thing suffers and another rises. Thus he knew, as it seems to me, about the resurrection and the resurrection of bodies, unless someone says that the resurrection is the release from the dire afflictions seizing him. And fittingly, he places a reasonable cause for the change. He says, He himself struck, He himself will also heal, and He who has enveloped with dreadful things will also reveal as pure from sufferings even this wretched body; for once, at some point, releasing from the manifold suffering, He would grant respite from the labors lying upon it. However, Theodotion, having rendered, My redeemer lives, and shall rise last upon the earth, persuades to join the two lines and thus read: For I know that He who is about to release me on earth is eternal, to raise again my skin which has suffered these things. This is the meaning: God is immortal, of whom we are offspring; having dissolved me onto the earth through death, again He will raise me from the earth through the resurrection; or having released me from the disease, that is, having liberated me, He will renew again my skin corrupted by the sores; for He indeed causes to suffer, and again restores, He puts to death and makes alive. Therefore, he adds.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"The joy of the ungodly is an extraordinary downfall, and the delight of the lawless is destruction."</i><sup><a href="#fn119" id="ref119">119</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">If, then, their joy is an exceptional downfall and their delight a destruction, where shall we place the destruction, tell me, where the pain and the despondency?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"May his sons perish, the lesser ones, and may his hands kindle pains."</i><sup><a href="#fn120" id="ref120">120</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And from this, indeed, it is clear that the wound is inflicted by God, because the lesser prevail over the greater, and those who are cast aside overcome those who possess strength. Instead of "Let them extinguish the pains," Aquila says, "They will return," and Symmachus says, "They will cause."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Why do the ungodly live, grow old, and in wealth?"</i><sup><a href="#fn121" id="ref121">121</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Such a thing also David sings: Behold, these sinners prosper and have seized wealth forever. And now Job says, It is not only this, that one must marvel that they receive such recompenses for their wickedness, but also that prosperity itself makes them worse.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Or by making your word will you reprove, and will it enter with you into judgment?"</i><sup><a href="#fn122" id="ref122">122</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Thus, He is so compassionate that, even while judging us, He permits us to speak to Him as if He is being judged with us concerning the matters we desire. Indeed, He says in Isaiah: "Come, let us reason together." The phrase "let us reason together" means this: If you have anything to accuse Me of, as if I have not done what is proper, speak; and I, saying whatever I may have, will convince you by condemning you that you are worthy to be condemned.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Who then would know, that I might find Him and come to the end? [Symmachus: Until His seat.] And I would declare my judgment myself; [Symmachus again: I will set before Him a judgment.] And my mouth to be filled with reproofs, and I would know the remedies that He will speak to me. [Symmachus: Words.] And I would perceive what He would announce to me, and with great strength He will come upon me. [Symmachus: He will contend with me.] Then He will not use threats against me. [Symmachus: Only He shall not impose upon me.] For truth and reproof are with Him; He would bring forth my judgment to the end."</i><sup><a href="#fn123" id="ref123">123</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What is gathered from the text is this: Who then would give me God listening to me and responding to me? For He would justify me. In detail, it says: If only it were possible, he says, to find God; if only it were possible to come near to the divine throne, and to stand before Him, and to encounter Him, and to be judged, and to receive the decision from there; if only, having stood before that divine judgment seat, I could set forth all my sufferings, and speak of the life I have lived; so that, speaking before Him, both what I have done and what I have suffered, I might learn by experience what judgment He renders, and what remedy He speaks concerning my perplexity; and whether He might proceed severely, punishing more harshly, or relax His threat. For even if He will deal with me with great might and threat, nevertheless I know that truth is with Him, and without partiality He conducts judgments, that is, examinations; and I am persuaded that if I had met Him, I would have received a verdict in my favor, against you. For “In the end” means “completed”; for among the Hebrews, the end and victory are signified by one word; thus, in some of the Psalms, instead of “In the end,” to the victor it is inscribed.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">To the victor, it is inscribed. Therefore, he says, I wished to learn what God was going to say to me and if He would similarly punish me. He says these things not as one accusing God of injustice, but as one reproving friends who do not have a sound understanding concerning Him. Do you see how he achieved what he prayed for? For this became the last in the book, and he attained divine conversation and response.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"If indeed he himself judged thus, who is the one contradicting him? For he himself willed, and he made."</i><sup><a href="#fn124" id="ref124">124</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">He knows, he says, my way, and that I have always been eager to obey Him; but who, when He judges, will contradict Him? For what I am conscious of within myself, these are the things; yet let the decision that seems right to God prevail, and let no one oppose His judgments. For even if He has condemned me while acting rightly, and has judged me to suffer these things, who could speak against it? Indeed, absolutely no one; for His will is accompanied by power, and what seems good to Him is accomplished. Do not demand explanations from me about divine providence; one thing I know, that I am aware of nothing against myself. If I am examined in harsh circumstances, I do not question the administration of God, but, not knowing the reason, I say that He has done what He wished, and bowing down, I worship, not meddling further.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"At this, I will be troubled before his presence,  
I will consider, and I will be terrified by him."</i><sup><a href="#fn125" id="ref125">125</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">I have not sinned, he says; and what of this? For it is not only on account of sins that it is possible for God to punish, but also apart from these.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"The Lord softened my heart, and the Almighty hastened me; for I did not know that darkness would come upon me, and before my face He covered gloom."</i><sup><a href="#fn126" id="ref126">126</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Not according to human sequence, he says, has this happened; unexpected is the evil. I suspect the hand of God to be the blow. And rightly he said, "Before my face"; for the darkness is not common, but of my despondency.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Answering then Bildad the Shuhite, he says: "What indeed is the prelude or fear from him?""</i><sup><a href="#fn127" id="ref127">127</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">From here I shall begin, he says, of the discourse, and I will introduce. Everything is full of fear and trembling, and there is no one who will be able to escape that hand. Indeed, as Job has said: Who then would know that I should go to him? he says, because before all else even the mentioning of God is terrifying.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"How indeed shall a mortal be just before the Lord? Or who could purify him, born of a woman?"</i><sup><a href="#fn128" id="ref128">128</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For Job said: I desired to come to trial, and, that Even if I have not sinned, yet I am punished; in response to this, he again says that There is no one righteous among men, nor entirely pure, so you excessively seek judgment and examination.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Then Job, answering, says: "To whom do you belong, or whom do you intend to help? Is it not the one who has great strength, and to whom the mighty arm belongs?""</i><sup><a href="#fn129" id="ref129">129</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Neither do I, he says, accuse you for taking the part of God; for indeed it was necessary thus; however, it was not proper for you to condemn me. For indeed, it is possible to speak on behalf of God, and not to allow such a thing to become subject to accusations. Having said these things to him jestingly, as one desiring to appear a more novel advocate of God, about whom all have a high regard as wise and capable, he turns the discourse upon the power of God, showing how it is better for him to glorify the matters concerning the strength of God, and he says:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"He appointed order for the darkness, and every end He Himself examines thoroughly."</i><sup><a href="#fn130" id="ref130">130</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">He spoke well: He assigned order to darkness, showing that He knows how to yield and withdraw. Who dispels that gloom? Whence such order in such a matter? Then he describes His power, then His wisdom, persuading not to desire to demand accountability from Him. For of all things, he says, the ends and outcomes are wisely determined by God, encompassing all with His incomprehensible providence. Therefore, neither the punishments against the ungodly are neglected in vain nor applied without purpose by Him who arranges all with measure, and order, and harmony.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"He said to man, "Behold, reverence for God is wisdom, and to depart from evils is understanding.""</i><sup><a href="#fn131" id="ref131">131</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This is the greatest wisdom, to be pious, not to meddle and demand accountability for what happens. Nothing is equal to this art, nothing more powerful than this wisdom, nothing better than piety.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For I delivered the poor from the hand of the powerful, and I helped the orphan who had no helper."</i><sup><a href="#fn132" id="ref132">132</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But first, having entrusted his oversight and his guardianship to God, then he boasts in the Lord. Observe him, not thinking highly of himself on account of abstaining from evils, nor on account of sacrifices, as the Jews do, but on account of that which God desires. For, he says, "Judge for the orphan, and justify the widow;" and regarding the doing of good deeds, "For I have delivered the poor," he says, "and helped the orphan."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"May the blessing of the one perishing come upon me; but Symmachus [translates it as] attained. And the mouth of the widow blessed me."</i><sup><a href="#fn133" id="ref133">133</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Know then that somehow the race of widows is ungrateful, not according to their own nature, nor choice, but because of the compulsion of poverty; for it is a furnace of poverty. And it is a difficult thing to praise the one doing good; yet even these blessed Job. And his noble deeds are recorded so that we might emulate them.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And I was clothed with righteousness, and I put on judgment like a cloak."</i><sup><a href="#fn134" id="ref134">134</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Rightly then, after saying, "I saved the poor from the hand of the mighty," he adds, "I was clothed with righteousness." For there are those who preside over others but often do injustice themselves; yet not so with him. But, he says, "I dressed myself in judgment, thus I adorned myself." Indeed, others find the matter troublesome, they are indignant, considering it burdensome and heavy, but not I, he says. Rather, just as someone would adorn themselves with a double cloak, so I in the fair judgment, not today and none tomorrow, but just as it is necessary to have garments always, so too the vindication of the powerless. But who appointed him as judge? He became a self-appointed judge by virtue of virtue itself, just like Moses; such should be the rulers. You saw him in trials, as much as it was possible for you to see (for neither does the word itself have the power to present the exactness; for pain, and torments, and the tyranny of despondency, and the disturbance arising from so many hardships, no power of speech can interpret to the hearers as much as the experience of the matters themselves). Come, I will show him to you again; for this too is no small thing, but indeed requiring a very philosophical soul, demonstrating much philosophy in wealth and prosperity. Who then was he, being rich? A common harbor for all, a common father for all, a common physician, or rather greater than a physician. Listen then to him speaking.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"I was the eye of the blind, and a foot to the lame."</i><sup><a href="#fn135" id="ref135">135</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">You see how he is greater than a physician; instead of nature, he was made for those who were crippled, and what they could not achieve by their own nature.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Through skill he corrected, these things he himself obtained through encouragement, becoming to them instead of limbs due to the great care for them; for as if healthy, and with complete feet, and seeing, thus were those disposed who had been deprived of these limbs, not perceiving their lameness, nor their maiming, through his great care. Therefore, he did not say, "I comforted the lame and the blind," he did not say, "I alleviated the misfortune," nor "I removed the perception of the mutilation," but, "I was their eye, they saw through me, they did not experience the trial of their own misfortune through me, they did not seek those who would lead them by hand, those who would guide them. Everywhere I made darkness light for them. Behold apostolic signs: I was the eye for the blind, not giving sight (for that grace was not yet), but making them not even perceive the misfortune; yet now, those who can see, they make blind. He did not say, 'Through servants I acted,' but, 'I myself corrected the errors of nature, not only those errors by humans, but also those by nature itself; for the missing limbs of the body I supplemented to those in need with the provision of necessities and with great foresight. Regarding the mind, he opened blind understandings, and assisted those whose souls were maimed, and himself became their eye; he granted feet to those lame, the foundations of the soul, and became their foot through the word, and he guided them both. The eye refers to intellectual guidance, and the foot, to moral guidance."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"I was the father of the powerless."</i><sup><a href="#fn136" id="ref136">136</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Not even here did He say, "I comfort the orphans," but rather, "I did not allow the feeling of orphanhood to come about, nor for the dread to appear." Just as there, He supplied the deficiency with the abundance of providence, taking away even the awareness of the terrible things from those suffering such afflictions. In these matters, voices are made manifest, showing the benefit to the powerless, the weak. But observe after how much time He says these things.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Justice which I did not know, I investigated."</i><sup><a href="#fn137" id="ref137">137</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This is much more than a judge: for those who judge sit awaiting the wronged, and after the supplication from them, then those most worthy of the judges provide their support; in contrast, many do not even do this. But he surpassed even the most worthy, and far exceeded from much difference; for he did not wait for the wronged to come to him, nor did he act after their supplication, but anticipating, he went around seeking those who were wronged; and not simply seeking, but with much vigilance, with much care. And this you will clearly understand, having learned the force of the expression; for he did not say, "I sought," but, "Justice which I did not know, I searched out, I investigated, I accomplished, I persisted in being inquisitive, moving everything, so as to find if anywhere someone wronged might be hidden." You see the protection, not up to funds, nor up to food and clothing, but even up to the dangers of another's judgment he undertook.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"From the midst of their teeth, I snatched prey."</i><sup><a href="#fn138" id="ref138">138</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Observe the difficulty of the matter. "Having already been swallowed and preoccupied," he says, "I have set right the situation; for I did not abandon hope, nor did I give up, even if the matter was already preoccupied, but I recovered even what was swallowed." He demonstrates the prudent care of an excellent and sober shepherd for his fellow servants, rescuing, as it is said, from the mouth of the lion, legs of a sheep and lobes of ears.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"They became exceedingly joyful whenever I spoke to them; just as the thirsty ground awaits the rain, so they did my speech."</i><sup><a href="#fn139" id="ref139">139</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">See what he says: It was not wealth that made him envied, nor the advancement of the wronged, nor anything else of the sort; rather, everyone listened to him gladly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Now they admonish me in turn, whose fathers I disdained; whom I did not deem worthy of the dogs of my pasture."</i><sup><a href="#fn140" id="ref140">140</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">He said they were despised; not using the despising boastfully, but clearly knowing them to be wicked, in accordance with: The wicked one is despised before him; for he considered such ones as nothing. And the phrase: They admonish me in part, as regards myself, not because they deposited a portion of beneficence, but since he himself admonished others, now these admonish him; for this reason it is thus spoken. And regarding them being not worthy to be dogs, it is not because they are worse than this barking animal, but because he did not judge them worthy even to kennel the dogs. For, he says, I did not consider them worthy to lead the dogs of my flock. He indeed rejected their admonition, as having neither reverence from age nor from virtue. For, he says, who were admonishing? whom? The younger admonishing the superior; the base one admonishing him who is not such; the lowly and obscure, the one once bright and distinguished. In what follows and successively, he also hints at their weakness, saying:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"But I wept over every helpless one; I groaned seeing a man in distress. And I, holding fast to good things, behold, days of evils have rather met me."</i><sup><a href="#fn141" id="ref141">141</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Although being in wealth, I did not do anything of the sort, nor did I rejoice in the misfortunes of others, which is what I now suffer, finding many rejoicing at my own misfortunes. Quite the opposite, I both wept and sighed. And this is not a small thing, beloved, to have a sympathetic disposition. But I, the one who was expecting good things, days of evils have met me, thus accept that, because I was anticipating good things through my sympathy towards others, the opposite of my hopes has occurred to me. Thus also Symmachus rendered it; I was expecting good things, but evils came.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"I made a covenant with my eyes, and I will not consider a virgin."</i><sup><a href="#fn142" id="ref142">142</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Symmachus said, "And I have not conceived anything concerning a virgin." Job kept evangelical precision; for those things which Christ, coming later, commanded, he perfected through deeds. And since he who looks to desire has already committed adultery, he instructs the eye not to curious hours concerning the virgins. What might they say who have their spiritual partners, affirming that they cohabit with them dispassionately and are not harmed? Yet even if this were, it is necessary to spare those who are scandalized; for suppose you, cohabiting with a virgin, are pure of all evil passion, yet you harm others who are weaker. And yet the blessed Job did not dare to bear witness to himself of such power and philosophy; but having attained every virtue, and having surpassed all of the devil's snares, and first and alone having demonstrated such endurance, and having surpassed by temperance of soul all iron and adamant, and having shattered the devil's power, thus feared such a struggle, and deemed it impossible to dwell with a virgin and remain unscathed and pure. So as not only to place himself far and distant from such cohabitation, but also from the sight formed merely from encounter, and he imposed a law upon his own eyes, simply not to look upon a virgin. "For I made a covenant with my eyes," he says, "and I will not look upon a virgin," that is to say, "I will not notice, I will not see." For he knew, he knew clearly, that not only is it difficult but perhaps even impossible for one who looks curiously upon a virginal sight to escape the harm from there. If, however, he cannot, let him avoid the sight.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Small for you towards competition is Job, although indeed we are not even worthy of his dung. However, if you consider the example to be lesser than your magnanimity, contemplate the blessed Paul, who after refined philosophy disciplines his body and enslaves it, and exhibits a life of contest. For this reason, Christ also, declaring the difficulty of the matter, did not even permit a simple glance at the looks of women, but even with the penalty of adulterers, he threatened to punish those who look in such a way. And he did not legislate celibacy but, indicating the nature of the matter, he said: "He who can accept this, let him accept it."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"The powerless, however, did not fail the need which they once had."</i><sup><a href="#fn143" id="ref143">143</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do you see how he was not arrogant, how moderate, how a healer common to all, and a common harbor, and a common refuge for those in need? Whenever they had need, he says, it was not the case that some he helped and others not, but whatsoever the need was, even if it was full of dangers, even if it was costly, even if it was precarious. And observe, he assisted those from whom he expected nothing in return: widows, and orphans, and the powerless.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For the fear of the Lord held me fast, and from His decree I will not pass."</i><sup><a href="#fn144" id="ref144">144</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But such indeed is the compassion of the just man; what might one say about the disdain for wealth? For this also was accomplished by him with exceptional measure; for not only did he not covet the possessions of others, as most do now, but he did not even cling to his own, but estranged himself from them with extreme intensity; therefore he also said:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"If I have set gold as my dust [but Symmachus, My confidence], or if I have trusted in a precious stone, or if I have rejoiced because much wealth became mine."</i><sup><a href="#fn145" id="ref145">145</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Because of this, even having been deprived, he bore it with much ease; and while having resources, he practiced abundant almsgiving; for he pursued every virtue; and although possessing nothing, he was disposed more precisely, having been endowed with so much; for not even he who has nothing has been freed from wealth as much as that man, who has so much; for everywhere it is the intention that is crowned.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"If indeed upon numberless things I placed my hand."</i><sup><a href="#fn146" id="ref146">146</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Because, indeed, not even with good things being present did Job strongly hold to them, listen to what he says: "But even if I rejoiced when much wealth came to me." What do you say, man? Were you not rejoicing at the wealth flowing in? Not at all, he says. Why not? Because I knew its instability and transience; I knew that the possession was not permanent.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Or do we not see the sun shining forth, failing, and the moon waning? For it is not in their power."</i><sup><a href="#fn147" id="ref147">147</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What he says is such as this: If the stars in heaven, shining continuously, undergo some change, the sun indeed being eclipsed, and the moon waning, how is it not of utmost folly to believe that earthly things are permanent and fixed? For this reason, he neither rejoiced in present things nor grieved over those departed, since he well knew their nature. This bright light perishes, becomes invisible, and is not seen. Do you see what kind of cause he says is the change of the luminaries? Thus, creation suffices for us even for philosophy, not only for the knowledge of God. When you see that the sun is great, marvel at the creator; when you see that it is eclipsed, understand the perishability of human affairs. For if that which is the brightest of all upon the earth, as he says, diminishes and ceases, how much more all the other things; if that which is so useful and necessary, and without which it is not possible to live, undergoes change, much more so the superfluous, and those not necessarily set before us.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"But even if my maidservants often said, "Who would give us to be satisfied with his flesh, since he is exceedingly kind to me?""</i><sup><a href="#fn148" id="ref148">148</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Was he then humble, yet not also desirable and admirable? Consider here also the surpassing excellence; for just as in adversity he endured the imposed trials with all intensity, so also in prosperity he achieved each virtue with great abundance, not simply or casually, but reaching the very summit. Thus he was gentle, not only towards others.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But he was also shown toward the servants; for from this comes all gentleness, whenever someone is humane toward the one who is subordinate, and not violent. The servants used to say, "Who would grant us to be filled with his flesh?" Here he narrates the passionate love of the servants which they had for him, having become ardent lovers of him due to what he demonstrated toward them. For thus, he says, they hung upon me, thus they held fast, thus they were attached, thus they were loving, to the extent of desiring to be filled with my flesh [to devour and consume], because they loved exceedingly and were inflamed; thus I was so very kind and sweet to the maidservants, that if it were possible even of my flesh to be filled, they would have done this gladly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"But outside the stranger did not lodge; my door was open to every traveler who came."</i><sup><a href="#fn149" id="ref149">149</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This is the hallmark of hospitality and Abrahamic nobility. "I held in common," he says, "the house, the table," not considering my own things as mine, but as the Lord's. The Lord has given; therefore let the measure of food be distributed to the fellow servants. You saw the humility, you saw the philanthropy, you saw the benevolence, you saw the generosity, that it was a common good, extending the right hand to all and opening the house. For he did not act like those who, many in number, are busybodies and meddlesome towards those receiving, but rather, "My door," he says, "was open to everyone, and no one lodged outside."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"If indeed I have sinned unwillingly, I hid my sin; for I was not intimidated by the throng of the multitude, so as not to declare it before them."</i><sup><a href="#fn150" id="ref150">150</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Speak first your sins, so that you may be justified. Regarding the accomplishments, he says, I made no one a witness, but concerning the faults I wished all to be aware; therefore, I was not ashamed to confess my own fault before the crowds of the city.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And if I have left my door impossible to go out with an empty bosom; who would hear from me?"</i><sup><a href="#fn151" id="ref151">151</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What he says is this: If I ignored the one in need, let no one listen to me. Notice, he did not say, “I gave to the one who came,” but rather, “I did not even refuse the one who was unwilling.” He urged even those who willingly desired him to bypass them. For he knew the matter, that it is prosperity. Thus, as much eagerness as the poor showed by earnestly pestering those who could extend a hand, so much did he apply by earnestly pestering those who ought to fare well, and he did not allow them to leave with an empty bosom. For he not only cared for them by receiving them as guests, but alongside feeding them, he also provided provisions for the poverty that followed, abundantly and cheerfully.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"But Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said: I am younger in age, and you are elders; therefore, I kept silent, fearing to declare to you my own understanding."</i><sup><a href="#fn152" id="ref152">152</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">On either side of him, then, we conjecture his understanding, both from his silence and from his speech. For lest anyone say, "And why did he not from the beginning contend with us for God?" he resorted to his age and says, "Expecting something noble and marvelous to be spoken by you, I remained quiet." See how free from ambition he was, how he yielded the precedence to them.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And behold, there was not for Job one who reproved, responding to his words from among you."</i><sup><a href="#fn153" id="ref153">153</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Or then he says this, that neither at that time when you rebuked him did you rebuke as you ought, nor that later you remained silent. In any case, he says, you could not say that we acted wisely in this, that we have been added to the portion of God and took up the arguments on His behalf. For you erred no less, both in that you were not able to rebuke Job, and in that you tolerated him speaking such things, so that even this is foolish on your part. And you cannot say that you found grace and wisdom from God, as advocating for him; for you have been defeated by Job.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"They were dismayed, they did not answer yet;  
they wrested words from them; I awaited; for I did not speak, because they stood, they did not answer."</i><sup><a href="#fn154" id="ref154">154</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Some say that these two lines are not from Elihu, but from the author himself, inserted between as a silence of the friends; I, however, assert that these also belong to Elihu, and there is here a figure of speech called apostrophe. For he, as if conversing with another in the meantime, speaks concerning them, saying, “For this reason I speak,” since they were astounded by Job’s words, and their own words were shown to be old, rotten, and useless through their silence. Hence he also adds, “But I waited and did not speak, thinking they could rebut; but when they stood and could not proceed further, being checked by the words of Job, I passed on to refute the things said.”</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Here it is shown that long ago Elihu, struggling to speak, endured and persisted, and was on the verge of bursting forth, thus requiring much patience. This is especially the work of wisdom: to be able to restrain words.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Being slandered by a multitude, they shall cry out; they shall call for help from the arm of many. And he did not say, Where is God, who made me, who appoints night watches?"</i><sup><a href="#fn156" id="ref156">156</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Chrysostom and Origen. Or do you not see, just as in a military camp, all things arranged, and with greater precision each remaining in its proper order, none of the whole exceeding its proper limit, nor leaping into territories not their own? At least, while men sleep, no one plots; when the beasts traverse, then they sleep. But observe that Job articulates praises and hymns of God, saying about Him, "He who assigns night watches." Do you wish to see how God assigns night watches? This entire age is night, it is darkness; the light is reserved for you; for now you see through a mirror, but you will one day see the light. Therefore, the whole age is night, and there is need for guards appointed for this night, so that the guards, those over the nights, may protect those in the night from robbers, from beasts, from enemies. Who are the guards? The angels who encamp.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Be judged, then, before him, if you are able to praise him, as he is even now."</i><sup><a href="#fn157" id="ref157">157</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Olympias and Chrysostom,

"Consider," he says, "the worth of God, if the reason could encompass the hymn. Why then do you wish to be judged against such a great and mighty one, where indeed you are not even able to hymn him worthy of his worthiness? And these things, for which now you are being punished. For if he sat in judgment," he says, "and set forth the laws, you would not have praised him, nor glorified him worthily regarding the things now happening to you, when you believe yourself to be wronged and punished. For not being able to hymn God worthily is no great thing; but to be about to be judged by him, in matters concerning us, and to not be able to hymn him worthily, this is great."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"After Elihu ceased speaking, the Lord spoke to Job out of the whirlwind and the clouds."</i><sup><a href="#fn158" id="ref158">158</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Since a cloud is a symbol of heaven, as if wishing to bring heaven itself to Job, in a manner of speaking, He brought His throne near to him, so as to stand upon it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Translate from Greek to English: "his mind, and to persuade that this voice is borne from above, just as in the case of the mercy seat of the ark; this seems to me to have happened also on the mountain, when the cloud overshadowed, so that they might learn that the voice is from above."</p>

[Symmachus, Dark in understanding,] holding words in heart, and does he think to hide from me?"</i><sup><a href="#fn159" id="ref159">159</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Observe what he does: From these words, it seems to me, to the one contemplating them, that a different intention enters his mind. For since there were many things that Job held in his mind and he did not dare to bring them forth openly, he begins by raising him up from this first one, and shows that he foresees human matters and knows all things clearly; hence, he starts from those previous things, which are more inexcusable. For if what he dared to say was so burdensome and grievous, much more so were those things. For this reason, he applies the remedy to them first: "Who is this?" he says. Simultaneously, from the beginning, he shows the essence of God, as if saying: "Who is attempting to hide from me, tell me, from the one who knows mysteries accurately? For because you did not say them, are they not words?" A word was born and came into being; therefore, in vain you wish to hide what cannot be concealed. Do you see how gently, how instructively and reprovingly he speaks?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Gird your loins like a man; and I will ask you, and you shall answer me."</i><sup><a href="#fn160" id="ref160">160</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Since he was overwhelmed by despondency, he rouses him through words, so as to pay attention to what is spoken. And he advances the discourse by questioning, which is most persuasive in examination. And he shows that he does all things with wisdom and understanding, and it was not fitting for him, who accomplished so much with wisdom, to overlook—a man for whom he crafted everything—suffering unjustly as it happened. We learn secret mysteries indeed; and what was spoken to Job was not spoken to him more than to us: "Gird up your loins like a man." For we, too, need this eagerness and revival.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">What do you say, he says? Did I establish the earth with such precision for your sake, and shall I disregard you for whom I made it? For this reason, he does not speak of the wisdom of creation, nor of the craftsmanship according to its construction, but abundantly from the earth, from the heavens showing that if the world enjoys such providence for your sake, how much more should you? He did not say, "When I made," but "When I founded;" for even causing it to stand was a work of great skill, having no foundation, nor base, nor support, yet to fit together such a great mass and fix it so firmly, so that in such a length of time it is not shaken.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, the earth has not come to be so vast without purpose, nor by chance; but it seems to me, even if something additional has been added by chance, it is untimely, and if likewise something has been subtracted according to reason, it spoils the whole.

And did you adorn him by word, as I did? And did you show forth the adornment of the world? Whence it is evident that other creatures did not have reason; for otherwise, it would not have been uniquely attributed to man. For the living being capable of speech, he says, is rational. And the phrase "To be set upon the earth" signifies to be appointed to rule over all that is upon the earth.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">As for me, I marvel at God for both these reasons: that He made the human body mortal, and that within its decay, He demonstrated His own power and wisdom. For the baseness of the substance most clearly shows the resourcefulness and skill of the art; because in clay and ashes He has placed such harmony, and such sensations, so varied and manifold, and such faculties capable of philosophizing. And indeed from earth, the material from which only pots and bricks are made, He succeeded in making an eye so beautiful, and endowing it with such power, that with the perception of a small pupil, it can see and encompass so many bodies.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Chrysostomos and Olympiodoros. He calls them treasures, not because they are stored away, but because he can display them readily, as if he were bringing them forth from treasures, showing them whenever he wants. "Do you know," he says, "how I prepare the snow and hail that do not appear to manifest? Or are you able to use these against enemies, which I am capable of doing?" You see that he desires to show this opportune timing, indicating that it happens at the right moment, and not just simply; for he has employed the snow and hail against enemies, and whenever he wishes to punish certain individuals. Then he goes on concerning all the other things, I mean, concerning rains, frost, and winds.</p>

Enumerating the creation of heaven and earth, and the bounds of the sea, and the positioning of the stars, and the flow of rain, and other things by which He governs our life, who, it is said, has taught women, though otherwise weak, to be skilled in the preparation of textiles, and in the embellishment of these with the dyes and colors of wool? The divine Scripture mixes small things with great, and admires the wisdom of women in weaving, saying, who has given to women the wisdom of weaving and the skill of embroidery? Of such a rational and exceptional creature this wisdom is, one that journeys even to the heavens; for this wisdom is not commonplace, being manifold, nor is its use small. Therefore, the artistry concerning the looms is not neglected, nor is it dismissed as excessive, but even in these is divine wisdom, which God is not ashamed to call His own, not saying there is another giver and supplier of this, but Himself.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Well did he say, "You have preserved;" for since the creature is always in flight, and in fear and discouragement, always leaping and bounding about, how, he says, does it not become weakened, but the birth comes forth complete? The phrase, "You have loosened their birth pangs," has been stated emphatically; for they give birth automatically, not needing midwifery. And the phrase, "You have reared their children without fear," is more clearly expressed by Theodotion.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">He interpreted, saying: If they give their children, will you save them? But, Will you send away their pangs? If you understand their pangs as the suffering, the "will you send away" is taken instead of "will you cease." For, he says, you will cease the pangs. The things that were brought forth with pain and put aside you will reclaim; the "will you send away" indicates "you will send them forth," which Symmachus also hinted at by rendering: "They leave behind what they have brought forth in pain." For after raising the newborns, they allow them to go wherever it pleases them. This understanding is also presented by the following line.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">He turns the discourse to the most useful topics, mentioning the tame horse, and speaks at length about this animal: how proud it is, how it stands upright, how it is suitable for war, how capable it is of saving a man. You see each proud one, both the donkey and this one; but the former is submissive, the latter is not.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"You shall not believe until the trumpet shall sound."</i><sup><a href="#fn173" id="ref173">173</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">He hears, he says, the trumpet and knows the signal of war, and from afar cries out the warlike shout.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"From your wisdom, the hawk stands, having spread its wings, unmoving, gazing towards the South."</i><sup><a href="#fn174" id="ref174">174</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">See how much he says with a few words. Why did he not mention the ox, nor the sheep, nor anything else of that sort, but instead those that are useless and seem to be insignificant? He is showing that if in those there is so much wisdom and providence, much more so in these.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Is the arm against the Lord with you?"</i><sup><a href="#fn175" id="ref175">175</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What is destined for me, he says, concerning men, is clear from that which is perceived from observing, both from on high and from the inquiry into Providence among the living creatures. For what reason I have brought this trial upon you, you have now heard, that the cause of the abandonment is the manifestation of your virtue, in order that you may give proof of it. Here, learn of my power, and that without waging war, I allowed you to be struck; for what strength have you, that I should set myself in opposition to you in battle? Or do you have an arm equal to the arm of the Lord? Or do you possess equally strong power?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"By voice against him do you thunder?"</i><sup><a href="#fn176" id="ref176">176</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">The thunder, therefore, is not for display, and all other things, but for the knowledge of God. See through how many things He reveals the lowliness of His nature. And He does not say, "You are lowly," but rather, "I am great, and you cannot do what I do."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"But indeed, behold, beasts are beside you, eating grass like oxen."</i><sup><a href="#fn177" id="ref177">177</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">It is also possible to understand the verse concerning perceptive beasts, which often, when God wills, have their nature obscured. For the marvel is that the beast is not bloodthirsty, but feeds on the food of an ox. Since this is extraordinary, Job is asked whether something like this happens with him as well, such that the beasts eat grass but not flesh. Then he speaks of two things, one terrestrial and the other aquatic and marine. And we are not unaware that many consider these things to have been said about the devil, interpreting them allegorically. However, it is necessary first to attend to the history, and not neglect when it is fitting to benefit the listener also from the allegory.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Nations encamp in it, and nations of the Phoenicians divide it."</i><sup><a href="#fn178" id="ref178">178</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Aquila, however, they will place him between the Canaanites. So great is the mass of his body, that it is able to suffice for an entire nation. For he is not, indeed, to become of such as this he speaks. He mentioned the Phoenicians because of their trade.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Therefore, I despised myself, and was dissolved; and I considered myself earth and ashes."</i><sup><a href="#fn179" id="ref179">179</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">These things are a defense on behalf of all the former matters; for he does not speak these things having been freed from the trial, but still being in the midst of dangers, he sang a recantation. "I consider myself nothing," he says, "I make a defense for the former things, and I was unworthy of these things." What then does God do? Since he condemned himself, then God justified him. Observe the holy men, how when they are deemed worthy of greater things, they acquire more humility; thus also Abraham, when he saw the Lord, said, "But I am earth and ashes."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and he will make an offering on your behalf."</i><sup><a href="#fn180" id="ref180">180</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Not this would he have commanded if it were law; but he himself becomes a priest, those others offering the sacrifices. And behold, he offered on behalf of the children, he offers on behalf of the friends. Do you see how he shows his lack of resentment, making them witnesses to the excellence of the man; and he demonstrates the magnitude of the sin, and through the excessiveness according to the offering; for he would not have needed so many sacrifices if the sins that needed to be released were not great. And he indicates that not even sacrifice was sufficient; "For if not," he says, "because of him, I would not have let the sin remain with you," through this he shows that he also released them.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"The Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before in duplication."</i><sup><a href="#fn181" id="ref181">181</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">God allowed the devil to display all his power; and when he had exhausted all his arrows, and no method of attack was left, then He brought the athlete into the arena, so that the victory might be splendid and unquestionable.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"He was son of Zare, from the sons of Esau, and son of his mother Bosorra; so that he was fifth from Abraham."</i><sup><a href="#fn182" id="ref182">182</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">When this righteous one was shining, the Jews were still in Egypt; they were yet to depart; so that, if indeed they were willing, they would find no small offering of piety; for it was not likely to be hidden. For if even now the relics are shown, much more then would they have been displayed, while the events were still fresh, and the magnitude of the occurrences and all those in Arabia would have known.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Those who came to him were friends, Eliphaz of the sons of Esau, king of the Temanites [but Theodotion states, Son, published, Jehoshaphat], Bildad the tyrant of the Saucheans [again Theodotion states, Son Ammon the Huborite], Zophar the king of the Minaeans."</i><sup><a href="#fn183" id="ref183">183</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Each of the readers, as if seeing this noble athlete as a certain archetype image, let him imitate the courage, emulate the endurance, so that, having walked the same path, and having bravely withstood all the schemes of the devil, he may be able to attain the promised goods for those who love God; and let the sufferings of this blessed one become remedies for our own evils; and his grievous ordeal, a haven in our misfortunes. And in every event happening to us, let us reflect on the Saint; and seeing one body endure the terrors of the inhabited world, let us bravely overcome our individual circumstances; and just as toward some fond mother, stretching out her hands from all sides, and receiving and welcoming her frightened children, so let us always take refuge in this book; and even if the most pitiable and dreadful things assail us, having undoubtedly received sufficient comfort, thus shall we depart by the grace of Christ, the true God; with whom to the Father be glory, together with the Holy Spirit, now and always, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.</p>
