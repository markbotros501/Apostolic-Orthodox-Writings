    <h1>On the Egyptian Martyrs</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Blessed is God, for even from Egypt there are martyrs; from Egypt, that God-fighting and most frenzied land, from whence came godless mouths, from whence came blasphemous tongues—from Egypt there are martyrs. And not only in Egypt, nor in the neighboring and adjoining country alone, but everywhere in the inhabited world. And just as, in times of abundant produce, when the inhabitants of a city see that the harvest has exceeded the needs of its own citizens, they send it out to other cities, thereby both demonstrating their own benevolence and, in addition to their own surplus, easily purchasing again from them whatever they might need—so too have the Egyptians done with the athletes of piety. Seeing that, by the grace of God, a great harvest had arisen among them, they did not lock up this great gift of God within their city, but sent forth the treasures of these good things everywhere on earth, both demonstrating their brotherly love, and glorifying the common Master of all, and bringing honor to their own city among all people, and declaring it to be the metropolis of the entire inhabited world. For if cold and trivial opportunities, and gifts contributing only to our present life, have been able to bestow this honor upon many cities, how is it not most just that the city which bestows not these perishable and corruptible things, but men who possess great security for the cities allotted to them even after death, should receive this primacy from them above all others?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For the bodies of these saints fortify our city more securely than any wall of adamant or unbreakable stone; and like high cliffs set forth on all sides, they repel not only the assaults of these visible, sense-perceptible enemies, but also the schemes of the invisible demons, and they overthrow and dissolve every device of the devil as easily as if a noble man were to knock down and scatter children's toys. And while other contrivances made by men—such as walls, trenches, weapons, multitudes of soldiers, and all that has been devised for the safety of the inhabitants—can be countered by enemies with other, more numerous and greater excesses of devices from their own side; when a city is fortified with the bodies of saints, even if they spend countless resources, they will not be able to set up such a device against the cities that possess them. And this possession is useful for us, beloved, not only against the plots of men or the wickedness of demons, but even if our common Master is angered at us because of the multitude of our sins, we will be able, by setting forward these bodies, to quickly make Him gracious to the city. For if those who had accomplished great things among our ancestors, by invoking the names of holy men and taking refuge in the appellation of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, received some comfort and reaped great benefit from the remembrance of those names, how much more shall we, when we set forward not only names but the very bodies that contended, be able to have God gracious, gentle, and kind.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And that what we say is not empty boasting, many know, both of the locals and of those who have come from elsewhere, how great is the power of these saints, who also bear witness to what is said, having learned through experience itself their boldness before God—and very reasonably so. For they did not contend for the truth haphazardly, but so steadfastly and vigorously did they resist the violent and intolerable force of the devil, as if contending in bodies of stone and iron, not in corruptible and mortal ones, as if they had already passed over to the impassible and immortal nature, which does not yield to the bitter and painful compulsions of the body. For like some wild and fierce beasts, the crowds surrounded them on all sides, dug into their sides, scraped their flesh, exposed and laid bare their bones, and nothing checked them from that savagery and inhumanity. But even touching their backs and entrails, and entering into their innermost parts, they did not find the treasure of faith hidden within them to plunder, but suffered the same as if some men, besieging a most royal city, full of great wealth and having sufficient treasures, and having torn down its walls and come to the very storehouses of its riches, should break down doors, remove bars, dig up the floor, searching through everything, yet not be able to seize its wealth and depart.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For such are the possessions of the soul; they are not betrayed by the sufferings of the body. See how great was the endurance of the saints, which satisfied such madness with their own sufferings. He came again, contending with the madness, and striving to surpass it with other kinds of cruelty. For those beasts come to this feast by the necessity of nature, and when sated they depart, and even if they see countless bodies, they touch none of them; but this one came to this prey also by the wickedness of his will, and though filled with their flesh, he weaves another device against them, delivering the saints over to a very long and most grievous death. For he commanded them to labor incessantly in the mines. Oh, the madness! Having received so clear a proof of their courage and endurance, he expected to overcome them by this. And so the saints dwelt with beasts, they who are the companions of angels and citizens of the heavens, and who are henceforth enrolled in the heavenly Jerusalem; and henceforth the desert was holier than any city. For in the cities those lawless and tyrannical commands were dared every day; but the desert had a respite from the inhuman service; and the courts were full of unholy action and unlawful commands; but the deserts had as citizens the most law-abiding of all men, those who had become angels from among men, and the desert vied with heaven, at least in the virtue of its inhabitant citizens. And by nature the punishment was most grievous, but by the zeal of the contenders it became easy, light, and manageable. They thought they saw the light many times over then, and they believed they had already received the light spoken of by the prophet: "The moon will be as the sun, and the sun sevenfold."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For there is not, there is not a more cheerful soul than one deemed worthy to suffer something for Christ that seems to us terrible and intolerable. They already thought they had been transferred to heaven and were dancing with angels. For what more did they need of heaven and angels, when the Master of angels, Jesus, was with them in the desert? For if, where two or three are gathered in His name, there He is in the midst of them<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, much more was He then in the midst of those gathered, not as in His name, but because they were being punished unceasingly for His name. For know, know clearly, that there is no other punishment more grievous than this, and that those condemned by this sentence would choose to endure ten thousand other deaths rather than bear the pain that came from there. They were delivered to the mine, where they had to dig copper, though they themselves were often more precious than a mine of gold, than pure gold—not gold dug by the hands of convicts, but found by the zeal of faithful men; they worked the mines, they who were full of countless treasures. What is more bitter and painful than that life? They saw the narratives concerning those great men, which Paul relates concerning the saints, coming true in themselves: "They went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented—of whom the world was not worthy—wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and the holes of the earth.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> These things also happened in our generation." Knowing these things therefore, beloved, that both now and of old, ever since men came into being, all who are friends of God have been allotted a life grim, toilsome, and full of countless terrors, let us not pursue the soft, dissolute, and ease-filled life, but the toilsome, painful one, which has afflictions and hardships. For just as it is not possible for the contender to obtain the crowns through sleep, indolence, and luxury, nor the soldier the trophies, nor the pilot the harbor, nor the farmer the threshing-floor when filled, so neither can the believer, having passed his life in indolence, obtain the promised good things.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">How then is it not absurd that in all worldly matters labors are set before pleasures, and dangers before safety, and yet the expectation from those labors remains paltry and small; but when heaven is set before us, and the honors of angels, and life having no end, and the dwelling with angels, and the good things which it is not possible even to conceive or to speak of—do we expect to attain them through indolence, ease, and a dissolute soul, and not deem them worthy of the same earnestness as worldly things? Let us not, I beg you, let us not so ill advise concerning ourselves and our own salvation, but looking upon these saints, those noble and steadfast athletes, those given to us as beacons, let us direct our own life towards their endurance and patience, that by their prayers we may be able, after our departure from here, both to see and embrace them, and to be ranked with their heavenly tents. May we all attain this by the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom and with whom, to the Father and the Holy Spirit, be glory unto the ages of ages. Amen.</p>
