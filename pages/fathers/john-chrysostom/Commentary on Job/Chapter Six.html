    <h1>Chapter Six</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Then Job answered and said, 'If only my anger could be set on a scale, and my grief lifted together in a balance; it would surely be heavier than the sand of the seashore.'"</i><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></span> [By Polycronius and Chrysostom.] For "if only," instead of "I wish." Here he calls "anger" the despondency and the passion of the soul resulting from misfortunes; and "grief," the pains happening to the body from the sores; and increasing the passion by quantity, he said "together." What he says is of this sort: You philosophize about others' evils, and standing far from my misfortunes, you advise me with much ease; as if you could take my sufferings and pains upon yourselves, and weigh them as if in a balance against the seashore sand, you would find the scale heavier from these than from that. He has taken "seashore sand" because it is moister.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"When I begin to speak, they pierce me."</i><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></span> See the adversity: from those by whom I ought to be pitied, from these I am hated and condemned.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For my anger cannot cease. For I see my food as a roar, like the smell of a lion."</i><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></span> As if standing in the common theater of the inhabited world, the noble one speaks to all through the sufferings that have happened to him, bearing everything that occurs nobly, and yielding to none of the impending terrors. For there is not, there is no human passion that cannot receive comfort from there; for the sufferings scattered throughout the whole inhabited world, these, coming together into one body, fell upon his. What excuse, then, will there be for the one unable to bear with thanksgiving a part of the terrors brought upon him, who appears to bear not only a part, but the whole of all human evils? For who has become poorer than Job? He who was poorer than those thrown in the bathhouse, and those sleeping in the furnace ash, and simply poorer than all people. For those at least have a torn garment; but he sat naked, and the only garment he had from nature, the covering of flesh, the devil corrupted this all over with a severe rot; and they at least are covered with straw; but he spent the night in the open air, not even having the comfort of a bare roof. And what is greater, these know many terrible things about themselves, for which they could blame themselves (and this is no small thing for comforting misfortune: to be conscious that one is justly punished); but he was deprived even of this comfort, and having shown a life full of virtue, he endured the sufferings of those who had dared the worst. And they practiced misfortune from the beginning; but he endured poverty un-practiced, and this the most extreme, after which no other can be found; for what could be poorer than the naked one who does not even have a roof? Rather, he was not even master of enjoying any ground; for he sat not on the earth, but on the dunghill. So this one misfortune seems to people to be the subject of all terrors together. And second after that, or rather before that, is the plague of the body. For who has received such? His body was being consumed little by little, and a spring of worms gushed from his limbs everywhere, and this flow was continuous, and the foul odor was great from all sides; and the body being divided little by little and rotting with such decay made the food repulsive, and he had a strange and paradoxical hunger; for when food was given, he could not enjoy it.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For I see my food as a roar, like the smell of a lion."</i><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></span> What could be more severe than this punishment? Sleep did not rest him, food did not nourish him. <i>"Like the smell of a lion,"</i> he says; for this beast is exceedingly foul-smelling; for since it has the excess from nature, God made it otherwise more lowly than the others; and they say that even the remains of its food are inedible to other animals, due to the foul odor emanating from it. What, then, could one say about that strange hunger, which cannot even be described? The voluntary, the involuntary—for I do not know how to call it, nor do I find a name to give to the paradoxical form of misfortune; for even with food set before him, he abstained, and seeing the food, he did not touch it; for the foul odor from the bodily wounds, meeting him first, destroyed the desire, and filled the very table with repulsiveness; and indicating this, he said: <i>"For I see my food as a roar."</i><sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> And the necessity of hunger compelled him to touch what was set before him, but the excess of the foul odor arising from the flesh overcame the violence of hunger. Therefore, as I said, I do not know what to call it: voluntary? But he wanted to taste what was set before; or involuntary? But the food was present, and there was no one preventing him.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For what is my strength, that I should endure?"</i><sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></span> What power do I have, that I should endure such things? Therefore, he does not endure from strength, but from reverence and fear of God; for otherwise he would have destroyed himself; but now he entrusts the matter to prayer, and not to his own daring.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"My nearest ones did not look upon me; like a failing winter stream, or like a wave, they passed me by."</i><sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></span> And this too is the work of God's abandonment, that even relatives neglect one suffering such things. For when he himself withdraws, and a man is stripped of God's help, all things become hostile and warlike. How then, he says, do you accuse me, fallen into a magnitude of evils, and deprived of comfort from all, grieved and stung by how unexpectedly all things have turned against me?</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Those who used to be cautious of me, now fall upon me."</i><sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></span> [By Chrysostom and Polycronius.] What do I say, he says, as if my nearest ones spat upon me? They rather added to my misfortunes, and that, though a little earlier they trembled at my very name.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"So that seeing my wound, you may fear."</i><sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup></span> See, he says, lest you be called to account for your cruelty; even if nothing else—neither friendship, nor benefaction, nor anything else—makes you more gentle, the very sight of my wounds ought to fill you with much gentleness.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For what? Have I asked anything of you? Or do I need your strength, to save me from enemies, or to rescue me from the hand of the mighty?"</i><sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup></span> Have I, he says, been burdensome to you in some way, that you have treated me so mercilessly? Or did I urge you to ally with me against adversaries? Or did I beg for a gift to comfort my poverty? But indeed, neither did I need you before, nor now, but you came of your own accord, as if to comfort; why then do you accomplish the work of enemies?</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Teach me, and I will be silent; if I have erred, show me."</i><sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup></span> And if I seem to have sinned in something, make this known to me. For they did not have manifest accusations to bring forward, but simply from conjecture; and that he was of a virtuous life was manifest; but that he was not, these guessed from the punishments.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For I do not ask strength from you, nor will your reproof with words stop me; for I will not endure your utterance of a word. Except that you fall upon an orphan, and attack your friend."</i><sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></span> I do not need, he says, your help; do not come down to me, nor, as wishing to strengthen me, speak pleasing words, but reprove me with boldness; for I do not fear your reproofs, nor will I be silent in speech, since my conscience is clear, but answering each word, I hope to win. Only this I know: that you strike me with such bitter reproaches, considering neither the misfortune, nor the friendship, as if I were truly orphaned of God's help; and neither the misfortune nor the friendship bent you. But I, even if you place yourselves in the opposite camp, will not decline the contest, but will answer and proceed to defense; for I am conscious of nothing in myself.</p>
