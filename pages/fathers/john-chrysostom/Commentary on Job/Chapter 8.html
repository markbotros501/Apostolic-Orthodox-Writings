    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“Will the Lord be unjust in judging? Or will the Maker of all things overturn what is right?”</i><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></span> Of Chrysostom, Polychronius, and Olympiodorus. Do you not see, he says, how much righteousness there is in creation, how much good order? Is it possible for God to bring forth a judgment against someone without a trial? Will the One who made all things in an orderly and harmonious manner, and brought forth the beginning out of love for mankind, for your sake alone disturb the equality of what is just, and harm you contrary to justice? Gently, then, he strikes the saint, as one suffering justly, and on account of sin, this one also being of the same opinion as the one who preceded, namely that harmful things are sent altogether on account of sin. But it was necessary to reason that such things happen not only to the wicked, but also to the earnest, for they are indifferent, and that the righteous man is more admirable when he endures tribulations and pains. And since he is unable to prove that he had sinned, he turns to his sons, and says: <i>“For inquire of the former generation, and search diligently according to the lineage of the fathers; for we are of yesterday and know nothing, for our life upon the earth is a shadow.”</i><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> What he says is of this kind: Since we are short-lived, let us ask the aged, and they will report that just as it is impossible for grass to grow without moisture, so it is impossible to remain in prosperity without righteousness; and as it is not possible for the prosperity of the unjust to be strengthened; and that punishments come on account of sin.</p>
