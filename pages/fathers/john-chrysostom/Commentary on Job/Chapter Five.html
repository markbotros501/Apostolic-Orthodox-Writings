    <h1>Chapter Five</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“For pain shall not come forth from the earth.”</i><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></span> [And Symmachus said: “For pain shall not go out from dust.”] <i>“Nor shall trouble spring up from the mountains; but man is born to trouble; the young of the vulture fly high.”</i><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> What then? Do they enjoy greater providence? Far from it! Since neither the earth nor the mountains, seeing that they are insensible; for it is a natural thing, he says, an impossibility to escape misfortune. So that no one might say again that he is righteous; he says that human nature is such, not sinless. Therefore, from nature Eliphaz strongly insists, and says: It is proper to man to be examined in misfortunes. As soon as he is born, toil is his lot, and his whole life is full of labor and misery. And in this respect, our nature is inferior to things growing from the earth and mountains, having the painful in its birth and growth. And to the birds is given the ability to fly without pain, and to gather food without toil; certainly none of these belongs to man apart from misery. <i>“He who gives rain upon the earth, sending water upon the earth under heaven.”</i><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Which is the first of his beneficence, and constitutive of our life, and indicative of a change of season. <i>“But the powerless cannot come out of the hand of the mighty; and let there be hope for the powerless, and let the mouth of the unjust be stopped.”</i><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> These things, he says, God does, so that even the powerless may hope for good things, and the unjust may not be puffed up; but the boastful tongue may be stopped, and the lofty brow may be restrained. <i>“But blessed is the man whom the Lord has reproved; do not reject the instruction of the Almighty.”</i><sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> For if he is the one who loosens dire things, and turns them to the opposite, and causes one to enjoy deep peace, he does not do these things from another intention, but from the same one. <i>“Six times he will deliver you from troubles, and in the seventh, evil shall not touch you.”</i><sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> That is, he does not do these things always; but in the first instances, he allows you to experience trial; but after these, not even a trial, so that there is no longer need for you to be rescued. <i>“From the scourge of the tongue he will hide you.”</i><sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> And this is not small, but indeed very great, to be rescued from a man speaking nothing good. For nothing is worse than the tongue; it is more difficult and unbearable than any plot, any sword. <i>“You will laugh at the unjust and lawless, and you will not fear from wild beasts; for wild beasts will be at peace with you.”</i><sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> Simply, not only will those outside be peacefully disposed toward you, but also the house will enjoy much peace, and those in it will remain unstirred, both toward themselves and toward you. For nothing equals this, to be at peace within the house; for what is the benefit of being free from wars outside, if one is full of disturbance within? <i>“And you will come to the grave like ripe wheat, harvested in season; or like a heap of threshing-floor gathered in due time.”</i><sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> That is, abounding in all good things, and having arranged matters of inheritance for your children, thus you will depart this life, having reached a prosperous old age, and having nothing lacking, neither time nor life.</p>
