    <h1>Chapter Ten</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Because you have rejected the works of your hands, but you have attended to the counsel of the ungodly."</i><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do you see that he does not wish to judge for this reason, as one doing well, but because, he says, this affliction benefits me? For I fear it may also harm; it is reasonable to consider either that you do not care for the people you created, or that the wicked please you the most, and you favor their plans the most.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For you know that I have not been ungodly, but who is the one who is exempted from your hands?"</i><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Chrysostom and Olympiodorus. And I know that I have not been ungodly, but it happens that I may have been ungodly and unaware; therefore, when you punish, no one can be justified; but even if I have not been ungodly according to my opinion, I know that it is impossible to escape your counsel, instead of saying, Even if I am not aware of myself, let your counsel prevail, which, being wiser than us, understands better our circumstances.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Your hands fashioned me and made me."</i><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Chrysost. and Olymp. I am the work, he says, of your hands, even if I am sinful. Do you see how he also acknowledges God as the creator, and begs for mercy to be shown to his own creation.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"After this, having changed, you struck me. [Aquila and Theodotion, You drowned me all around.]"</i><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Accordingly, knowing Him as the beginning and Lord of creation and providence, he turns the discourse to prayer, imploring to be remembered of the fleeting and short-lived nature, and that from the beginning He made it with goodness, and being angered, punished with death, and he says.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Was it not like milk that you milked me, and coagulated me like cheese? You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me with bones and sinews; life and mercy you have granted unto me, and your care has guarded my spirit."</i><sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">He refers to the seed from which the living being is constituted as milk being milked; and just as milk being milked becomes cheese, so the seed trickling down and being twisted becomes nature; this is the first stage of the embryo. For the seed deposited into the furrows of the womb, when it is twisted like cheese and solidified, becomes nature, which then is molded further, or, as Scripture says, is formed and receives a kind of character; and the liquid nature is solidified, and what is deposited is divided into skin, flesh, bones, and sinews; these are such in themselves, having the movement of life while the soul is present, but when it departs, they are left inactive. Not only, he says, have you granted life unto me, which signifies the natural quality of creation, but you have also made mercy with me, through which providential grace is indicated, and throughout my life I have enjoyed your providence; for this is the meaning of</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Your care has guarded my spirit,"</i><sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></span></p>
        <p class="paragraph">that is, after being born, I have attained life through your providence; and simply, he recounts the entire course and harmony of the constitution of the body, both through the preceding things and those presented here.</p>
