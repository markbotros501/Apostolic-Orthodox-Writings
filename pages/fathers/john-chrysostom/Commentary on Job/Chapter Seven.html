    <h1>Chapter Seven</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Is not the life of man upon earth a trial? And as the life of a hireling of the day? Or as a servant fearing his master, and obtaining a shadow? Or as a hireling waiting for his wage?"</i><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></span> Does it not seem to you, he says, that the life of all men is filled with trials and circumstances? And as every man resembles a daily hireling, who labors the whole day that he may receive a little something? Or a servant fearing his own master, and scarcely ever obtaining a little rest? Or simply a hireling, even if not daily, that after many toils he may receive some wage? Through these, then, he wishes to show the toilsome and brief nature of life; and he says: Is it not full of toils only, but also of dangers? But I think he speaks about a runaway slave being in constant anxiety because of the flight; for this is implied: "obtaining a shadow," that is, considering things not present as present because of fear, and seeking darkness under which he may be hidden. However, if life is a trial, how is it possible for one in a trial not to fall into temptation? So it happens that I have suffered these things not only from injustice, but even from nature itself.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Nights of pains are given to me. If I lie down, I say, When will it be day? And when I rise, again, When will it be evening? And I am full of pains from evening until morning."</i><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></span> You saw also the unbearable trial of the night, which itself is new and paradoxical. For all other people, even if they suffer countless things, even if they dwell in prison, even if they wear chains, even if they lament misfortunes, even if they endure bodily mutilation, even if they are oppressed by poverty, by disease, by toils and miseries—the coming night brings the medicine of comfort, releasing the body from toils, loosening the soul from cares. But for Job then, the harbor became a cliff, and the medicine turned into a wound, and the comfort was an addition of more severe pain, and the storm became more fearful in that which provides calm to all people; and he fled, as from waves, from the day because of those unbearable pains, but he found storms, whirlwinds, reefs, and rocks, so that he again sought the waves of the day; and having the present burdensome, he desired the absent, hastening to run through the intervals of time because of the agonies. Therefore, describing this new passion, he cried out saying, "If I lie down, I say, When will it be day? If I rise, I say, When will it be evening?" Tell me, for what reason? For in the day you reasonably seek the night, since it provides release from all daily toils; but being in the night, and in calm and forgetfulness of those pains and cares, why again do you seek the day, tell me? Because for me the night is more severe than the day; for it does not provide me release from toils, but intensity, and disturbances, and turmoil. And describing this very thing, he said: <i>"You frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions."</i><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> For he dreaded this, seeing fearful sights at night, and enduring unbearable fear, and much ecstasy and terror; and what was given to others for rest, for him was rather an intensification of misfortunes.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"My body is covered with the rot of worms; I scrape off clods of earth from the discharge."</i><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></span> By saying, "I scrape off clods of earth," he indicates that he was no longer afflicted, as I think, with a potsherd, but henceforth he did this with earth. Through all these things, however, he instructs his friends concerning endurance and about rejecting the notion that he suffers because of sin, so that from the excess of pains they may consider that he is not so wicked as to suffer such things; for they ought to consider their own circumstances, and thus know those concerning Job. Unceasing pains, and discharge, and worms, at the same time demonstrated endurance and courage.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"But my life is lighter than speech. [The others rendered: 'swifter than a runner.'] It is lost in vain hope. [And Symmachus: 'my days are consumed, there being no hope.']"</i><sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></span> Perhaps, "My life is lighter than speech," can signify the transience of life, that it is not fixed, but dissolving, like speech. It can also indicate the excessive pain, and that the matters of pain have come to him unto death. And "swifter than a runner," because as those, before they stand still, leap over; so also glory, before it arrives, flies away. "My life is lost," he says, "in vain hope." Why? Because I have suffered, and received no reward; because in misfortunes, and I have no good end.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For if a man goes down to Hades, he will not come up again, nor will he return to his own house, nor will his place know him any longer."</i><sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></span> It is worthy especially for this reason to marvel at the righteous man, that knowing nothing about resurrection, he was pained, yet bore it nobly. For that he did not know anything clear about the mystery of regeneration from the dead, is clear from this: For he says, to the one who has once gone down to Hades through death, it is not given again, having revived, to return to his own house; nor will even memory of him be left, having become invisible from the living; for it is not possible for the dead to rise.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"I said that my bed will comfort me. [Symmachus: 'will console.'] And I will bring to myself privately a word with my couch. [Theodotion: 'My bed will bear with me in my babbling.'] You frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions."</i><sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></span> What happened to the righteous man alone, this in no other; for he did not have the comfort from the night, but the appearance of nightly fears was a greater addition to the daytime terrors. For that he endured more severe things in sleep, hear what he says: "Why do you frighten me with dreams, and terrify me with visions?" What man of iron, what adamant, could have endured so many terrors? For if each of these alone is unbearable, consider how much tumult they raised when coming together; but nevertheless, he bore all these things, and in all that had happened to him, he did not sin, nor with his lips; and this, having no interval in the misfortunes, but both by night and by day, being disturbed by the passions. I omit speaking of the daytime terrors, but not even the night provided him release; therefore he said, <i>"You terrify me with visions,"</i> and the very time of relaxation, when I expect to babble a little with my thoughts, and to obtain sleep and rest, fearful dreams stand before me; and this happens especially and naturally to those tempted by day, as also the wise Ecclesiastes said, that a dream comes in the multitude of temptations. It is likely also that the devil, showing some fearful phantasms, terrified him and disturbed him in sleep. But this blessed one, not yet fully assured that he was demanded by the devil, thinks that God brings both these things and the torments upon him. And indeed this too was of the devil's operation; for God brought nothing upon him, but all was from the hand of the devil.</p>
