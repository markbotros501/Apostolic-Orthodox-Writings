    <h1>Exposition and Prologue</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">Exposition</p>
        <p class="paragraph">At first it might seem necessary to inquire at what time this man lived. Some indeed say that he was before Moses, and that he is the fifth from Abraham; others that he lived under the Law. But we do not yet decide anything immediately; rather let us learn from the history itself whether he lived at this or that time. Yet this is not of little importance for us in order to know the virtue of this man. For it is one thing to have become so great, having lived before the Mosaic institutions, with such great virtue, such great admiration; and another to have displayed such great strength by oneself even before those institutions were established. Moreover, that this man was great, not only does the matter itself demonstrate, but also God shows it, saying: <i>If Noah, Daniel, and Job were there, they would deliver neither son nor daughter<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></i>. But why did Moses make no mention of him? Yet what necessity was there for mentioning him, or of what benefit would it be? But you consider for me how the grandson of his great-grandfather harmed Esau. He was not from Abraham, and therefore not from Jacob; indeed, he lived in a barbarous region. Do you see that God sent teachers to all? Meanwhile, I wish you to notice how the knowledge of God above was everywhere manifest: for you see that his friends also had knowledge of God. Who taught them? Who announced it to them? He indeed lived before the Law. And hence I think that one would not say without reason that this man Job was a certain teacher and herald of the knowledge of God. For he became known through his manner of life and patience; but it was fitting that miracles also be found in him, so that, perfected in all respects, he might become a teacher. For just as there were many signs in Abraham, so also in this man, etc.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><i>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></i> Consider this first praise: <i>a man in the land of Uz</i>, he says, which is also a great commendation. For to have been such in Arabia, where all were depraved, where no example of equity presented itself, this was indeed wonderful: <i>And that man was blameless, upright, fearing God, and turning away from evil.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></i> These are all the things that could commend the beauty of his soul: but as the lover diligently recounts the beauty of the day and also of his beloved, so the writer proceeds here. <i>Blameless</i>, he says, that is, perfect in virtue; and this, <i>upright</i>; and this, <i>fearing God</i>; and this, <i>turning away from evil</i>; and this, <i>from every</i>, he says; not simply, from this certainly, but from that not so. Where are those who say that nature is more inclined to evil? What punishments, what laws made this man such? Who moreover said: <i>It is not you who does good and does not sin</i>? Therefore, he says, <i>blameless</i>, not without sin, but <i>blameless</i>: that is, not only did he not commit things that are sins, but not even those things that have complaint or reproach, etc.</p>

        <p class="subheading">Prologue</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Moreover, that this book is useful for every age and condition of life, for man and woman alike, for old and young, for private citizen and ruler, for rich and poor, for one enjoying good fortune and one struggling with adversities, is easy to show. For this man is admirable and great, long celebrated everywhere in the world, an athlete of piety and deemed worthy of the crown, who endured every kind of contest, who erected innumerable trophies against the devil, was rich and poor, held in honor and despised, father of many children and bereaved, in kings' palaces and on the dunghill, in splendid clothing, and after this in a spring of worms, with a thousand attentions, with servants later rising up, friends reviling, and a wife plotting, he suffered infinite insults. All things flowed to him as from a fountain: abundance of riches, magnitude of power, celebrity of glory, security of peace, honor, respect, health of body, and the honorable and noble form of his children. Nothing sad or bitter was there; riches were present with security, and happiness subject to no misfortunes: and indeed deservedly. For God had fortified him with a unique rampart; but afterwards all those things flew away, and a thousand storms took up residence in his house, continual and frequent, and beyond measure heavy: for what he had possessed, suddenly all were snatched from him, his children slain at table and feast, not by sword and blade, but by a hostile and violent wind shattering the house, they were overwhelmed by a sudden and violent destruction. After this, his wife was armed, and moved her machines against him; friends also and servants, these indeed defiled his face with spit, those moreover insulted more contumeliously; he was cast out from every roof, the dunghill was his dwelling, he swarmed everywhere with springs of worms, he flowed uncontrollably with blood and pus, and having become his own executioner, he scraped the pus with a potsherd. His pains were uninterrupted and intolerable, night more bitter than day, and day more troublesome than night; all things full of precipices and rocks, with no one to help him, but those who insulted him innumerable: nevertheless, in such a great storm, and in such unspeakable waves, he stood firm bravely and unchangeably. The cause of this was that he rightly considered the nature of things with himself, and knowing their mutability, he foresaw the future, and when he enjoyed prosperous fortune, he did not think sorrow and bitterness alien from himself, and therefore in favorable circumstances he was of a moderate mind.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This man, however, who suffered innumerable things, is proposed as an example not only of endurance of labor and patience, but also of other virtues, to those who apply their mind; indeed of fortitude and constancy in temptations; but also of abstinence from insults, in riches and power, that they might share their things with others like a soldier and with a cheerful and moderate mind; of temperance in pleasures; of justice in judgments and contracts; in all things, of concord and charity, which is the head of the remaining virtues; for he fulfilled every virtue with due zeal and care. Therefore, recalling this expressed and delineated image in your memory, depict it in your conscience; if you lie in mourning, flee to this; if you abound in resources, lest you be overwhelmed by poverty, or puffed up by riches, receive medicine from here; if you are bereaved of children, have consolation from here (for here you will find both an excess of calamities and endurance); if you fall into sickness, consider the sores of worms with yourself, and you will bear all things gently and calmly; if a friend plots against you, again bring the saint into the midst, and you will overcome the illness; if the crowd of men receives you badly, think what he endured from servants, and you will find full medicine; if someone involves you in wicked suspicion, let what they said about him (namely, that he would not have suffered deserved punishments for his sins), and with what contumelies they received him, come into your mind and you will overcome this illness. For there is no human calamity—famine, poverty, sickness, bereavement of children, sudden loss of immense riches—which this man, stronger and more stable than any diamond, did not sustain by enduring; and afterwards, plotted against by his wife, vexed by the contumelies of friends, spat upon by servants, in all things more stable than any rock, and indeed he appeared before the Law and grace. And truly if we, after the Law and grace, enriched with so great a benefit, endure lesser things than he who showed such equanimity in the beginning of the world and in the first ages of the human race, we will lack all excuse.</p>
