    <h1>St. John Chrysostom on Job – Chapter One</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER ONE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What does the preface mean, and why did the writer begin in this way? He was about to set forth a life celebrated for virtue, and one which far exceeded our manner of living. So that no one, amazed by the incredible magnitude of the contests and sufferings, might think him endowed with some foreign and non-human nature, he first shows his nature, so that you might admire the character of him who, though soft by nature, yet excelled many in virtue. What was common to nature, he said, so that he might indicate what was proper to his purpose; because he who was a partaker of the same nature as others, accomplished things greater than nature and man. Praise is also drawn from his region, so that you might admire what kind of rose sprouted from a thorn.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Observe, moreover, the first praise, that such an offspring was produced by the region of Uz. For in Arabia, where all lived with corrupt morals, where no example of probity existed, to find someone so upright and esteemed, was not without admiration.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And that man was blameless, upright, fearing God, and turning away from evil.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">When the pagan philosophers explain the definition of man, they say: Man is a rational, mortal animal; but divine Scripture defines him as a man who keeps the likeness of God, and who is known by virtue; but he who confounds and corrupts the divine types and marks, is not deemed worthy of the name of man: for if anyone has the character of human nature, but violates and afflicts it with the perverse institution of his life, he hears from the Prophet: <i>Man when he was in honor, did not understand; he is compared to the senseless beasts, and is become like to them.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></i> Therefore, in this place, using its own custom, divine Scripture, showing nothing so distinguishes a man as being blameless, upright and godly, illustrating Job with these very things, pronounces and says, <i>he was a true man</i>. For the wicked are false men, not unlike painted ones. Ecclesiastes confirms this very thing, summing up all precepts under the end, and referring to the fear of God as to the head: <i>The end of the word, hear all: Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole man.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></i> Also another who prophesied in Jerusalem, where he saw no one to hear: <i>I looked, and there was no man; I called, and there was none that would answer.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></i> We also, not departing from the custom of daily speech, when we send a servant or son to accomplish some business, are accustomed to say; "Be a man in undertaking the matter"; that is, preserve the human condition; endowed with mind and reason, think and act: show by the performance of your duty that you are a man. For not from figure, but from action, what each one is understood; otherwise by mere homonymy of the word, it is said to be what it is called. He alone is a true man, who, having preserved the image, has not at all obscured the beauty granted by God; such was Job, true, not feigned, who by deeds themselves declared the virtue of a man, not pretended by habit, nor simulated it as an actor.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But what God formerly demanded from Abraham, when he said: <i>Walk before me, and be perfect<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></i>, Scripture now testifies concerning Job; for after it said he was true, it added, <i>without reproach</i>. Weigh the word with me, so that you may understand the full perfection of the just. Why did it not say 'without crime', but 'without reproach'? Doubtless because crime is placed in the greatest sins; but reproach in small and minimal ones. Not only, therefore, it says, did he abstain from the gravest faults, but he did not allow himself to be pressed even by the slightest, which are worthy of blame rather than criminal accusation, and merit disapproval of deed, but not punishment. Aquila rendered 'without reproach' as 'simple'; Symmachus as 'innocent', the former indicating a mind free from all wickedness and artifice of simulation, the latter an institution even to the highest virtue. For he is innocent who lacks no good; who lives a life removed from all wickedness. After 'blameless', it adds 'upright'; for the comprehension and sum of all things that are honest and good is justice: for if any of those things which seem to merit praise, separated by itself from the remaining virtues, be found in someone, it will be imperfect and useless, or even, on the contrary, found worthy of blame. For example, one may have intelligence and skill; unless he also meditates on just counsels, being crafty and cunning, and endowed with corrupt morals, he will by no means be prudent. Concerning these it is said: <i>They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></i> Again, one may be vigorous in spirit for contests and dangers; unless he also wishes to administer just things, he will be cruel and will bring violence, as they speak: <i>Let our fierceness be the law of justice<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></i>; for what is weak is found useless. One may restrain the pleasures of the body, yet he will not be temperate if he is greedy for money and riches, if he is wasteful, if he is illiberal, if through desire for money he is prodigal. Finally, any part of justice, if separated from the rest as if from a body, is nothing.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But the harmony of all things that merit praise, rightly is and is considered to be justice: if indeed any of the things that have admiration be lacking, it limps on that account, and is mutilated, and falsely bears the name of justice. For in the beginning, he who is just, must also be wise; for by what reason will he perform what ought to be done, and conduct himself fittingly in all things, if he does not understand the order and power of each thing? Then temperate, for intemperance is injustice; a lover of God, for <i>they who are pious, have thought just things<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup></i>; gentle, beneficent, humane: and, to say it once, the harmony of all things to be done which agree with right reason, completes the just man, which Ezekiel excellently taught us, through whom God says: <i>But the man who shall be just, who does justice...<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup></i> Then he describes the just man, composing the perfect and whole virtue from the parts; and first he attaches piety to him, saying: <i>He has not eaten upon the mountains<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup></i> (for on the mountains they performed idolatries). Then he says that temperance must be present in him: <i>And he has not defiled his neighbor's wife<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></i>; and he has not approached a woman in her menstrual impurity. Then he also ascribes meekness and clemency to him: <i>And he has not oppressed any man by power<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup></i>. He declares him content with his own things, saying: <i>And he has not taken robbery<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup></i>; he also depicts him as merciful and sharing his goods with others, saying: <i>He has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment, he has not given his money upon usury, and has not taken any increase<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup></i>. He shows him easy to reconcile and peaceful, so that he can also be the best arbiter for those in dispute: <i>And from iniquity, he says, he shall turn away his hand, and he shall execute true judgment between man and man<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup></i>. For this political and judicial faculty, compared with the other duties of justice, is far more excellent and illustrious; and because it renders to each what is fitting, it is named from law. Having enumerated all those things which are either to be done or not to be done, he adapted a common rule and type for all, looking to which, one will err in nothing. <i>He has walked in my commandments, and kept my judgments, to do them.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup></i> And from all these bound together and mixed, and as it were a body formed from many parts and held together in full harmony, the just man becomes. And having perfected him with so many things, and as it were forming one definition and description from so many, he concluded all in one name, saying: <i>This just man shall live.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup></i> Since, therefore, we have heard what are the things that characterize the just, let us consider these things also in Job. The just man is pious; what then of Job? Did he not worship God with sacrifices each day? Chaste and temperate, as he says: <i>I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would not think upon a virgin<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup></i>. Meek and gentle, and what is gentler than this? whose servants also, on account of his incredible kindness, so hung upon him, that they desired even to swallow him; for they said: <i>Who will give us of his flesh that we may be filled?<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup></i>. Merciful and sharing, and who in this respect is a rival to Job? <i>His door was open to all comers, and no one departed empty from his bosom<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup></i>. The just man judges justly among disputants. Here also Job is permitted to boast, and to say: <i>The cause which I knew not, I searched out; and I broke the jaws of the wicked<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup></i>. The just man does no wrong to anyone; but Job even curses himself: <i>If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, then let my shoulder fall from its socket.<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup></i> Since, therefore, Job fulfilled every part of virtue with exceeding care, he is called blameless and just.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Thus also Job was just: not having one part of virtue in him, but possessing all human virtue whole and universal, not abstaining from this evil thing while clinging to another. So also we call that just weight which is equal everywhere, not if it can weigh gold justly, but lead unjustly; but that which renders equality in all materials, and again a measure equal everywhere. So also Job was just, being equal everywhere. For he preserved this equality not only in money, but also in all other things, nowhere exceeding the measure. For no one could say that in money he cherished fairness, but in interaction with his neighbors he exceeded the measure, being haughty and contemptuous; but he also fled from this, saying: <i>If I have despised the judgment of my manservant or maidservant, when they contended with me, what then shall I do when God rises up? For did not he that made me in the womb make him?<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup></i> Therefore this is the greatest injustice, to be boastful and proud: for just as we call greedy one who desires to seize others' things, and is not content with his own; so we call proud one who demands more from his neighbor than is owed to a man; when someone places himself in all honor, but wishes to dishonor another, this indeed happens from nothing else than injustice. For God made one substance for all, gave all things common and equal to one's neighbor; how then do you cast him out and deprive him of the honor which God gave, not allowing him to be a partner, but making everything your own, making him poor not in riches, but in glory? God granted one substance to both, and the preeminence of substance; for <i>Let us make man<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup></i> is common to the whole race. How then do you cast him out from his paternal substance, reducing him to the lowest poverty, and appropriating what is common? But blessed Job was not such, therefore he said: <i>I have not despised the judgment of my servant or maidservant<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup></i>. Therefore the writer, saying he was just, presents him not as having a partial justice, which is observed in transactions and lawsuits, but as having universal virtue, according to him of whom it is written: <i>The law is not made for the just.<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup></i> And he adds that he is also godly, to show that he was perfect both towards men and towards God; for justice is towards men, godliness towards God. See how the virtues follow one another and support each other: for a good life causes one to know God, and the knowledge of God becomes the guardian of life. Whence also Job, since he was just, therefore was also godly; and since he always had God before his eyes, therefore he justly pursued what is just, for the sake of the good itself, and not for anything else. But one cannot become just without first becoming blameless. For this reason, the true man comes first, who is not clothed with a pretense and appearance of piety, but pursues virtue in truth and reality, and is formed according to it. Then follows this, the blameless; for the genuine worker of virtue guards even from things that seem small. To him again follows the one named from perfect justice, the just, perfected in every kind of virtue. Then the godly comes in more splendidly after these, distinguished both by good works and right doctrines. To these is added, 'abstaining from every evil thing', which itself leaves no room for excess. For it is not said that he abstained from this evil, but not from that, or that he controlled many things, but was controlled by few, but he wished to touch no wickedness.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">It is not enough, however, only to abstain from evils, but the working of good must also be present. For the idleness of virtue knows how to procure punishment, not only the activity of wickedness. Since even those who have not fed the hungry, because they did not exercise mercy, are handed over to immortal punishment. From this we learn that abstaining from evils is not the beginning of salvation for us, unless the possession of good things and the activity of virtue are also present. But you, see how in a few words the custom of the divine Spirit gathered the praise of this man: for having called him true on account of creation, describing as it were his native land and ancestors, he said he was blameless on account of his conduct, just on account of fairness of law and sharing of his possessions, and also on account of giving right judgments; and what is chief of all, godly towards God on account of faith and hatred of idols; abstaining from every evil thing on account of his most ardent enmity with all evils. And to sum up, he did nothing worthy of accusation or complaint: but he kept human laws, and with uncorrupted mind managed what pertains to religion; doing all things according to God's command, and worshiping the divine Majesty lawfully.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">First he expressed the man's virtue, then those things which were granted by God's gift. For from virtue these followed: abundant and well-constituted offspring. <i>There shall not be,</i> he says, <i>one that shall not bear fruit, nor barren in your land.<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup></i> But yet Abraham was without children, so that you might learn that the rewards of virtue are not these, but certain others. Nevertheless, God, indulging, promised them.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From this we gather that marriage is by no means an impediment to virtue: otherwise Job also would have been without it. But doubtless a bond of this kind did not at all retard his right course; therefore some complain about marriage in vain.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; and his works were great on the earth.<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">See a man abundant in rustic wealth; for he did not count accounts of loans and usuries, nor houses adorned with golden ceilings; whence there was no doubt that he could have done good to others: but he counted sheep and oxen, and what is received from seasons and agriculture, with which he sufficed for the needy. For, as I said, Scripture sets before us a king not boasting in precious material, but content with those things which moderately help necessity. It makes no mention of horses, nor of chariots glued with gold, nor of treasures of silver and gold, nor of precious stones, nor of other things by which the disease of men gaping at riches is inflamed, but enumerates those things which do not exceed the necessity of life. For although he had sons, he received no wound from money, considering the abundance of things as wealth, being free from desires, and not at all serving honor or disturbances. Since, however, that is marked by an obelisk: <i>and a very great household</i>, it must be known that things which are marked by an obelisk are not held in the version, but are placed by the Seventy only for clarity. But to want to transfer the description of these animals, differing in kind, to a spiritual theory, is superfluous, and pertains to the art of interpreting dreams.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And that man was noble among those of the East.<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Symmachus rendered: the greatest of all the Orientals. He was, he says, more clear and illustrious than all, and he had notable and noble ancestors, whom he could number; but none of these inflated him with pride and arrogance.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And his sons went and made a feast in the house of each one on his day, and sending they called their three sisters to eat and drink with them.<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Having harmonious virtue, they were also without dissension in sensible things, going to one another, and not far away, nor making associations with others; and they also took their sisters, as witnesses of their temperance; for they did not call strange women to their love-feasts and dinners, but took their sisters along, which is a clear sign of temperance and modesty. But the devil found their concord and association as an opportunity for a plot against them all, to overthrow all at once in the house of the eldest brother.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And when the days of the feast were completed, Job sent and sanctified them, rising up early.<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">See a purification, not Mosaic, but apostolic: cleansing their mind, not bodies, with prayers. Some say that those ancient priests, like Melchizedek, were without ordination; this then is indicated by <i>he sent</i>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And it came to pass on a certain day, that behold, the angels of God came to stand before the Lord, and Satan came among them.<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">God, who is invisible to all created nature, without magnitude, present everywhere, standing over all things, encompassing all, and there is no place outside his dominion, is present to each, as is fitting. For to the holy angels, as to holy ones, sending secret voices of commands; to the wicked one, as to wicked, allowing permission to tempt men. For the devil can do nothing, except what is allowed by God. And he does not stand in the heavenly places, far from it; for from there he was cast out. For it says: <i>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, who didst rise in the morning?<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup></i> Yet he is said to stand among the angels, because he also is in the places of God's dominion, and awaits to be permitted or allowed to make temptations against men; not fulfilling some ministry to God, but since he was brought to this by his perversion and wickedness, and rages against us. He is allowed by him who rightly manages our affairs, to bring upon us temptations which we are able to bear. Scripture, having outlined these things, brought forth the discourse in a figurative manner for our understanding. That <i>And it came to pass on a certain day</i> is instead of: a day came when the theater was opened, and the athlete descended to the wrestling. And since the holy angels care for us and protect us; but the devil works against our salvation, and concerning the same matter, that is, man, they contend with each other; they are said to stand together at the same time, with God observing the things being done. But we are conquered or conquer, not on account of the power of adversaries or the weakness of allies helping us, but on account of our own choice and freedom of will. For since each draws us to themselves, the holy angels persuading good, the accursed demons evil, it is in the power of our will, which is endowed with free choice, to give itself to which part it wishes. For neither are we forced by him who honored us with free will, nor does the devil have any coercive power against us: but by our will, adhering to angels or demons, we act rightly or sin.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And the Lord said to Satan: Whence comest thou?<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Why then is the devil present together in the angelic service and obedience? And in the midst of the choir of saints, does the impure spirit dare to speak? Neither angels nor Satan stand before God in a bodily manner; but any ministry is called standing. The devil, therefore, as a creature of God, is ordered to do what ought to be done: and although by will he has shaken off the reins of divine command, yet he is under the yoke of servitude, and is ordered to do what is commanded as a torturer and executioner. And just as among us, princes, when they summon someone with honor, send honorable men; but when they drag someone to themselves with dishonor, they send certain cruel attendants; so God sends holy angels as ministers for salvation to the saints, but when someone is to be restrained by punishment, he entrusts that to wicked powers. Thus Paul delivers the one who acted wickedly at Corinth to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, and likewise others, lest they blaspheme.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And Satan answered the Lord and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it that is under heaven, I am present.<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Using the form of question and answer, Scripture more expressed the truth of the matter, and cut off every pretext of shameless men. For what it says the devil said to God, he did not indeed say, but only thought; for he did not attain to such audacity and license. But in that he says he has traversed all places, first he accuses himself, that he has no fixed place of abode, but wanders through all regions as a vagabond, waging war against the human race. Secondly, we learn that the world is filled both with angels and demons, and that both are under divine power, and that angels indeed come to God to receive commands; but the devil, unless permission is granted him from above, can do nothing according to his own pleasure. For although he has refused the reins, and is outside obeying God, nevertheless fear is imposed as a bridle, and God does not allow him to use his own power. But see, they indeed come as servants reporting what is done; this one has nothing, he says. Heaven, therefore, is inaccessible to this wicked demon, and he is not present everywhere at the same time, but making a circuit. That <i>under heaven</i>, he says, to indicate also the desert, and whatever is subject to heaven, and the airy region. He wanders also the uninhabited, perhaps by some dispensation of God, so that he may not trouble our race continually.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant Job?<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">From this we learn that God wished Job to be tempted, as having a noble athlete; for for this reason he questions the devil, so that he might give him an opportunity for the contest, but he himself did not wish to provide the opportunity, lest he seem to be ambitious. But see how gradually the manner of discourse is changed; for no longer does he show him making a report of words, but that <i>Hast thou considered?</i> which the history gave as a voice. God, therefore, granted the devil to know even without voice, that his wicked plan and action did not escape him, and as it were he speaks to him, <i>Whence comest thou?</i> not wishing to learn the dwelling of the wicked (for how, he who has present knowledge of all things?), but he is accustomed often to present what is said in the form of a question, as also in the Gospels the Lord brings questions about Cleopas: <i>What are these words that you exchange with one another?<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup></i> And who would dare to say that he who formed the hearts of each one singly, needs questioning? So also that, <i>How many loaves do you have?<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup></i> and elsewhere, confirming his resurrection, he said, <i>Have you anything to eat here?<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup></i> and about Lazarus he inquired, <i>Where have you laid him?<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup></i> he who anticipated the report, and foretold his death. In the same manner here, saying to the devil, <i>Whence comest thou?</i> and <i>Hast thou considered my servant?</i> he does not offer words of ignorance, nor does he wish to be taught the life of the adversary, but shows him himself an accuser of his own cruelty. For wickedness is wont to wound itself.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>A man blameless, true, godly, abstaining from every evil thing.<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What harm is it to be despised by men and by the whole world, when the Lord of angels praises and proclaims? Just as, if he does not bless, even if all who inhabit land and sea praise, there is no profit. Therefore let us observe this everywhere, how he himself may proclaim us; if this be, we are higher than all, even if in poverty, and in sickness, and in sensible evils. For even blessed Job, sitting on the dunghill, surrounded by the pus of sores, bursting with countless springs of worms, suffering those unbearable things, spat upon by servants, plotted against by friends, by enemies, by a wife, cast into poverty, into famine, into that incurable sickness, was more blessed than all. How? Because God blessed him, saying: <i>A just man, blameless, true, godly.</i> For how did he not surpass all on earth, God of all bearing witness to him, in saying, <i>blameless, a true man</i>, having an incomparable virtue, keeping the just things towards men blamelessly, and diligently pursuing piety towards God? And that the devil, considering his circumstances, held no small wonder about him. But why does he change the order of the praises here? Perhaps he does this indifferently, or perhaps he arranges the praise according to the nature and harmony of things. For first, every man is true, according to the reason of creation; then thus blameless, according to the manner of conduct; here, on account of the battle with the devil, he puts blameless before true. For virtue knows how to fight with vice, and the justice of character becomes the sharpest arrow against the envious. Then he joins true to blameless, to show that nature also agrees with character, and choice adorning the nobility of nature.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And you have made his cattle many upon the earth.<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">You see wealth given to Job by God; you see it was not acquired unjustly: <i>You,</i> he says, <i>have blessed the work of his hands, and you have multiplied his goods.</i> How much would Job have to labor, to persuade men that his wealth was not from injustice? Behold the devil testified this to him, even though he does not know.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>But now stretch forth thy hand, and touch all that he hath, and see if he will not bless thee to thy face.<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For this is <i>to thy face</i>: openly, shamelessly, reverencing nothing.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he has I give into your hand, but do not touch him.<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">So much, he says, do I trust in the virtue of my athlete, that although you said: <i>Stretch forth thy hand</i>, I on the contrary say: <i>I give into your hand all that he has</i>; into your hand, wicked and insatiable one. What do you say? What need is there for new testing after your testimony? But, he says, that the mouth of the devil may be stopped, that the just man may appear more splendid, that we may leave for posterity medicines of endurance and tribulation.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And it was on a certain day.<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore the writer, to show the swiftness of the plot, he showed the time; for it was not yet midday, when the beginning of preaching took place.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And behold, a messenger came to Job, and said to him,</i> etc.<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Murder is mixed with destruction, which makes the enemies appear burdensome; great is the cruelty, and the inhumanity; double is the calamity—murder and captivity; and the salvation of the one remaining, an addition to the evils.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">You see how swift the blow is—a new and strange calamity. He who was in such abundance, and had never experienced anything like it, suddenly came to be deprived of all his possessions. For not some things were taken away, and others left behind as a comfort for those perishing, but he alone remains, who announces the tragedy.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said to Job, “Fire fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and consumed the shepherds likewise, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</i><sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">The evil one regretted that he had announced the first things badly. “Badly,” he says, “I shot, I did not hit the target; the arrow went astray.” I said that men had taken captive the donkeys and oxen; Job could reason: “Men have wronged me; what is this to God? Shall I ascribe the injustice of men to God? Others are the wrongdoers, and another will be the one blasphemed?” Therefore, in order to turn his mind from men to God, he says: “Fire fell from heaven.” Aquila and Theodotion said, “fire of God.” You cannot say, “Enemies set fire from above; insult the one who wronged you, blaspheme the one who made war on you. Why does he serve Him? Why worship the one who destroys your possessions?” Do not think the blows are human; hearing that they were taken captive from above, war is waged against you from heaven—God. And it is clear, so that fire coming down from heaven consumed the sheep. See how great the devil’s power is, how he stirred up so many nations, whether shaping demons into enemies—understand the ease for me—not thinking it was truly fire (for he cannot create), but he thus showed burning everything; or if it was truly fire, he stirred it from existing things, God permitting.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>When Job heard this, he arose and tore his robe and shaved his head.</i><sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do not marvel that he tore his garments and shaved his head; for he was a father and loved his children; the feeling of natural sympathy had to be shown, and the philosophy of the soul by no means hidden. For if he had not done that, perhaps someone might suspect that his philosophy was alien to the common feeling of humanity; therefore he showed both the bowels of nature and the excellence of philosophy, nor was his soul struck by grief.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do not think that Job showed himself conquered by that deed, but rather it demonstrates his victory; for if he had not done it, someone might have said that the sense of evils had wholly taken away even God. But now, grieving and mourning, he philosophizes, and truly set his own soul upon a rock. The rain descended: “Fire,” he says, “fell from heaven and devoured all the flocks of sheep”; rivers came, frequent, continuous, and without interval—messengers of calamities, one expounding the destruction of the sheep, another of the camels, another of the sons; winds blew, dreadful words of the wife: “Speak a word against the Lord,” she says, “and die.” The house fell, but the soul was not cast down; the just man uttered nothing blasphemous, but gave thanks; although the devil waged war against him, who by nature is evil and fierce, who is never reconciled to the human race, but wages war against us without treaty or truce; and he showed himself not only angry and offended, but also applied all devices and arts of deception. But not even thus did he convict the strength of the just man, who, like a vigorous soldier, eluded his arrows with mockery, and with great fortitude repelled the force of the fiercest war: and this not under grace, but before the times of the New Testament; and he made clear that the cause of falling is to be referred not to the nature of temptations, but to the sloth of idle men; just as exercise adds strength to the strong man and makes him stronger: “For tribulation,” he says, “produces patience.”<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup> For as robust trees, although strong winds rush upon them and shake them on all sides, cannot be uprooted, but are even more strongly strengthened by such attacks; so the stable soul, religiously nourished, is not overturned by the tempests of evils sent upon it, but is established more firmly; and this can be made clear, if the possessor guards it with due diligence.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This the most wicked and savage demon knows well. For on this account he stripped Job of his possessions, not to make him poor, but to compel some blasphemous word; he also lacerated his body with sores, not to cast him into sickness, but to tear down the virtue of his soul. But yet, when he had applied all devices, and made him needy from wealth, and, what seems most fearful to us all, bereft of children, orphaned of all offspring, and surpassing the savagery of torturers who stand around the tribunals of judges, cruelly tore his whole body (for not even the iron nails of deserters pierce the sides as the mouths of worms lacerated Job’s flesh), and when he had created an evil opinion of him in the minds of men (for the friends who were present said to his face: “By no means have you been punished equal to your sins,”<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup> and brought forth many other speeches full of accusation); although, finally, he gave him no other city when cast out from city and home, but made a dwelling of dung and filth instead of a city and house; nevertheless, not only did he not harm him with any loss or evil, but even from those very things which he secretly plotted against him, he made him more illustrious. And when he had overthrown him from the possession of so many goods, he not only did not despoil him of goods, but even amassed for him much more abundant wealth of virtue; for exercised by greater contests and greater dangers, he became bolder afterwards. But if, having suffered so many things, he was harmed by nothing, although he suffered them not from men, but from him who surpasses all men in wickedness: what place for defense could be left for anyone afterwards, saying: “That one, or that one, harmed and injured me?” For if the devil, who abounds in all wickedness, with every instrument prepared, with all arrows shot, brought forth all evils that happen to man upon the just man’s house and body, and indeed beyond all measure and limit, yet violated this man in nothing, but rather, as I said, helped him; how will he accuse this or that one, as if he suffered injury from them and not from himself? But someone might say: How can he himself be the author of offense and evil, when, stricken by another’s blows, despoiled of goods, violated by some other injury, he might have spoken some insulting word? Assuredly, this man was injured, and greatly injured, yet not by him who did the injury, but by the pusillanimity of his own mind; for what I said before I now repeat: no mortal, even the most wicked, has inflicted heavier and more bitter evils on another than that deadly and destructive demon, who wages eternal hostilities with us; nevertheless, this pernicious demon, though he cast so many and such bitter darts on every side against the man who preceded the times of law and grace, did not prevail.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Many of those who are in similar circumstances are wont, in time of mourning, to grow their hair; but he, on the contrary, shaved it. Why? Because it was necessary to turn the condition into the opposite appearance. Where hair is honored, to be shorn is a sign of mourning. He tore his garments, in appearance lamenting for suffering, but in truth stripping for the contest, and lowering himself henceforth for the struggle, so that as a naked athlete he might wrestle with the adversary.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And he fell to the ground and worshiped the Lord, and said: “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return.”</i><sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This Job struck the devil’s eye, being struck, not striking; he emptied his quiver of arrows, though constantly shot at by him; he endured every kind of temptation, and each with all excess. For those things that seem and are grievous in life are especially these: poverty, sickness, loss of children, uprising of enemies, ingratitude of friends, famine, continuous pains of the flesh, reproaches, slanders, and acquiring an evil reputation; and all these were poured into one body and scattered upon one soul; and, what is more grievous, they attacked him unawares. What I say is of this sort: He who is born of poor parents and raised in such a house, as having exercised and practiced, would easily bear the weight of poverty; but he who is surrounded by so much wealth and abounds in such riches, if he suddenly falls into the opposite condition, would not easily endure the change; for coming upon him unexercised, it appears more difficult. Again, one obscure, born of obscure parents, living in continual contempt, would not be greatly troubled when reproached and insulted. But he who enjoyed such glory, escorted by all, on everyone’s lips, proclaimed everywhere with great publicity, if brought down to dishonor and meanness, would suffer the same as one who from rich suddenly becomes poor. Again, one losing children, even if he loses all, not at one time, has the surviving ones as comfort for the departed, and the grief for the former death, the passion having ceased, if the second occurs after time, this passion comes to him afresh; for it does not come upon a fresh wound, but upon one already asleep and vanished, which greatly cuts short the pain. But this man saw his whole choir snatched away in one moment of time, and by a most bitter death; and the death was violent and untimely. And the time and place added no small increase to the grief; for it was during a feast, and in a house open to strangers, and the house became their tomb. And, what is more wonderful, he endured all these things at once, which makes the trouble double and triple; when the combatant has no comfort from respite, but by the continuous onslaught, greater tumult and disturbance arise, which happened in his case: for the destruction of the sheep and the burning was followed by the seizing of the oxen; and that by the taking of the donkeys, and that by the captivity of the camels and the slaughter of the servants; and that by the loss of the children, and that new and dreadful death, and the most terrible tomb, the same becoming both death and tomb. And the table, which a little before held food, now received cut-up bodies; and bowls and cups, with wine, received blood and crushed limbs. Consider the magnitude of the calamity, and that new shipwreck, and the strange and incredible tragedy.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Perhaps someone at some time lost one son, or a second, or a third; but this man, so many sons and daughters—the man of many children suddenly became childless; and not little by little were his bowels consumed, but suddenly all the fruit was snatched away; and not by the common law of nature, nor having come to old age, but by a violent and untimely death, and all together, and with him not present, not sitting by, so that hearing their last words, he might have some comfort for so bitter a death. But beyond all hope, and knowing nothing of what was happening, suddenly all were overwhelmed, and the house became for them both tomb and snare. Not only untimely death, but many things besides this were grieving him: that all were in their prime, that all were virtuous, that they were affectionate, that all were together, that of both sexes, that not one was left, that not by the common law of nature, that after so great a loss, that conscious of nothing evil in himself or in them, he suffered these things. For each of these is sufficient even by itself to disturb; but when they are seen coming together at once, consider the height of the waves, how great the excess of the storm. But nevertheless he said nothing such as some of the weaker are wont to say: “For this I raised my children, and with all diligence trained them? For this I opened my house to passersby, that after those many runs on behalf of the needy, the naked, the orphans, I should receive such rewards?” But instead of these, upon the calamity of the children, he offered words superior to any sacrifice, which with myriad crowns bound that holy head, and proclaimed more brightly than many trumpets; for he said: “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return. For these things were not mine; I was about to depart from them a little later. For we brought nothing into the world, and it is clear we can take nothing out.”<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup> And before the justifications of his life, which especially disturbed his reasoning. When he looked at his own life, and his conscience shining above the sun, and the multitude of his achievements, he knew he was worthy of crowns, prizes, and countless rewards; but when he looked at all that had happened to the most daring, seeing himself suffering more severely, and unable to find the cause to say why he suffered these things. Therefore, having no cause to assign to the calamity, he flees to the incomprehensibility of God’s dispensation; and referring what happened to what seemed good to Him, he said: “As it pleased the Lord, so it happened.” For I do not think we ought to examine the Lord’s decree; “blessed be the name of the Lord.”<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup> “I will utter nothing unseemly about God,” he says, “but I will judge Him worthy of praise for what He gave at the beginning, and for what He now deemed fit to take away.” With such words the just man silenced the devil; and it is marvelous that even thinking things were taken away by God, he gives thanks, and does not weaken. Do you also do this, and reason with yourself that not man has taken, but God who made you, who cares for you more than you do, and knows what is beneficial—not an enemy, nor a plotter. Help the departed, performing remembrance for them. For if the sacrifice of the spirit purified Job’s children, why do you doubt that if we also offer for the departed, there is some comfort for them? For God is accustomed to grant to some for the sake of others; let us benefit others according to our ability, because every creature follows the Creator; therefore according to what is beneficial He gives to each and takes away, exercising at once our gratitude and endurance. For gratitude for things given was the basis of a second benefit.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>In all these things that happened to him, Job did not sin with his lips before the Lord, and did not give folly to God.</i><sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Just as in statues and images, after we have painted someone, we inscribe below on the base: “So-and-so placed this”; so also here, the author of the book, having painted with words the image of the just man’s soul, as if inscribing below on the base, says: “In all these things Job did not sin with his lips before the Lord.” Do not think that he was silent before men but not before God; for he did not sin even in thought. And what is “with his lips”? Often, carried away by passion, we utter a word, the mind not consenting, but the tongue snatched away by the impulse of grief. But he did not suffer even this; his mind was clean of blasphemy, and his tongue of wicked words. “And he did not give folly to God,” that is, he did not condemn what happened as unjust; he did not say, as many do: “Simply and as chance carries things”; but: “As it pleased the Lord, so it happened.”<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, let us never breathe easy while we are here, but let us always fight, especially in the time of sickness, when pains trouble the soul from all sides, when sufferings besiege, when the devil stands by, urging to say some bitter word. Then especially we must secure ourselves, and fence ourselves with the breastplate of patience and the weapon of thanksgiving. For these are sharp arrows against the devil, this a timely wound; then especially the crowns are bright. For this especially made blessed Job illustrious, this proclaimed him—that in time of temptation, sickness, and poverty, he appeared unwavering and unshaken in mind, to offer words of thanksgiving to God, and that spiritual sacrifice. For his words were a sacrifice, which he said: “The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away,”<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup> and so on; which we also always do, in temptations, in crises, in plots, glorifying God.</p>
