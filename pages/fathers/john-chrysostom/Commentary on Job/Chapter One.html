    <h1>St. John Chrysostom on Job - Chapter One</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CAPUT PRIMUM</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><i>VERS. 1. There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What is the purpose of the prologue, and why did the writer begin in this way? He was about to narrate a life distinguished by virtue, one far surpassing our own condition; so that no one, gazing upon the excess of struggles and endurance, might think it belonged to some foreign and non-human nature, and not a human one, he first shows the nature, so that you might admire the purpose: that he was a man, by nature one of the many, but in virtue far above the many. He stated what is common to nature, to show what is particular to choice: that although he shared the same nature with all, he lived beyond nature and greater than what is human.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">He is also praised from his region, so that from it you might admire what kind of rose has sprouted from a thorn.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Consider, then, the first commendation: that such a shoot was produced by the land of Uz. For in Arabia, where all lived with corrupt morals, where no example of good conduct existed, to find someone so upright and esteemed was not without wonder.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><i>And that man was blameless, upright, fearing God, and turning away from evil.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">The external philosophers, defining man, say: "Man is a rational, mortal animal." But divine Scripture defines as man he who keeps the image [of God] and who is recognized from virtue; but he who confuses and corrupts the divine types and characters, it does not wish to call a man. For if someone has the character of nature but violates it with the wickedness of his choice, he hears from the Prophet: <i>"Man, being in honor, did not understand; he is compared to the senseless beasts, and is become like unto them."<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></i> Here, therefore, Scripture, using its customary manner and showing that nothing so characterizes man as being blameless, just, and godly, from this declares Job to be known, and says that <i>he was a true man</i>. For the wicked are false men, like painted ones. Indeed, the Preacher also confirms this, summarizing all the commandments at the end and referring them to the fear of God as to their head: <i>"The end of the matter, all has been heard: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man."<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Another who prophesied in Jerusalem also says, where he who heard saw no one: <i>"I called, and there was no man; I spoke, and no one answered."<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></i> And we also, not departing from the custom of everyday speech, when we send a servant or son to accomplish some business, are accustomed to say: "Act like a man"; that is, preserve the human condition; endowed with mind and reason, think and act; show by the performance of your function that you are a man. For not from the figure, but from the action, is each one understood; otherwise, by a mere homonymy of the word, it is called what it is called. Only he is a true man who, preserving the image, has in no way obscured the beauty granted by God. Such was Job, true, not feigned, who declared virtue by deeds themselves, not pretended by habit, nor simulated it as in a play.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But what God earlier demanded from Abraham when He said, <i>"Walk before me and be blameless,"<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></i> Scripture now testifies concerning Job; for having said he was true, it adds, <i>without reproach</i>. Consider the word with me, so that you may understand the perfection of the just. Why did it not say "without crime," but "without reproach"? Doubtless because crime is placed among the greatest sins, but reproach in small and minimal ones. Therefore, it says, he not only abstained from the gravest faults, but could not even be pressed by the slightest, which deserve to be censured with reproach rather than accusation, and merit disapproval of deed, but not punishment.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Aquila, for "blameless," rendered "simple"; Symmachus, "innocent"; the former indicating a mind free from all wickedness and artifice of pretense, the latter one directed even to the highest virtue. For he is innocent who lacks no good, who lives a life removed from all wickedness.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">After "blameless," it adds <i>just</i>; for the comprehension and culmination of all things that are honorable and good is justice. For if something of those things which seem to merit praise, separated by itself from the other virtues, is found in someone, it will be imperfect and useless; indeed, if it is found to be contrary, it will be worthy of reproach. For example, someone may excel in intelligence and skill; unless he also meditates on just counsels, he will be cunning, crafty, endowed with corrupt morals, by no means prudent. About such it is said: <i>"They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></i> Again, someone is vigorous in spirit for contests and dangers; unless he also wishes to administer just things, he will be cruel and will bring violence, as they speak: <i>"Let our fury be the law of justice."<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></i> For what is weak is found useless. Someone restrains bodily pleasures, yet will not be temperate if he is avid for money and riches, prodigal, illiberal, or, because of greed for money, wasteful. Finally, any part of justice, torn away from the rest of the body as it were, has no harmony.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But the concord of all those things that merit praise is rightly considered and deemed to be justice. If, however, any of those admirable things is lacking, on that account it limps and is mutilated, and falsely bears the name of justice. For he who is just must first be wise; for how would he do what is necessary and conduct himself fittingly toward all, if he does not understand the order and power of each thing?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Then temperate—for intemperance is injustice; God-loving—for <i>"the godly,"</i> it says, <i>"have thought just things"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup></i>; gentle, beneficent, humane; and, to put it once, the harmony of all things to be done according to right reason fulfills the just man. And this precisely Ezekiel taught us, through whom God says: <i>"And the man who shall be just, he who does justice."<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup></i> Then he describes the just man, composing the perfect and whole virtue from the parts: and first he attaches piety to him, saying: <i>"He has not eaten upon the mountains"</i> (for on the mountains they performed idolatries). Then he says temperance must be present in him: <i>"And he has not defiled his neighbor's wife, nor approached a woman in her menstrual impurity."</i> Then he ascribes meekness and clemency to him: <i>"And he has not oppressed a man by power."</i> He declares him content with his own affairs, saying: <i>"And he has not taken plunder."</i> He also depicts him as merciful and sharing his own, saying: <i>"He has given his bread to the hungry, and covered the naked, and not given his money at interest, and not taken increase."</i> He declares him easy to reconcile and peaceable, so that he can be an excellent arbiter for disputants: <i>"For he has turned his hand away from iniquity and executed true judgment between man and man."</i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For this political and judicial faculty, compared with the other duties of justice, is far more excellent and illustrious; and because it renders to each what is fitting, it is named from justice. Having enumerated all things that are to be done or not, he adapted a common rule and type for all, looking to which, one will err in nothing: <i>"He has walked in my commandments and kept my ordinances, to do them."</i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And from all these bound together and mixed, and as it were formed into one body from many parts and brought into a full harmony, the just man becomes. And having perfected him with so many things, and as it were composing one definition and description from so many, he concludes all with one word and says: <i>"This just man shall live."</i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Since, therefore, we have heard what are the characteristics of the just, let us consider these same things in Job. The just man shows piety toward God; what about Job? Did he not propitiate God with sacrifices each day? Chaste and temperate—as he says: <i>"I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would not gaze upon a virgin."</i> Meek and gentle—and what is gentler than this? Whose servants, on account of his excessive kindness, so hung upon him that they desired even to devour him; for they said: <i>"Who will give us to be filled with his flesh?"</i> Merciful and sharing—and who is equal to Job in this? Whose door stood open to all comers, and no one departed with an empty bosom. The just man judges justly between disputants; here also Job is permitted to boast and say: <i>"I sought out the judgment which I did not know, and broke the jaws of the unjust."</i> The just man will harm no one, but Job even calls down a curse upon himself: <i>"If I have lifted my hand against the orphan, let my shoulder fall from its joint."</i> Since, therefore, Job fulfilled every part of virtue with excess, he is called blameless and just.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Thus Job was just: not having one part of virtue in him, but possessing every human virtue whole and complete, not abstaining from this evil thing but clinging to another. Thus we also call that a just weight which is equal everywhere: not if it can balance gold with one scale, but lead contrariwise; but that which provides equality in all materials, and again a measure equal everywhere. Thus Job was just, equal everywhere. For he preserved this equality not only in money, but also in all other things, nowhere exceeding the measure. For no one could say that he loved equality in money, but in intercourse with neighbors exceeded the measure, living arrogantly and contemptuously; but he also avoided this, saying: <i>"If I have despised the judgment of my manservant or maidservant when they contended with me, what then shall I do when God rises up? Or did not he who made me in the womb make him also?"</i> Therefore, is it not the greatest injustice to be boastful and proud? For as we call greedy one who wishes to take what belongs to others and is not content with his own, so we call proud one who demands more from a neighbor than is owed to a man; when someone places himself in all honor but wishes to dishonor another, this happens from nothing else than injustice. For this is evident because God made one substance of all, gave all things common and equal to neighbor. How, then, do you cast him out and deprive him of the honor which God gave, not allowing him to be a participant with you, but making everything yours, impoverishing him not in riches but in glory? God bestowed one substance on both and the preeminence of substance to both; for that <i>"Let us make man"</i> is common to the whole race. How, then, do you cast him out from the paternal substance, reducing him to the utmost poverty, and appropriating what is common as your own?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But the blessed Job was not such, therefore he also said: <i>"I have not despised the judgment of my manservant or maidservant."</i> Therefore, the writer, calling him just, presents him not as having particular justice, which is seen in contracts and lawsuits, but as having universal virtue, according to that which is written: <i>"The law is not laid down for the just."<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup></i> He adds that he is also godly, to show that he was perfect both toward men and toward God; for justice is toward men, piety toward God. See how the virtues follow one another and strengthen each other: a good life causes God to be known, and the knowledge of God becomes the guardian of life. Hence Job, because he was just, was therefore godly; and because he always had God before his eyes, for that reason he pursued justice justly, for the sake of the good itself, and not for something else. Nor is it possible to become just without first becoming blameless. Therefore, the true man comes first—he who is not clothed with a fiction and appearance of reverence, but pursues virtue in truth and deed, and is formed according to it. Followed by the blameless—for the genuine worker of virtue guards himself even from things that seem small. To him again follows he who is named from perfect justice, the just man, perfected in every kind of virtue. Then the godly enters more splendidly after these, shining equally with good works and right doctrines. To these is attached <i>"abstaining from every evil thing,"</i> which itself leaves no excess; for it is not said that he abstained from this evil but not from that, or restrained himself from many but was conquered by few, but he wished to touch no wickedness.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">It is not enough only to abstain from evils, but the working of good must also be present. For the idleness of virtue knows how to procure punishment, not only the activity of wickedness. Since also those who did not feed the hungry, because they did not exercise mercy, are delivered to eternal punishment. Hence we learn that abstaining from evils is not the beginning of salvation for us, unless the possession of good and the activity of virtue are also present. But you see how the law of the divine Spirit gathered the praise of this man in a few words: for having called him true according to creation, describing as it were his homeland and ancestors, and blameless according to action, just according to equity and the sharing of his possessions with others, and also according to rendering right judgments in cases, and what is foremost of all, godly according to faith and hatred of idols, abstaining from every evil thing according to the most ardent enmity with all evils. And, to sum up, he did nothing worthy of complaint; but he observed the just things toward men and pursued the things pertaining to religion with a pure mind, doing all things according to God, genuinely pious toward the divine.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">VERS. 2–3. And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">First he stated the virtue, and then the things given by God. For from virtue these came long ago: good children, I mean, and many children. For it is said: <i>"There shall not be a barren man or a barren woman in your land."<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></i> But Abraham was without children for this reason, so that you might learn that these are not truly the rewards of virtue, but others; yet for this He promised them, condescending.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">We gather that marriage is no impediment to virtue; otherwise it would have been a hindrance also to Job. But indeed this bond did not hinder the just man from running rightly; so that this also some allege in vain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">VERS. 3. And his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys at pasture, and a very great household; and his works were great upon the earth.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">See, then, him possessing wealth of a more rustic kind; for he did not list loans and interest, nor houses adorned with golden ceilings; whence it was not difficult for him to be able to do good. But he lists sheep, oxen, and things from seasons and agriculture, from which he supplied the needy. For as I said, Scripture presents to us as king one who does not boast of precious material, but is content with things measured to need. It does not mention horses, nor chariots glued with gold, nor treasuries of silver and gold, nor precious stones, nor other things that inflame the disease of those covetous of riches, but things that least exceed necessity. For although he had children, he remained unwounded by money, considering abundance and plenty as the lack of desire and ambition, not enslaved to passions.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Since it is marked with an obelus, <i>"and a very great household,"</i> it must be known that whatever is marked with an obelus is not in the Hebrew, but was added by the Seventy for clarity only. Indeed, to transfer the description of animals of different kind to a spiritual theory is superfluous and belongs to the art of interpreting dreams.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">VERS. 3. And that man was noble, greatest of the men of the East.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Symmachus rendered: <i>"Most illustrious of all the Orientals."</i> He was, it says, more splendid and more eminent than all, and he had notable and illustrious ancestors to number, but none of these puffed him up into arrogance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">VERS. 4. And his sons went and made a feast in the house of each on his day; and they sent and invited their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Having concordant virtue, they were also without strife in sensible things, going to one another, and not far, nor making associations with others; they also included their sisters, witnesses of their sobriety. For they did not invite other women to their parties and dinners, but included their sisters, which is a clear sign of temperance and modesty. But the devil found their harmony and association an opportunity for a sudden plot against them, to overthrow all at once in the house of the eldest brother.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">VERS. 5. And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job sent and purified them, rising up early.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">You see a purification not Mosaic but apostolic, wiping their mind, not their body, with prayers. Some say that the priests of old were also, like Melchizedek, not ordained by hands; this, then, indicates he sent.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">VERS. 6. And it came to pass on a certain day, behold, the angels of God came to stand before the Lord, and the devil came among them.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">God, invisible to all created nature, without quantity, immense, everywhere present, standing by all, encompassing all, and there is no place outside His dominion, is present to each as is fitting: to the holy angels, as holy, sending secret voices of commands; to the wicked one, as wicked, permitting temptations of men to be allowed. For the devil can do nothing except what is allowed by God. And he does not stand in the heavenly places—far be it! for from there he was cast out: <i>"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, who didst rise in the morning?"<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup></i> He is said to stand with the angels, as he himself is also in the places of God's dominion, and awaits to be permitted or allowed to make temptations against men; not fulfilling some liturgy to God, but since he was brought to this by transgression and wickedness, and is mad against us. He is allowed by Him who rightly administers our affairs to bring upon us temptations as far as we are able to bear. Scripture, having depicted these things, brought forth the discourse with a figurative representation for our understanding.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The phrase <i>"And it came to pass on a certain day"</i> is instead: "A day came on which the theater was opened, and the athlete descended to the wrestling." And since the holy angels care for us and look after us, and the devil works against our salvation, and concerning the same matter, i.e., man, they oppose one another, they are said to stand together, God observing the things being done.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">We are conquered or overcome, not because of the power of adversaries or the weakness of allies, but because of our own choice. For as each draws us to themselves, the holy angels persuading good, the accursed demons evil, our choice, endowed with free will, proceeds to whichever part it wishes. For neither are we compelled by Him who honored us with free will, nor does the devil possess any coercive force against us; but according to choice, adhering to angels or demons, we either act rightly or sin.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">VERS. 7. And the Lord said to the devil, "From where do you come?"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Why indeed is the devil present with the angelic service, and does the unclean spirit dare to speak in the midst of the holy spirits? Neither the angels nor Satan stand before God bodily; but every ministry is called a standing. As a creature of God, therefore, the devil is commanded to do what is fitting; for though he has shaken off the reins of the divine command by his will, he is nevertheless under the yoke of servitude, and is commanded to do what is ordered as an executioner. And as among us rulers, when they summon someone with honor, send honorable men; but when they drag someone with disgrace, send cruel soldiers; so God sends ministering angels for salvation to the holy, but when someone is to be punished, He commits this to evil powers. Hence Paul delivers the one who sinned at Corinth to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, and others likewise, that they might not blaspheme.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">VERS. 7. And the devil answered the Lord and said, "I have gone round the earth and walked through what is under heaven, and I am present."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">By bringing forth the discourse in the form of question and answer, Scripture more fully described the truth and cuts off every pretext of the shameless. For what it says the devil said to God, he did not say but thought; for such boldness did not belong to him. And by saying he has traversed all places, first he accuses himself, that he has no fixed abode, but wanders through all regions like a vagabond, waging war against the human race. Then we learn that the world is filled both with angels and demons, and that both are under divine power, and that angels come to God to receive commands; but the devil will be able to do nothing according to his pleasure unless he receives permission from above. For though he has thrown off the reins and is outside serving God, yet fear is placed like a bridle, and he is not allowed to use his own power. But see, those come as servants, reporting what is done; this one has nothing to say. Heaven, therefore, is inaccessible to this wicked demon, and he is not present everywhere at the same time, but in succession.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And <i>"what is under heaven,"</i> it says, to indicate also the desert, and whatever is subject to heaven, and the aerial region. He wanders also the uninhabited, perhaps by some dispensation of God, so that he may not trouble our race continually.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">VERS. 8. And the Lord said to him, "Have you considered my servant Job?"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From this we learn that God wished Job to be tempted, as having a noble athlete; for He questions the devil so that he might give him an occasion for the contest, but He Himself did not wish to provide the occasion, lest He seem ambitious. See how the manner of discourse is gradually exposed: for no longer does it show him making a report of his words, but that <i>"Have you considered?"</i> as a voice the narrative has given. God, therefore, permitted the devil to know even without a voice, that his wicked plan and action did not escape Him. And as it were He speaks to him, <i>"From where do you come?"</i> not wishing to learn the whereabouts of the wicked one (for how could He, who has the knowledge of all things present?), but He is accustomed often to present what is said in the form of a question, as also in the Gospels the Lord brings questions concerning Cleopas: <i>"What are these words which you exchange with each other?"<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup></i> And who would dare to say that He who fashioned the hearts of each one by Himself<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> needs questioning? Such also is, <i>"How many loaves do you have?"<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup></i> and elsewhere, confirming His resurrection, He said, <i>"Have you anything here to eat?"<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup></i> and concerning Lazarus He asked, <i>"Where have you laid him?"<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup></i> having anticipated the report and foretold his death. In the same way here, saying to the devil, <i>"From where do you come?"</i> and <i>"Have you considered my servant?"</i> He does not put forth words of ignorance, nor does He wish to be taught the dwelling of the hostile one, but shows that very one as the accuser of his own cruelty. For wickedness is naturally wont to wound itself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">VERS. 8. <i>"For there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil."</i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What harm is it to be despised by all men and the whole world, when the Lord of the angels praises and proclaims? On the other hand, what help is it to be praised by all inhabitants of land and sea, if God is silent about our praises? This, therefore, let us everywhere look to, that God may proclaim us. If this be, we are superior to all, even in poverty, sickness, and in all sensible evils. Since even blessed Job, sitting on the dunghill, surrounded with the pus of wounds, gushing with countless springs of worms, suffering those unbearable things, spat upon by servants, plotted against by friends, enemies, and wife, cast down into poverty, famine, and that incurable disease, was more blessed than all. How? Since God praised him, using those words: <i>"a just man, blameless, true, godly."</i> For how did he not surpass all on earth, God of all bearing witness to him, in saying <i>"blameless, a true man,"</i> having incomparable virtue, keeping the just things toward men blamelessly, and precisely pursuing piety toward God? And that the devil, considering his circumstances, held no small wonder concerning him. But why indeed does he change the order of praises here? Perhaps he does this indifferently, or perhaps he arranges the praise according to the nature and harmony of things. For first, every man is true according to the reason of creation; then thus blameless according to the manner of life; but here, because of the battle with the devil, he puts blameless before true. For virtue knows how to fight wickedness, and the justice of character becomes the sharpest arrow against the envious. Then he joins the true to the blameless, to show that nature also agrees with character, and choice adorning the nobility of nature.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The wicked one repented that he had announced the first things badly. "Badly," he says, "I shot; I did not hit the mark; the arrow wandered." I said that men had taken captive the oxen and donkeys; Job could reason: "Men have wronged me; what is this to God? Shall I ascribe the injustice of men to God? Others are the wrongdoers, and another will be the blasphemed?" Therefore, to turn his mind from men to God, he says: <i>"Fire fell from heaven."</i> Aquila and Theodotion said, <i>"fire of God."</i> You cannot say, "Enemies kindled from above; revile the one who wronged you, blaspheme the one who made war. Why does he serve Him? Why worship the one who consumes your possessions?" Do not think the blows are human, hearing "they took captive." From above God wages war against you, from heaven. And it is clear, so that fire descending from heaven consumed the sheep. See how great the devil's power is, how he stirred so many nations, or fashioned demons into enemies—consider for me the ease. Not thinking it to be truly fire (for he cannot create), but thus he showed burning all; or if it was truly fire, he stirred this also from existing nature, God permitting.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">VERS. 18–19. <i>"While he was yet speaking, another came and said, 'Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking in their eldest brother's house, and behold, a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you.'"</i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">That ruin so overwhelmed the children that the body of each was to be committed to burial, and they could not be distinguished. He added <i>"eating and drinking,"</i> that is, in the very moment of enjoyment.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For after he had applied every temptation and stripped him of resources but had not taken away virtue, he then proceeds against nature, tears the saplings from the root, plucks the fruit by force, to cause pain to the parent. And see how the narrative is sprinkled with irony and tends to deceptions and fallacies, so that it might break even the spirit of a strong man. <i>"A great wind,"</i> he says, <i>"came from the wilderness,"</i> in which even now the judge of the cause is; for the wind obeys not men but God. And he did not say: <i>"The house fell on those inside"</i>; but he announces what avails to excite pain: <i>"upon your children,"</i> he says, so that hearing the name of children, his spirit might be moved with pity and receive the sense of the common evil, and mourning say: "Woe is me, bereft of a crowd of children, I have suddenly fallen into childlessness; it were better not to have had children than to have had them on condition of receiving the loss and tearing of them." For former peace, tranquillity, and happiness render the calamity more bitter. That <i>"I alone have escaped"</i> could have some place in other cases, but here greatly increases the pain: if, with children dead by such a fate, the sole survivor is the one who brings the news. Therefore, the devil seems to me to have been the messenger of these things, and the same author and architect of evils, coming clad in various forms and presenting artful narratives. Thus he ceases not to come, speaks more harshly, and reserves dangers that have greater bitterness to the end, so that the strength of mind, weakened first by lighter evils, might not afterward sustain the assault of greater. That none of the servants remained to announce these things can be understood hence: for how could the house, with its four sides shaken by wind, preserve one? Likewise, how in each calamity only one escaped, as if saved unharmed for this cause? But doubtless the same was the author of evils and the messenger. For no one is found more savage than he; therefore he feared to give the business of such evil deeds to others. He devises a variety of attacks, being skilled in crime and wickedness, nor does he think anything moderate, so that thus he might gradually shake the defenses and fortifications of the mind; and as applying machines to walls, he deceives the besieged, and envies the saint with varied and manifold kind of plotting, in a certain order, when he brings dangers from all sides.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Do not marvel that he tore his garments and shaved his head; for he was a father, and a loving father; and it was necessary both to show the sympathy of nature and the philosophy of the mind. For if he had not done this, perhaps someone might have thought this philosophy to be insensitivity. Therefore, he shows both the bowels and the precision of philosophy, and though grieving, he was not overthrown.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do not think the matter a defeat; this especially shows the victory. For if he had not done this, someone would have said that God had made him insensible in passions. But now he shows that even while grieving he philosophizes; truly he had built his soul upon his rock. The rain descended—for <i>"fire,"</i> it says, <i>"fell from heaven and devoured all the flocks"</i>; the rivers came—the frequent, continuous, and successive messengers of calamities, one speaking the loss of the shepherds, another of the camels, another of the children; the winds blew—the bitter words of the wife, for she said, <i>"Say a word against the Lord and die"</i>; and the house did not fall, the soul was not tripped up, the just man did not blaspheme, but gave thanks. And yet the adversary was the devil, wicked, savage, never reconciled to human nature, but having undertaken war and battle without truce against our race; and not simply was he angry, but he set all machines in motion and applied every magical device. And not even thus did he refute the courage of the just, but the noble man laughed at his arrows and bore the unbearable war bravely, and this not under grace, but before the Old Testament and before grace. And he showed that not the nature of temptations, but the negligence of the indolent, causes the fall; for tribulation works patience<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>. And as strong trees, when the force of winds falls upon them and shakes them from all sides, does not uproot but makes them stronger by these assaults; so a firm soul, living with reverence, the onslaughts of tribulations do not trip up, but anoint it for greater endurance, and cannot harm human virtue.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">What is human virtue? Not money, so that you fear poverty; nor health of body, so that you fear sickness; nor the opinion of the many, so that you fear evil reputation; nor simply living at random, so that death becomes fearful to you; nor freedom, so that you flee slavery; but the precision of true doctrines and correctness of life. These not even the devil himself will be able to plunder, if the possessor guards them with due precision; and this the most wicked and savage demon knows. For on this account he despoiled Job of possessions, not to make him poor, but to compel some blasphemous word; he also lacerated his body with sores, not to cast him into sickness, but to pluck out the virtue of the soul. But yet, when he had applied all machines, made him suddenly needy from wealthy, and (what seems to us most fearful of all) bereaved him of all his children, having surpassed the savagery of torturers who stand around judges' tribunals, he cruelly tore his whole body (for not so do their nails pierce the sides of deserters as the mouths of worms lacerated Job's flesh), and when he had produced evil opinion about him in the minds of men (for the friends present said to his face: <i>"In no way are your punishments equal to your sins"<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup></i>, and produced many other speeches full of accusation); finally, although he gave the man, cast out from city and home, no other city, but set the dwelling of dung and filth for city and home; nevertheless, not only did he afflict him with no harm or evil, but even from those very things which he secretly plotted against him, he made him more illustrious. And when he had cast him down from the possession of so many goods, he not only did not despoil him of goods, but even amassed for him much richer wealth of virtue; exercised by greater contests and greater dangers, he became bolder afterward. For if, having suffered so much, he was harmed in nothing, although he suffered not from men but from him who surpasses all men in wickedness, what place for defense can be left afterward for one saying, "This or that man has wronged and harmed me"? For if the devil, who abounds in all wickedness, with every instrument prepared, having shot all arrows, brought forth all evils that befall man upon the just man's house and body, and that beyond all measure, yet violated this man in nothing, but rather, as I said, helped him, how will he accuse this or that, as suffering injury from them and not from himself? But someone will say: How can he himself be the author of offense and evil, when wronged by others, deprived of goods, violated by some other injury, he said some contumelious word? Surely this one is harmed, and greatly harmed, not by the one who did the injury, but by the small-mindedness of his own mind. For what I said before I now repeat: no mortal, even the most wicked, has inflicted on another heavier and more bitter evils than that deadly and destructive demon, who wages eternal enmities with us; nevertheless, this pernicious demon, though he cast so and so many sharp darts on every side against the man who preceded the times of Law and Grace, harmed him in nothing. From this history, many of those who are in equal calamities receive consolation, learning that human affairs are not administered without God, but that the good are afflicted not as deserving evils, but that they may become more illustrious.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do not wonder, therefore, that he tore his garments and shaved his head; for he was a father, and a loving father; and it was necessary both to show the sympathy of nature and the philosophy of the mind. For if he had not done this, perhaps someone might have thought this philosophy to be insensitivity. Therefore, he shows both the bowels and the precision of philosophy, and though grieving, he was not overthrown.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">VERS. 20–21. <i>"And he fell upon the ground and worshiped, and said, 'Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there...'"</i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This Job struck the devil's eye, being struck, not striking; he emptied his quiver of arrows, being shot at continually by him; he endured every kind of temptation, and each with all excess. For those things that are and seem grievous in life—poverty, sickness, loss of children, uprising of enemies, ingratitude of friends, famine, continual pains of flesh, reproaches, calumnies, and acquiring an evil reputation—all these were poured into one body and scattered upon one soul; and what is more grievous, they attacked him unawares. What I say is of this sort: He who is born from poor parents and raised in such a house, as having exercised and practiced, would easily bear the weight of poverty; but he who is surrounded with so much money and rejoices in such wealth, if suddenly changed to the opposite, would not easily endure the change; for appearing suddenly to the unexercised, it seems more difficult. Again, an obscure man, born from obscure parents, living in continual contempt, would not be greatly troubled if reviled and insulted; but he who enjoyed such glory, guarded by all, on everyone's lips, proclaimed everywhere with great celebrity, if brought down to dishonor and meanness, would suffer the same as one suddenly become poor from rich. He who loses children, even if he loses all, not at one time, has the consolation of the survivors for the departed; and if the pain of the first death has ceased, the second, occurring after time, becomes a new wound; for it does not come to a fresh scar, but to one already asleep and vanished, which greatly cuts short the pain. But he saw his whole chorus snatched away in one moment of time, by a most bitter kind of death; and the death was violent and untimely. And the time and place added no small addition to the mourning; for at the time of a banquet, in a house open to strangers, the house itself became their tomb. And what is more wonderful, he bore all these together, which makes the difficulties double and triple when the combatant has no solace from a respite, but by the continuous onslaught the tumult becomes greater and the confusion larger, which happened to this man: for the destruction of the sheep and the burning was followed by the seizure of the oxen; and that by the taking of the donkeys, and that by the captivity of the camels and the slaughter of the servants; and that by the loss of the children, and that fearful and new death, and the most dreadful tomb, the same becoming both death and tomb. And the table, where now they dined, now receiving cut-up bodies; and bowls and cups, with wine, receiving blood and crushed limbs. Consider the magnitude of the calamity, and that new shipwreck, and the foreign and paradoxical tragedy.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Perhaps someone else lost one son, or a second, or a third; but pitiably, so many sons and daughters, and the man of many children suddenly became childless; and not little by little were his bowels consumed, but suddenly all the fruit was snatched away; and not by the common law of nature, nor having come to old age, but by untimely and violent death, and all together, and with him not present, not sitting beside, so that even hearing last words he might have some consolation of so bitter a death. But beyond all hope, and knowing nothing of what was happening, suddenly all were overwhelmed, and the house became tomb and snare for them. Not only untimely death, but many things besides grieved him: that all were in their prime, all virtuous, friendly, all together, of both sexes, not one left, not by the common law of nature, that after so great a loss, conscious of nothing evil in himself or in them, he suffered these things. For each of these is sufficient even by itself to disturb; when they appear running together, consider the height of the waves, how great the excess of the storm. But nevertheless he said nothing such as some of the weaker are wont to say: "For this I nourished children, and exercised with all precision? For this I opened my house to passersby, that after those many runs for the needy, for the naked, for orphans, I should receive these rewards?" But instead of these, upon the calamity of the children, he brought forth words more precious than any sacrifice, which with myriad crowns bound that holy head, and proclaimed more splendidly than many trumpets; for he said: <i>"Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return."</i> For they were not mine; I was about to depart from them a little later; for we brought nothing into the world, and it is clear we can carry nothing out. And before those words he gave thanks: <i>"The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away."</i> What is more precious than this sacrifice? Having learned from his mother, from nature, from the very creation, that he brought nothing and will take nothing out, he accepted the trial nobly, and before the words of philosophy he placed the sacrifice of thanksgiving, offering the first-fruits of his words to God. Thus the head of the family, sitting on the dunghill, became a sacrifice and altar, priest and victim, offering thanksgiving to God. And that which the priests accomplish with many victims and libations, this man accomplished with words, offering the sacrifice of praise. And to show that he did not philosophize from insensitivity, he also uttered words of nature; for he did not immediately say, <i>"Naked I came..."</i> but first gave thanks. But many of the simpler sort, hearing the words, <i>"The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away,"</i> think they are from a soul hard and made of stone, and that the one enduring such things is not a man. But if he had been insensible, he would not have torn his garments, nor sat on the dunghill, nor shaved his head. Therefore, to show that he was not insensible, he does these things; and to teach that he does not bear these things from insensitivity but from philosophy, he gives thanks. For otherwise he would have been like a stone, not like a man; but now he is shown both a man and thankful. For to give thanks in such circumstances is a proof of much philosophy.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, even now some think the words, <i>"Naked I came..."</i> are from a hard soul. But consider: not even when his body was consumed with worms, not when his wealth was lost, not when his children perished, did he blaspheme; but by giving thanks he choked the devil. Yet he had another thought that especially disturbed his reasoning: when he looked at his life and conscience shining above the sun, and the multitude of successes, he knew he was worthy of crowns, prizes, and myriad rewards; but when he looked at all that had happened to him, and saw himself suffering more severely than the most daring, and could not find the cause for which he suffered these things, therefore, having no cause to assign to the calamity, he flees to the incomprehensibility of God's dispensation; and referring what happened to what seemed good to Him, he said: <i>"As it pleased the Lord, so it has happened."</i> For I do not think, he says, that the Lord's purpose should be examined; <i>"blessed be the name of the Lord."</i> I will utter nothing unfitting about God; but I will deem worthy of praise both for what He then gave in the beginning, and for what He now has seen fit to take away. With such words the just man stabbed the devil. And wonderful, that even thinking things were taken away by God, he gives thanks and does not weaken. Do you also do this, and reckon with yourself that not man has taken, but God who made you, who cares for you more than you do, and knows what is beneficial, not an enemy nor a plotter. Help the departed, performing remembrance for them. For if the sacrifice of the Spirit cleansed Job's children, why doubt that some comfort comes to them from us offering for the departed? For God is wont to grant to others through the prayers of others. Let us benefit in the sensible, that every creature follows the Creator; for according to what is beneficial He both gives and takes away from each, exercising at once our gratitude and endurance. For gratitude for things granted was the basis of a second benefaction.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">VERS. 22. <i>"In all this Job did not sin with his lips before the Lord, nor did he give folly to God."</i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">As in statues and images, after we have depicted someone, we inscribe below on the base, "So-and-so placed this"; so also here, the author of the book, having delineated the image of the just man's soul with words, as inscribing below on a base, says: <i>"In all this Job did not sin with his lips before the Lord."</i> And do not think that he was silent before men but not before God; but he did not sin even in thought. What is <i>"with his lips"?</i> Often, seized by passion, we utter a word, the mind not assenting, but the tongue carried away by the impulse of grief. But he did not suffer even this, but his mind was clean of blasphemy, and his tongue clean of wicked words. <i>"Nor did he give folly to God"</i>—that is, he did not condemn what happened as unjust; he did not say, as many, "Mere chance carries things along"; but <i>"As it pleased the Lord, so it has happened."</i></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, let us not ever breathe easily while we are here, but always box, especially in the time of sickness, when pains trouble the soul from all sides, when griefs besiege, when the devil stands by, urging to say some bitter word. Then especially we must fortify ourselves and fence ourselves with the breastplate of endurance and the weapon of thanksgiving. For these are heavy arrows against the devil, this a timely wound; then especially are the crowns bright. Since this especially made the blessed Job illustrious, this proclaimed him: to appear unturned and unshaken in mind in time of temptation, sickness, and poverty, to bring forth words of thanksgiving to God, and that spiritual host—for his words which he said were a sacrifice: <i>"The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away,"</i> etc., which we also always do in temptations, crises, plots, glorifying God.</p>
