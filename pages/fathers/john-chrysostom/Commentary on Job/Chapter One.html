    <h1>Chapter One</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job.”</i><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></span> What is the purpose of the prologue, and why did the writer begin in this way? He was about to narrate a virtuous life, one far surpassing our own condition; so that indeed, lest anyone, looking upon the excess of the struggles and the endurance, should think it to be some foreign nature, and not human, he first shows the nature, so that you may marvel at the intention, that he was a man, by nature one of the many, but in virtue higher than the many. He stated the commonality of nature, in order to show the distinctiveness of his choice, that sharing the same nature with all, he lived beyond nature, and greater than is human. And he proclaims him also from the country, so that from there too you may marvel, what kind of rose blossomed from a thorn. See, then, the first praise: that the land of Uz produced such a shoot. For to be so excellent in Arabia, where all were corrupt, where there was no example of good order, this was marvelous.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And that man was blameless, upright, fearing God, and turning away from every evil thing.”</i><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></span> The philosophers outside define man: “Man is a rational, mortal living being.” But the divine Scripture defines as a man the one who preserves the image of God, and is known by virtue; the one who confuses and corrupts the divine patterns and characteristics it does not wish even to call a man. For if someone has the characteristic of nature, but dishonors it with the wickedness of his choice, he hears from the Prophet: <i>“Man, being in honor, did not understand; he is compared to the senseless beasts, and is become like unto them.”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></i> Here then, using its customary manner, Scripture also shows that nothing so characterizes a man as being blameless, upright, God-fearing; hence it also reveals Job as known, and says he was a true man. For the wicked are false men, like painted ones. Therefore also the Preacher, summing up all the commandments at the end into the fear of God, says: <i>“Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.”<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></i> And another prophesying in Jerusalem, since he saw none who listened, said: <i>“I came, and there was no man; I called, and there was none to answer.”<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></i> And we also, according to common custom, when we send a servant or a son on some business, are accustomed to say to him: “As a man, attend to the business,” that is, preserve the human condition, as sensible, as having reason, think thus, act thus, show by your action that you truly are a man. For not from the outward appearance, but from the action, each one is known; if not, he is called so only in name, as it is said. But only he is a true man who preserves the image, who does not obscure the God-given beauty, such as Job: true, not counterfeit, showing the virtue of man by deeds, not pretending by appearance, or acting it out theatrically. What God previously demanded of Abraham, saying: <i>“Be well-pleasing before me, and be blameless,”<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></i> this now Scripture testifies concerning Job: for having said he was true, it adds that he was also blameless. And examine the word for me, that you may know the great precision of the righteous man: why did it not say “unaccused,” but “blameless”? Because accusation is placed for the greatest sins, but blame for small and least things. Not only, it says, did he abstain from the heaviest evils, but he did not even allow himself to be caught by the lightest, which are rather a matter of blame than accusation, and bring only condemnation, not punishment. Moreover, Aquila and Symmachus, instead of “blameless,” one rendered “simple,” the other “without blemish”; the one hinting at the guilelessness and genuineness of the righteous man, the other at his being trained with precision for virtue. For “without blemish” is he who is lacking in none of the good things, who conducts his life without stumbling from all evil. Then after “blameless,” it adds that he was “upright.” The gathering and union of all good and noble things is righteousness. For if any of the things that seem to be praised were to exist by itself, apart from the rest of virtue, it is imperfect and useless, or rather often found to be contrary and blameworthy. For example, someone is intelligent and prudent, if he does not plan just things, he is wicked and malicious, not prudent. Concerning such it is said: <i>“They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.”<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></i> Again, another is brave in contests and dangers; if he does not wish to act justly, he is cruel and violent, like those saying: <i>“Let our strength be the law of justice.”<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></i> For the weak is proven useless. If someone rules over bodily pleasures, but would not be temperate if he were a lover of money, greedy, prodigal, not liberal, reckless in desire for money. In general, every part of righteousness, cut off from the rest of the body, is nothing. But the harmony and union of all praiseworthy things is reasonably considered one righteousness; if any of the admirable things were missing, it limps in that respect and is mutilated, and the name of righteousness is falsified. For the righteous man is necessarily first wise; for how could he do what is fitting and relate appropriately to all, unless he understood the rank and power of each? Then he is temperate, for licentiousness is injustice; God-loving, for <i>“the devout,” it says, “have planned just things,”<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup></i> gentle, humane, beneficent; and in sum, the concord of all things to be done according to right reason fulfills the righteous man. And this Ezekiel accurately taught us, through whom God says: <i>“But the man who shall be righteous, who does righteousness.”<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup></i> Then he delineates the righteous man, composing the complete and whole virtue from the parts: and first he attaches piety to him, saying: <i>“He has not eaten upon the mountains,”<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup></i> for on the mountains they performed idolatries. Then he says temperance must be present in him: <i>“And he has not defiled his neighbor’s wife, and has not come near to a woman in her impurity.”<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></i> Then he also ascribes to him mildness and equity: <i>“And he has not oppressed any man.”<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup></i> To this he shows him to be honest, saying: <i>“He has not taken plunder.”<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup></i> And he portrays him as merciful and sharing, saying: <i>“His bread he has given to the hungry, and has clothed the naked, his money he has not given upon usury, and increase he has not taken.”<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup></i> And he shows him to be fair and peaceable, as also able to arbitrate excellently between disputants: <i>“For from injustice, he says, he has turned back his hand, and he has executed righteous judgment between man and his neighbor.”<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup></i> For this is the special and most conspicuous thing, combined with all the other accomplishments of righteousness: the political and judicial habit, rendering to each what is fitting, whence it is also named from justice. Having gone through everything, both what is to be done and what not, he applied the common rule and pattern to all, looking to which, one will err in nothing. <i>“In my commandments he has walked, and my judgments he has kept to do them.”<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup></i> And all these bound together and mixed, and held as one many-membered and fully harmonious body, becomes the righteous man. And having thus perfected him through so many things, and having composed one boundary and definition for him from so many, he enclosed all into one name, and says: <i>“This righteous man shall surely live.”<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup></i> Since, then, we have heard what things characterize the righteous man, let us also consider in comparison the things concerning Job. The righteous man is pious; and what of Job? Did he not propitiate God with sacrifices on each occasion? Temperate, and he also: <i>“I made a covenant with my eyes,” he says, “that I should not think upon a virgin.”<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup></i> Mild and equitable; and what is gentler than he? Whose servants, because of his exceeding goodness, so hung upon him, as even to desire a little to devour him; for they said: <i>“Who will give us of his flesh to be satisfied?”<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup></i> Merciful and sharing; and who here is equal to Job? Was not the door open to every comer, and did anyone go out with an empty bosom? That the righteous can arbitrate justly between disputants, here also Job can boast, and say: <i>“The cause which I knew not I searched out, and I broke the jaws of the wicked.”<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup></i> The righteous will wrong no one, but Job even curses himself: <i>“If I lifted my hand against an orphan, then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder.”<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup></i> Since, then, Job perfected every part of virtue with excellence, therefore he is called blameless and upright. Thus also Job was upright, not having a part of virtue in him, but every human virtue whole and complete, not abstaining from this evil while cleaving to another. Thus also we call a balance just, that which is equal everywhere, not if it can weigh gold equally, but lead oppositely; but that which provides equality in all substances, and again a measure equal everywhere. Thus also Job was upright, equal everywhere: for he preserved this equality not only concerning money, but also in all other things, nowhere exceeding the measure. For one could not say that in money he cherished fairness, but in association with neighbors he exceeded the measure, but living humbly and not overbearing, he also fled this, saying: <i>“If I despised the cause of my manservant or maidservant when they contended with me; or was I not also as they?<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup></i> Is this also the greatest injustice, to be arrogant and haughty? For just as we call a covetous one desiring to take the things of others, and not content with his own, so we call arrogant when one demands more than is due to a man from his neighbor, when someone places himself in all honor, but wishes to dishonor another; and this happens from nothing else than injustice. That this is injustice, God made one substance for all, gave all things common and equal for the neighbor. How then do you cast him out and deprive him of the honor which God gave? Not allowing him to be a sharer, but making all yours, not in money, but making him poor in glory. God granted one substance to both, and the preeminence of substance: for <i>“Let us make man”<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup></i> is common to the whole race. How then do you cast him out of the paternal substance, reducing him to extreme meanness, and appropriating the common? But the blessed Job was not such, therefore he said: <i>“If I despised the cause of my manservant or maidservant.”<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup></i> Therefore also the writer, calling him upright, presents him, not as having partial righteousness, in transactions and lawsuits, but as having universal virtue, according to that about which it is written: <i>“The law is not made for a righteous man.”<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup></i> And he adds that he was also God-fearing, to show that he was perfect both towards men and towards God; for righteousness is towards men, but godliness towards God. See, the virtues follow one another and strengthen each other; for a good life makes one know God, and the knowledge of God becomes the guardian of life. Whence also Job, since he was upright, therefore also God-fearing; and since he always had God before his eyes, therefore he also pursued righteousness justly, for the sake of the good itself, and not for some other reason. But one cannot become righteous without first becoming blameless. Therefore, first stands the true man, who does not wear a pretense and show of piety, but pursues virtue in truth and reality, and is formed according to it; and after him follows the blameless one; for the genuine worker of virtue guards himself even from things seeming small. And after him follows the one named from perfect righteousness, the upright one, perfected in every form of virtue; then the God-fearing one enters more brilliantly after these, distinguished both by good works and right beliefs. To these is added: “turning away from every evil thing,” which itself leaves no excess. For it is not said that he abstained from this evil, but not from that, or that he mastered many, but was mastered by few, but he wished to touch no wickedness. Yet it is not enough only to abstain from evils, but there must also be the working of good; for the idleness of virtue knows how to bring punishment, not only the working of wickedness. Since also those who did not feed the hungry, because they did not work almsgiving, for this are delivered to eternal punishment. Whence we learn that not abstaining from evils is the beginning of salvation for us, unless there is also the possession of good things, and the working of virtue. But see for me how in few words the law of the Holy Spirit gathered the praise of the man, calling Job true according to creation, as if registering this as his native land and ancestors; blameless according to action; upright according to good order and sharing of his possessions, and also according to rendering straight judgments for those judged, and the authority of all; God-fearing according to faith and hatred towards idols; turning away from every evil thing according to the hottest aversion to wicked things. And to sum up, he did nothing ever worthy of blame, but kept just things towards men, and pursued matters of religion purely, doing all things according to God, and genuinely revering the Divine.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.”</i><sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup></span> First he spoke of virtue, and then of the things given by God. For from virtue long ago these came: good children, I say, and many children. <i>“There shall not be in you barren, nor unfruitful in your land.”<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup></i> But Abraham was for this reason barren, that you might learn that these are not truly the rewards of virtue, but others; but for this he promised these, condescending. We gather, then, that marriage is no impediment to virtue; otherwise it would have been a hindrance also for Job. But indeed this bond did not hinder the righteous man from running rightly, so that also this some plead in vain.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she-asses, and very many servants; and his works were great upon the earth.”</i><sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup></span> See then wealth of a more rustic kind; for he did not list loans and interest, nor golden-roofed houses, but things appropriate for contests. Since the holy angels care for us and look after us; but the devil opposes our salvation, and concerning the same thing, that is, man, they are set against each other. They are said to stand together, God overseeing what is done; but we are victorious or vanquished, not because of the power of the opponents or the weakness of the allies, but because of our own choice. For each urging us on to themselves—the holy angels to good things, the destructive demons to evil—our choice, honored with free will, proceeds to whichever side it wishes. For neither does God force, having honored us with free will, nor does the devil possess any compelling power against us, but by choice we either succeed or sin, leaning to angels or demons.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And the Lord said to the devil: ‘Where have you come from?’”</i><sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup></span> And why then does the devil stand together with the angelic service, and does the unclean one speak freely in the midst of the holy spirits? Neither did the angels stand before God bodily, nor Satan; but all service is called standing. As a creature of God, then, the devil also is commanded to do what is fitting; for even if he rebelled in purpose, he is under the yoke of servitude, and is commanded as an executioner to do what is ordered. And just as our rulers, when they call someone with honor, send honorable men; when they drag someone with dishonor, they send some rough soldiers; so also God sends ministering angels to the holy for salvation; but when he wishes to punish, he entrusts to the evil-working powers. Whence also Paul delivers the one who sinned in Corinth to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, and others again, that they may not blaspheme.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And the devil answered the Lord and said: ‘Going round the earth and walking up and down under heaven, I am present.’”</i><sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup></span> By advancing the discourse through question and answer, Scripture rather delineated the truth, and cuts off every pretext of the shameless. For what it says the devil said to God, he did not say, but thought; for such boldness did not belong to him. And from his saying that he goes about everywhere, first he becomes his own accuser, as no longer having a firm station, but being carried about everywhere unstably, having undertaken battle against all men. Next we learn that the inhabited world is filled with both demons and angels, and that both are under the authority of God, and that angels come to God receiving command; but the devil will not be able to do anything of his own pleasure without receiving permission from above. For even if he rebelled, and is outside of serving God, yet fear lies upon him like a bridle, and he is not allowed to use his own authority. But see, those come as servants, reporting what is done; this one has nothing to say. Heaven, then, is inaccessible to this evil demon, and he is not present everywhere at the same time, but by circuit. “Under heaven,” he says, to hint also at the desert, and whatever is under heaven, and the airy place; and he wanders also the uninhabited, according to some dispensation of God, so that he may not trouble our race continually.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And the Lord said to him, ‘Have you considered my servant Job?’”</i><sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup></span> From this we learn that God wished Job to be tested, as one having a noble athlete; for for this reason he asks the devil, that he may give him an occasion for the contest. He did not wish to provide the occasion himself, lest he seem to be some ambitious one. But see, how the manner of discourse is gradually exposed: no longer does he show him making a report of words, but “Have you considered?” Or how the story delivered a voice. God, then, allowed the devil to know even without voice, that his wicked plan and action did not escape him; and as it were speaks to him: “Where have you come from?” not wishing to learn the evil one’s occupation (for how could he, who has knowledge of all things present?), but he is accustomed often to characterize the sayings in the form of a question, just as also in the Gospels the Lord brings inquiries to Cleopas: “What words are these that you exchange with one another?” And who would dare to say that the one who formed our hearts alone needs questioning? Such also is: “How many loaves do you have?” and elsewhere, confirming his resurrection, he said: “Do you have any food here?” and concerning Lazarus he inquired: “Where have you laid him?”—he who anticipated the report and foretold his death. In the same manner here, saying to the devil: “Where have you come from?” and “Have you considered my servant?” he does not put forth words of ignorance, nor does he wish to be taught the life of the enemy, but shows that very one as the accuser of his own cruelty. For wickedness is accustomed to betray itself.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“A man blameless, true, God-fearing, turning away from every evil thing.”</i><sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup></span> What harm is there from men despising and the whole world, when the Master of angels praises and proclaims? Just as, if he does not bless, even if all inhabiting earth and sea praise, there is no benefit. This, then, let us observe everywhere, how he may proclaim us; even if this be, we are higher than all, even if in poverty, and in sickness, even if we are in sensible evils. Since also the blessed Job, sitting on the dunghill, and surrounded with the discharge of his wounds, and streaming with countless springs of worms, and suffering those unendurable things, spat upon by servants, by friends, by enemies, plotted against by his wife, brought down into poverty, into famine, into that unendurable sickness, was more blessed than all. How? Because God blessed him, saying: “A righteous man, blameless, true, God-fearing.” For how, surpassing all on earth, did he happen, with the God of all testifying for him, in saying: blameless, a true man, having virtue incomparable, both keeping just things towards men blamelessly, and pursuing piety towards God accurately? And that the devil, observing his affairs, had acquired no small wonder concerning him. But why ever does he change the order of the praises here? Perhaps he does this indifferently, or perhaps also according to the nature of things and the harmony, he arranges the praise. For first, every man is true according to the principle of creation; then thus blameless, according to the manner of life; here, because of the battle with the devil, he puts blameless before true. For virtue knows how to fight wickedness, and the righteousness of character becomes the sharpest arrow to the slanderer. Then thus he joins true to blameless, that he may show also nature agreeing with character, and choice adorning the nobility of nature.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And you have made his cattle many upon the earth.”</i><sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup></span> You see the wealth given by God, you see that it is not from injustice; for you, he says, fenced around, blessed, made his many. How much did Job need to toil to persuade men that his wealth was not from injustice? Behold, the devil testified this to him, even though he does not know.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“But will he indeed bless you to your face?”</i><sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup></span> For this is "to your face": openly, shamelessly, not concealing.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“Then the Lord said to the devil: ‘Behold, all that he has I give into your hand, but do not touch him himself.’”</i><sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup></span> For thus, he says, I am confident in my athlete, that you said: “Send forth your hand”; but I say: “Into your hand I give all that he has.” Into your hand, the filthy, the insatiable; what do you say? What need after your testimony of another torture? “That the devil may be silenced,” he says, “that the righteous may appear more brilliant, that we may leave for those after us medicines both of endurance and of affliction.”</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And it was as this day.”</i><sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup></span> That the writer may show the swiftness of the purpose he says this; for not yet was the day midway when he began the war.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And behold, an angel came to Job and said to him.”</i><sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup></span> Slaughter is mixed with destruction, which makes the enemies appear burdensome; great is the cruelty and inhumanity, double the calamity: slaughter and captivity; and the salvation of the one left is an addition of evils. You saw how swift the blow, new and strange the calamity; he who was in such abundance, and had never experienced any such thing, suddenly came into deprivation of all his possessions; for not some were taken, others left behind, for some comfort of the perishing, but he himself is left alone, the one announcing the tragedy.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“While this one was still speaking, another angel came and said to Job: ‘Fire fell from heaven and burned up the sheep, and likewise consumed the shepherds; and I alone escaped to tell you.’”</i><sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup></span> The evil one regretted that he announced the first things badly. Badly, he says, I shot, I did not hit the mark, the arrow strayed. I said that men took captive the oxen and the donkeys; Job can reason: “Men have wronged me; what is this to God? Shall I ascribe the injustice of men to God? Others the wrongdoers, and another will be the blasphemed?” Therefore, that he may turn his mind from men to God, he says: “Fire fell from heaven.” But Aquila and Theodotion said: “fire of God.” You cannot say: “Enemies threw from above; insult the wrongdoer, blaspheme the one making war; why do you worship him? Why do you bow down to the one who consumes your possessions?” Do not think the blows are human, hearing of captors; from above he wages war against you, from heaven, God. And it is clear, so that also fire coming down from heaven consumed the sheep. See how great the power of the devil, how he stirred up so many nations, whether shaping demons into enemies—imagine for me the ease—not thinking it to be fire in reality (for he cannot create), but thus he showed burning all; or if it was fire in reality, he stirred this also from existing matter, God permitting.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“While this one was still speaking, another angel comes, saying to Job: ‘Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking at their eldest brother's house, and suddenly a great wind came from the desert and struck the four corners of the house, and the house fell upon your children, and they died; and I alone escaped to tell you.’”</i><sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup></span> And this he shook upon them, so that not even for burial was each body clearly distinguishable thereafter. And he added “eating and drinking,” that he might say: at the very time of cheerfulness. For as bringing every trial, and stripping him of possessions, he did not strip him of virtue, he proceeds then against nature, tears the branches from the root, removes the fruit, that he may grieve the parent. And see the announcement, how full it is of irony, and tending to sorcery, and able to break the soul of the noble man. “A great wind came from the desert.” And again, he slanders the Judge; for wind does not obey men, but God. And he did not say: “The house fell upon those inside,” but what was able to raise grief: “upon your children,” that hearing of the children, he may come to pity, and bend to sympathy, and lamenting say: “Alas! Suddenly the man of many children has become childless; better not to have received, than to have received thus, that I may learn of whom I have been deprived.” For the past peace and calm and prosperity make the calamity more grievous. Moreover, “I alone escaped,” for the others somehow had a reason, but here it makes the suffering greater, if after the children departed, I alone escaped, the one bringing the message. Whence it seems to me that the devil himself is the one announcing these things, himself the author of the evils, coming in various ways, and making the announcements with cunning. Therefore he visits continually, and speaks evilly, and places the more grievous dangers last; that corrupting the strength of the soul with the lesser, he may prepare the approach of the greater unopposed. That it was not one of the servants bringing the announcements, is clear from this: for how did the house, struck at the four corners, save the one? And how also for each blow, one, and alone, was found the one superior to the dangers, as if preserved for this? But it was he himself, both acting and announcing the difficulties. For no other is found more bitter, wherefore he did not entrust the service of such evil deeds to another. The cunning one varies the blows, intending nothing moderate, that thus he may shake the strongholds of the soul by partial assaults; and just as someone bringing engines against walls, deceives the one being besieged, stealing security by manifold plots, so the slanderer, in a certain order within disorder and impiety, brought the dangers against the tower of piety.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“Thus hearing, Job arose and tore his garments and shaved the hair of his head.”</i><sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup></span> If, then, he tore his garments and shaved his hair, do not marvel; for he was a father, and a loving father; and it was necessary both that the sympathy of nature be moved, and the philosophy of his resolve. For if he did not do this, perhaps someone would have thought this philosophy to be insensibility. Therefore, he both shows his inward parts, and the precision of philosophy, and grieving, he was not overturned. Do not think the matter to be defeat; this especially shows the victory; for if he did not do this, someone would have said that God made him insensible to sufferings. But now he shows that even grieving he philosophizes; truly he built his soul upon his rock. The rain descended—for “fire,” he says, “fell from heaven and consumed all the flocks”; the rivers came, the frequent and continuous, and the successive messengers of calamities, the one concerning the goats, the other the camels, the other speaking the destruction of the children; the winds blew, the bitter words of the wife: for “Say,” she says, “some word to the Lord, and die.” And the house did not fall, the soul was not tripped up, the righteous did not blaspheme, but even gave thanks, even though the devil was the one making war, the evil, the savage, never reconciled to human nature, but taking up implacable war and unannounced battle against our race; and not simply was he angry, but he stirred all devices, and brought every trick. And not even thus did he refute the bravery of the righteous, but the noble man laughed at his arrows, and bore that unbearable war nobly; and these things not in grace, but before the Old Covenant, and before grace; and he showed that not the nature of temptations, but the carelessness of the negligent, is accustomed to cause the fall; as the strong one, affliction makes stronger; <i>“for tribulation,” it says, “works patience.”<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup></i> And just as the strong trees, the force of winds falling upon them and blowing from all sides, does not uproot, but makes them stronger by these assaults; so also a steadfast soul, living with piety, the onslaughts of tribulations do not trip up, but anoint for greater endurance, and cannot harm the virtue of man. And what is the virtue of man? Not wealth, that you may fear poverty; nor health of body, that you may fear sickness; nor the opinion of the many, that you may shrink from evil reputation; nor simply living anyhow, that death may not be fearful to you; nor freedom, that you may flee slavery; but the accuracy of true doctrines, and correctness according to life. These not even the devil himself will be able to plunder, if the one possessing them guards them with due precision; and this the most evil and savage demon knows. For indeed because of this, he plundered the substance of Job, not to make him poor, but to force him to utter some blasphemous word; and he cut his body, not to clothe him with sickness, but to trip up the virtue according to soul. But nevertheless, defeating all his devices, and making him poor instead of rich, this indeed seeming most terrible to all, instead of many-children childless, and having scraped his whole body, worse than the public executioners (for not so do their claws dig the sides of the condemned, as the mouths of worms scraped his flesh), and having placed upon him an evil reputation (for the friends present with him said: “You are not scourged worthily of your sins,” and they extended many accusations against him); and not only did he cast him out of the city, nor from the house, and place him into another city, but making the dunghill his house and city, not only did he harm him in nothing, but also made him more brilliant through what he plotted. Not only did he not take away any of his existing things, even though taking away so many, but also produced for him a greater wealth of virtue; for after these things he enjoyed greater freedom, as having contended a more vehement contest. If he, suffering such things, was not wronged at all, and suffering not from man, but from the demon more evil than all men—who then will have excuse who say: “Such a one wronged and harmed me”? For if the devil, full of so much evil, moving all his instruments, and letting loose all his arrows, and emptying into the house of the righteous, and into his body, whatever evils are among men, with much excess, wronged the man not at all, but, as I said, rather benefited him—how will some be able to accuse such and such a one, as wronged by them, and not as wronged from within? “How from within?” he says, when someone is scourged by someone, or his possessions taken away, or suffering some other grievous insult, utters some blasphemous word? He was harmed from there, and a greatest harm, not indeed from the one insulting, but from his own smallness of soul; for which I said before, and now I say: No one of men, even if he be ten thousand times evil, would attack more evilly or more bitterly than that avenging demon, and the devil having irreconcilable hostility towards us; but nevertheless this grievous demon could not, against the one before the Law, before grace, having shot such arrows and so bitter from all sides, trip up and cast down. For now among us, many of those mourning nourish long hair, but he removed it. Why? For the mourner, what was aimed at was to turn the condition to the opposite appearance. Where, then, long hair is honored, to be shaved is a sign of mourning. And he tore his garments: by the appearance, lamenting towards suffering; but in truth, stripping again, and henceforth dedicating himself to the contest, that as a naked athlete he may grapple with the adversary.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And falling to the ground he worshipped the Lord, and said: ‘Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there.’”</i><sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup></span> This Job cut short the appearance of the devil, being struck, not striking; he emptied all his quiver, being shot at continually by him; he endured every kind of temptation, and each with all excess. For the things seeming in life to be terrible—riches, glory, power, children, bodily health—all these having taken away, he showed that none of them is true good. Consider how great the waves: to be stripped of possessions, to lose children, to be in sickness, to have a wife worse than any enemy, friends slandering, servants insulting; if each of these alone is unbearable, consider the height of the waves when they appear together. But nevertheless he said nothing such as some of the weaker might say: “For these I nourished the children, and with all exactness trained? For these I opened my house to passersby, that after those many runs, for the needy, for the naked, for the orphans, I might receive these repayments?” But instead of these, upon the calamity of the children, he offered things better than every sacrifice, which bound that holy head rather with countless crowns, and proclaimed more brilliantly than many trumpets; for he said: <i>“Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return.”<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup></i> “For these were not mine, I was about to depart from them a little later; <i>‘For we brought nothing into the world, it is clear that neither can we carry anything out.’”<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup></i> And before the words, falling to the ground he worships; even though suffering such things, he did not depart from piety towards God, but falling upon the earth, he cast down the one who said: “Indeed, he will bless you to your face.” He showed nature, he showed also reverence; for having indicated wisely sympathy for the children, he anticipates passion with courage, and no longer goes out to laments, but utters those divine words: “For naked,” he says, “I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there.” Of what womb does he make mention? Perhaps then he speaks of the first creation, calling “womb” that which fashioned man from earth naked, and free from all evil, appropriating the creation of the first father; so that the sense is such: “Naked I was formed from the earth, by divine grace, someone superfluous, and as if immaterial; naked therefore shall I also depart there.” Where? Clearly, to the place free from mourning. For if you take the thought according to the obvious meaning, and suppose that “Coming out from the maternal womb, into this again I shall depart,” neither the seemliness of the word is preserved, nor the harmony of the expression. For which of the sane would wrong nature in his own thought, giving back to a mother’s womb the one from her, and corrupting through both each one, working a double killing by one fable? Since also Nicodemus, hearing concerning the bath of regeneration, <i>“Unless one is born again,”<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup></i> answered thickly and lowly; for he thought he heard of birth from flesh, dragged down in his thoughts, and imagining nothing lofty.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away; as it seemed good to the Lord, so has it happened; blessed be the name of the Lord.”</i><sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup></span> For Job was indeed maddened, but only so much as is fitting for a child-loving father, and one greatly caring for the departed. He did not say, as the many: “Better not to have had experience, nor to have been called father, than after tasting the pleasure to fall away”; but beyond what he received, he gave thanks; beyond what he did not have to the end, he glorified. He did not say: “Better not to have received this,” which some say ungratefully, but also for those he gave thanks, saying: “The Lord gave”; and for these he blessed, saying: “The Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.” And thus he silenced his wife, justifying himself to her, and uttering those marvelous words: <i>“If we have received good things from the hand of the Lord, shall we not endure evil things?”<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup></i> And each of other men, conscious to himself of many evil things, knows the cause why he suffers, and this is no small consolation; but he did not even have this to consider, that he was paying penalties for sins, which especially troubled his reasoning. When he looked upon his own life, and conscience shining above the sun, and the multitude of good deeds, he knew that he was worthy of crowns, and prizes, and countless rewards; but when he looked upon all that had happened, suffering more grievous things than those who had dared the worst, he could not find a cause to say why he suffered these things. Therefore, having no cause to assign to the calamity, he flees to the incomprehensible economy of God, and ascribing what happened to the will, he said: “As it seemed good to the Lord, so it has happened. For I do not think one ought to examine the Master’s purpose. Blessed be the name of the Lord.” “Nothing unmusical,” he says, “do I utter concerning God, but I judge worthy of hymns both for what he formerly provided at the beginning, and for what he now approved to take away.” With such words the righteous man shot down the devil; and marvelous, that even thinking he was deprived by God, he gives thanks, and is not broken. Do this also, and reason with yourself, that not man took, but God who made, who cares more for you, and knows what is expedient, not an enemy, nor a plotter. Help the departed, performing remembrance for them. For if the sacrifice of the spirit seated the children of Job, why do you doubt if also for us, offering for the departed, there becomes some consolation for them? For God is accustomed to grant to some for others. Let us be benefited according to the sensible, that every creature follows the Creator; wherefore according to expedience he both gives to each and takes away, exercising at once our gratitude and endurance. For gratitude for things provided was the basis of a second benefaction.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“In all these things that happened to him, Job sinned nothing with his lips before the Lord, and gave no folly to God.”</i><sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup></span> Just as on images, when we paint someone, below on the bases we inscribe: “Such a one dedicated”; so also here, the writer of the book, painting the image of the soul of the righteous through words, as if inscribing below on a base, says that “In all these Job sinned nothing with his lips before the Lord.” Do not think that he conducted himself well before men, but not before God; but he sinned not even in thought. And what is “not with his lips”? Often, seized by passion, we utter a word, the mind not consenting, but the tongue being seized by despondency. But he did not suffer even this, but pure was the mind from blasphemy, and pure the tongue from wicked words. <i>“And gave no folly to God,”<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup></i> that is, did not condemn the things that happened as injustice; he did not say, as many: “Simply and as chance the things are borne,” but: “As it seemed good to the Lord, so it has happened.” Let us not, then, ever breathe freely while we are here, but always box, especially in the time of sickness, when pains from all sides trouble the soul, when sufferings besiege, when the devil stands by, urging to say some bitter word. Then especially we must secure ourselves, and fence with the breastplate of endurance, and the weapon of thanksgiving. For these are the grievous arrows against the devil, this the deadly wound; then especially bright are the crowns. Since also the blessed Job this especially made brilliant, this proclaimed, that in time of temptation, and sickness, and poverty, to appear unturned and unshaken in mind, to offer words of thanksgiving to God, and that spiritual sacrifice. For a sacrifice were the words he said: <i>“The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away,”<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup></i> and the following; which also let us always do, in temptations, in circumstances, in plots, glorifying God.</p>
