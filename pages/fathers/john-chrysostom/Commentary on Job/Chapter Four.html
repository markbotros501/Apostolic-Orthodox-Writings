    <h1>Chapter Four</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Has it not been spoken to you often in weariness? And who will endure the strength of your words?"</i><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></span> Scripture knows to call sin 'weariness'; as when it says, "Under his tongue is weariness and pain."<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> So Eliphaz says, "See, O Job, lest perhaps you have spoken something in sin, and therefore you now suffer thus." He did not say, "Has it not been done to you?" but "Has it not been spoken to you?" For since his life was shining, and he had many memorials of virtue everywhere on the earth. "Lest you say this," he says, "even if your deeds are good and beautiful; for it happens that the sin has occurred in the words."</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"For if you have admonished many, and have encouraged weak hands, and raised up the sick with words, and put courage around weak knees; but now pain has come upon you, and touched you, you have been troubled."</i><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></span> He did not mention the things accomplished by him in wealth, for it was possible to oppose the poverty; but if he benefited any by words. What he says is such: "The present circumstances," he says, "fight against the old assumption; for he who often restored others with words, and raised up those who had all but fallen, putting good hopes before them, what have you suffered? How are you unable to bear the pain that has come upon you? But you have been troubled," that is, you have been disturbed. The expression is said from the fact that those who are disturbed hasten. Yet it was fitting for you, remembering your own words, and respecting these, to philosophize not only in the misfortunes of others, but also in your own misfortunes. Observe, then, that, among the other virtues, Eliphaz testifies to Job, that he also had a teaching gift, and offered the consoling word with divine grace, so as to prepare even those in misfortunes to be cheerful through the exhortation. These words of Eliphaz are not yet harsh; but those that follow no longer speak according to the quality of the comforter's character. Hear, then:</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"Is not your fear in folly? And your hope, and the wickedness of your way?"</i><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></span> But Aquila: "Your endurance, and the simplicity of your ways." He weaves a vain syllogism; for since he said, "Fear which I considered has come to me," he says, "That this fear was in folly, and your hope was from the wickedness of your heart; for it is senseless, being good, to expect such things; so you have convicted yourself, that you were of a wicked life; for if you were confident in purity, the fear is vain."</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"By the command of the Lord they will perish; and by the breath of his wrath they will be destroyed."</i><sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></span> The "by the command of the Lord," "Do not think," he says, "that the things that have happened are of evil demons, nor of plotting men. God is the one punishing; is not the punishment therefore unquestionably just?"</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And if any true word has occurred in your words."</i><sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></span> The "if any true word has occurred in your words," hints that Job often said some solemn things, either leading some to zeal, or for some other economy.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"If against his servants he does not trust, but against his angels he devised something perverse."</i><sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></span> Well did he say "devised"; for through this he shows his wisdom, so that the greatness of their nature might not exalt them, but they might be subjected to God always. For if even against them he devised something perverse, that is, he punished them for abandoning their own dwelling.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"He struck them in the manner of a moth, and from morning until evening they are no more."</i><sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></span> The "He struck them in the manner of a moth," instead of, easily and destroyed the innermost parts. The "breathed upon," that is, he did not need labor, but only willed, and their end came. This is said from the metaphor of the angry, who have the habit, instead of reproof, to use the breath. The "From morning until evening they are no more," he said, either because Job endured all things on the same day; or so as to show, that God does not need time, punishing the impious.</p>
