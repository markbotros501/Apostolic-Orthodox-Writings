    <h1>Chapter Two</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them.”</i><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></span> Why does the writer introduce them presenting themselves each day? That we may learn that the present things are not without providence, but they give an account of the things happening each day, and each day angels are sent out arranging something, even if we do not know it.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And the Lord said to Satan, ‘Where have you come from?’”</i><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></span> He knew where he came from, that he was defeated by the righteous man; but he wishes to see if he acknowledges the defeat gratefully.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And the Lord said to Satan, ‘Have you considered my servant Job? There is none like him on the earth, a man blameless, true, irreproachable, God-fearing, turning away from every evil thing, and still he holds fast his integrity. But you said, “Without cause to destroy his possessions.”’”</i><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></span> The devil, hiding his defeat, uses the first voice: “Going about the earth,” he says, “I am present.” But God reveals what that one hid out of envy; and since he did not learn the defeat he suffered by asking, he himself brands it, and reveals the victory of the righteous: “You have gone about the whole earth.” What then? Did you go out for this? Did you ask for this? Did you not say, “Give me Job’s possessions”? Why do you hide the contest? So that you may obliterate the crown of victory. “Have you considered my servant Job? There is none like him, a blameless man.” Do not pass over what is said simply, but note that in the first testimony nowhere was the word “blameless” used; but not having remembered this name before, now he added to him the crown of blamelessness, since he bore evils gratefully. If therefore he seems to utter something bold in what follows, it is reckoned to his blamelessness. And Job himself says later, “The Lord knows my blamelessness.” To the blameless, no word is counted as wickedness; for we judge not by deeds, but by the intention of the doers. A son insults a father, and the deed is impious, and he is condemned as a parricide, because he roared a hostile voice against his father, and dared to defame his own root; but a blameless child, even if he strikes his father or mother, the insult is more desirable than all joy. Often mothers provoke their children to insult, not for the insult, but for the blamelessness, for the guileless and simple character, rejoicing; so also God, knowing that he does not speak from wickedness, receives from Job what is said, being called to judgment by him; for the word is of blamelessness, not wickedness. “In vain,” he says, “did you envy his abundance, saying that the man is pious because of his wealth. He was stripped of his possessions, and was not stripped of his piety. You did not wish, O shameless one, to believe me as God. From the trial, then, should he not be trusted henceforth that my servant measures his philosophy not by prosperity?” See, he did not say, “Without cause his possessions were lost,” but, “You said to destroy without cause”; since he himself received no ordinary reward for the loss.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"'But stretch out your hand and touch his bones and his flesh; surely he will curse you to your face.'"</i><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></span> The beast is savage and shameless; for he is not content only to gorge on our flesh, but wishes to go even to bones and marrow; he does not lack wickedness, he again finds a device. “It is nothing great,” he says, “if he lost possessions, having gladly despised all things to save himself. But if you do not permit taking his soul?” For he hinted at this by saying, “A man will give all that he has for his life.” Strike, then, the body. Why did he not ask this from the beginning? He reckoned that if he happened to be defeated, it is better to bring the victory from lesser things; but if not, I will prevail through the body. “Wealth is not of great account to men,” he says; “for they give all things for the salvation of their own life.” And not simply, “touch his flesh,” he said, but so that evil may be born within, thus with wickedness he speaks.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">From this it is shown that the ancient dragon has no authority against us unless permitted by God, according to his ineffable dispensations concerning us. And as he is able to kill a man, if he receives permission, but he cannot do evil unless he asks from God. For he knows, even though he fell, that unless God allows, he can do nothing against anyone; the permission being understood thus, that it happens wisely, since it comes from God. What he says is this: remove from him the guard of external care and of care for the soul; for it is not worthy of wonder if you guard him unscathed; allow me to destroy his flesh even to the marrow. For he knows how calamity convicts an untrained mind, luxury and mere pampering of care for you, having as its basis that if you touch his flesh, then he will curse you to your face, that is, he will blaspheme you openly.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"And the Lord said to Satan, 'Behold, I give him into your hand; only spare his soul.'"</i><sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></span> (Theodotion: "Do not touch his soul.") Again the philanthropic God, wishing to publish his own crown-wearers to angels and men, permits this also, so that we may learn that whatever the Evil One can do, he can do by permission. And he said, “You touch his flesh.” But lest he say, “You struck him openly, as your own servant,” he did not do what the devil asked, but entrusted it to him. See, he did not say only, “Do not touch his soul,” but, “Only preserve his soul,” placing him in great fear: “The salvation of his soul,” he says, “I seek from you.” For since it was likely that he would inflict such things as to kill the body, and he could say, “I did not touch his soul,” therefore, he says, preserve it, lest something happen regarding the principle of life; for if you take it, the spectacle is no longer set for us.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And he struck Job with severe sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.”</i><sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></span> He struck him, it says, with a most severe torment, with injury and elephantiasis over the whole body; for he made his whole body one wound, one bruise, so that through all his members he might be shown as a crown-bearer. For wickedness does not know how to spare, being a corruption according to its own most bitter disposition.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And he took a potsherd to scrape away the discharge, and he sat upon the ash heap outside the city.”</i><sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></span> For what reason did he not scrape away the discharge with his hands or fingers? So that the treatment might not become a greater cause of disgust. And he, not enduring to heal himself, how would he have received healing from others? He was his own executioner, not digging into his sides, but cutting away the festering sore, and scraping the living clay with dead clay. For what reason did he sit upon the ash heap? So that he might cover the falling matter with the heap. For what reason in the open air? So that he might not choke himself with the stench; which would have happened if he had been shut in some little house; besides, the tempter left him no house. For the loss of the children was heavy, but nevertheless, this harsh tragedy awaited another harsher one, and he did not breathe even a little. From here the springs of worms, the streams of discharge, the seat upon the ash heap, the potsherd scraping his sides, the stench of sores, introducing that new hunger, and not allowing him to touch food though seeing it, and imposing disgust worse than hunger, and these not for two, ten, twenty, or a hundred days, but for more months.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">But the examples concerning Job, and the wounds of the righteous man, and the ash heap, more honorable than any royal throne, will comfort the suffering not moderately. For to see a royal throne will bring no profit to the viewers, but only temporary pleasure, having no benefit; but to see the ash heap of Job, everyone will receive all benefit, and much philosophy, and consolation for the sake of endurance.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore many now undertake a long and overseas journey, running from the ends of the earth to Arabia, that they may see that ash heap, and having seen, kiss the ground that received the footprints of that crown-bearer, and the blood more precious than all gold. For not so bright is purple, as that body then shone, bathed not with foreign, but with its own blood; and those wounds were more precious than all stones. For the nature of pearls does not benefit our life, nor does it fulfill any necessary need for those who have them; but those wounds are consolation for all despondency. And that you may learn that this is true, if someone loses a genuine and only-begotten son, show him ten thousand pearls, and you will not comfort the suffering, nor heal the pain. But reminding him of the wounds of Job, you will easily be able to heal, saying thus: “Why do you mourn, O man? You lost one child, but that blessed man, after the whole chorus of children was taken away, also received a blow on his very flesh, and sat naked upon the ash heap, streaming with discharge from all sides, his flesh being consumed little by little—the righteous, the God-fearing, having God as witness of his virtue.” For if you say these words, you will quench all despondency of the mourner, and remove all pain; and thus the wounds of the righteous become more useful than pearls. Trace, then, for yourselves the athlete, and think you see that ash heap, and him sitting in the midst, the golden statue, the jeweled one—how shall I say, I know not. For I have no material so precious as to be able to compare that bloodied body. Thus also, from all most precious material, from the much abundance of that flesh, its nature was more precious, and the wounds brighter than the sun’s rays; for these illumine the appearances of the body, but those enlighten the eyes of our mind, those utterly blinded the devil; therefore, after that blow, he leapt away, and appeared no more.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">And you, beloved, learn from this also how great the gain of tribulation is; for when the righteous was wealthy and enjoyed ease, he had to slander him—falsely, but still he had something to say: “Does Job fear God for nothing?” But when he stripped him and made him poor, he no longer dared even to mutter. And while he was rich, he promised to wrestle with him and threatened to trip him; but when he made him poor, and deprived him of all, and cast him into extreme pain, then he leapt away; and while his body was healthy, he raised his hands against him, but when he cut his flesh, then he fled defeated. Did you see how much poverty is better than wealth, sickness than health, and temptation than ease for the sober, and more useful, and makes those who struggle brighter and more vigorous? Who has seen, who has heard such marvelous contests? The boxers of external contests, when they cut the heads of their opponents, then they win and are crowned; but this one, when he cut the body of the righteous with various sores, piercing it, and made it weaker, then he was defeated and withdrew. And since he dug through his sides from all sides, nothing more came to him; for he did not plunder the treasure laid up within, but made it more manifest to us, and through that digging, he gave to all to look within and learn all his wealth; and when he expected to prevail, then he withdrew with much shame, and uttered no further voice. What happened, O devil? Why do you withdraw? Did not all that you wished happen? Did you not destroy his flocks, herds, droves of horses, mules? Did you not also destroy the chorus of children, and cut all his flesh? Why do you withdraw? “Because all that I wished happened,” he says; “but what I especially wished to happen, and for which I did all, this did not happen; for he did not blaspheme.” “For I did all those things,” he says, “so that this might come out; but since this did not happen, I gained nothing more from the loss of possessions, and the destruction of children, and the blow to the body; but the opposite of what I wished came out: I made the enemy more brilliant and more radiant.” Did you know how great the gain of tribulation is? For the body was good and healthy; but it became much more honorable, cut by those wounds. Since also wool is beautiful even before dyeing, but when it becomes purple, it receives indescribable beauty, and much comeliness. If he had not stripped him, we would not have known the crown-bearer’s good condition; if he had not pierced his body with scars, the rays would not have shone from within; if he had not seated him upon the ash heap, we would not have known his wealth; for not so bright is a king sitting upon a throne, as he, then sitting upon the ash heap, was conspicuous and manifest; for after the royal throne comes death, but after that ash heap, the kingdom of heaven.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">I set forth this story, not that you may praise what is said, but that you may imitate the virtue and endurance of the man; that through their works you may learn that nothing of human things is terrible, but sin alone. Not poverty, not sickness, not insult, not arrogance, not dishonor, not what seems to all the ultimate of evils—death; for these are only names to those who philosophize, names of misfortunes, empty of reality; but the true misfortune is to offend God and to do something not pleasing to him.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">It remains to make a comparison of successes and sufferings, that you may learn clearly that not only for successes, but also for sufferings, rewards are laid up, and very great rewards, and for sufferings not less than for successes, rather there is where it is more than for successes. And let us bring in, if it seems good, the great athlete of endurance, who shone in both these, that you may see from where he shone more greatly. Let us see, then, comparing: when was he more brilliant, when he was a common harbor for those in need, or when he suffered painful things, causing him much despondency? When he opened his house to all passersby, or when it collapsed and he uttered no bitter word, but spoke well of God?—though the one was a success, the other a suffering. Tell me, when was he more radiant? When he sacrificed for his children and gathered them for harmony, or when they were buried and ended their life in the bitterest manner, and he bore what happened with much philosophy? When did he shine more? When the shoulders of the naked were warmed from the shearing of his sheep, or when hearing, “Fire fell from heaven and consumed the herd with the shepherds,” he was not troubled, nor disturbed, but bore the misfortune gently? When was he greater? When with the health of his body he used it for the protection of the wronged, crushing the mills of the unjust, and snatching plunder from the teeth, and becoming a harbor for them, or when he saw this body of his, the weapon of the wronged, being eaten by worms, and sitting upon the ash heap, he himself scraped it, taking a potsherd? “For I dissolve clods of earth, scraping from discharge,” he says. And yet all those were successes, all these were sufferings; but nevertheless these showed him more brilliant than those. For this most bitter part of the battle was for him, requiring greater courage, and a more vigorous soul, and a higher mind, and having more love for God.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, when those things happened, even if shamelessly and very boldly, nevertheless the devil opposed, saying: “Does Job fear God for nothing?” But when these things happened, covering himself he withdrew, turning his back, and having not even a shadow of shameless opposition to put forward.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>“And after much time had passed, his wife said to him: ‘How long will you endure, saying, “Behold, I wait a little longer, expecting the hope of my salvation”?’”</i><sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></span> And he, as the contest advanced further for him, again wins other crowns from the words to his wife. For the wife was left especially, after all had vanished for him—children, possessions, his very body—and she for trial and plot. Therefore the devil did not destroy her with the children, nor ask for her slaughter, since he expected her to contribute greatly to the plot against this holy man; therefore, as a very great weapon, he left her to him. “For if through her,” he says, “I cast Adam out of paradise, much more will I be able to trip Job from the ash heap.” And see the wickedness: not when the oxen perished did he bring this device, nor the donkeys, nor the camels, nor when the house collapsed, nor when the children were buried, but he is silent and quiet for a while, looking at the athlete; but when the spring of worms gushed forth, and the skin rotting fell away, and the flesh being consumed, full of much stinking discharge, and more painful than frying pans, furnaces, and all flame, the hand of the devil was consuming him, more savage than any beast, gnawing from all sides, and eating the body; and in this misfortune much time passed, then he brings her, already pickled and prepared. For if she had come at the beginning of the misfortune, she would not have found him so enervated, nor would she have been able to amplify the misfortune so and exalt it in speech. But now when he saw him, through the length of time thirsting for release, and desiring intensely the cessation of what was pressing, then she approaches. For when he was severely afflicted, and no longer even had breath, but even desired to die, hear what he says: “For if only I could lay hands on myself, or asking another, and he would do this for me.” And see for me the wickedness of the woman, how she begins immediately from the length of time: “How long will you endure?” she says. And if often, even without real things, words alone have been able to soften, consider what he was likely to suffer then, with these words and the things afflicting him; and what is worse of all, that a woman was saying these things, and a woman fallen and despairing, and therefore eager to cast him into despair.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">But that we may see the device more clearly, applied to this adamantine wall, let us hear the very words. What then are these? “How long will you endure, saying, ‘Behold, I wait a little longer, expecting the hope of my salvation’?” “For your words,” she says, “are convicted by time, becoming longer, showing no release.” And she said these things, not only casting him into despair, but also reproaching and mocking; for he, always comforting and putting off the annoyance, uttered such things: “Wait a little longer, and quickly there will be an end of these.” Reproaching him, therefore, she says, “Will you not now say the same? For much time has already passed, and no end of these has appeared.” Why, O woman, do you weaken the athlete? Why do you restrain his hands? Ought to say, “Yet a little.” And see the wickedness: for she does not mention the oxen, nor the sheep, nor the camels; for she knew he was not greatly pained by these, but she comes immediately to nature, and reminds him of the children; for she saw him on account of them, and rending his garment, and cutting his hair. And she did not say, "Your children perished," but very pathetically: <i>"For behold, your memorial is cut off from the earth; sons and daughters, the pains and labors of my womb, whom I labored in vain with toils."</i></p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">At first, children were desirable because each left a memorial and remains of his own life. For since there were not yet hopes of resurrection, but death prevailed, and after this life those who died were thought to perish, God gave the comfort from children, so that living images of the departed might remain, and our race be preserved, and for those about to die, and for the relatives of those, the greatest comfort be their offspring. And that you may learn that especially for this reason children were desirable, hear what Job’s wife laments to Job, after many and unspeakable blows. “Behold,” she says, “your memorial is cut off from the earth.” And again Saul to David: “Swear to me that you will not destroy my seed and my name after me.” For if even now, with resurrection revealed, children are desirable from this, that they preserve the memory of the departed, much more then; therefore the curse from this becomes more bitter; for not even there did the one cursing say, “May the children be exterminated,” but, “His memorial from the earth.” Sons and daughters. Having said “memorial,” again with precision she remembers each nature. “Not a son,” she says, “not a daughter remains, who might preserve the memory by succession”; almost saying that even if health should happen, the enjoyment of health is useless, children not being; for on children the ancients placed the hope of continuance, and the future promise, they clung to mortal resurrection. She does not mention wealth, nor livestock; for she knew he was magnanimous, but what especially could grip him: “What change,” she says, “do you expect to be? Is it possible for the destroyed to return? Barren, childless, uprooted you are torn up, none left through whom you will be remembered.” “But if,” she says, “you do not care for these, consider even mine.” And see the pathos: “The pains and labors of my womb, whom I labored in vain with toils.” Pains of childbirth, labors of upbringing. And what she says is this: “I, who bore the more, am wronged because of you, and I endured the labors, but am deprived of the fruits.” And she says these things to show that she also shares in the misfortune; for an adviser seems untrustworthy who philosophizes in others’ evils. Therefore, through all the words sending a dart of indifference, she mixes in also her own person, that by the memory of the children and by her own suffering she may more greatly provoke the righteous to despair. “Why,” she says, “always pushing away the present, do you encourage yourself vainly from the future, childless, homeless, naked, corrupted?”</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><i>"But you yourself sit in the rot of worms, spending the night in the open air."</i><sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup></span> Great emphasis: "himself"—that righteous, marvelous one, the chief of our goods. And see how she neither places the loss of wealth, nor passes over it in silence, but as was possible, and pathetically, she announces it, thus hinting; for when she says, <i>"And I, wandering and a servant, from place to place and from house to house,"</i> she hints at the loss, and shows great attachment; for these words are sufficient to raise the misfortune: "For I come to others' doors," she says. "Not only do I beg, but I wander, and serve a foreign and new servitude, going about everywhere, and carrying the tokens of misfortune, and teaching all my evils, changing place at different times, and knocking at doors for daily food, I who had acquired such abundance of goods." That she may say: "Not only have we lost the children, the basis of our memory, but you yourself are not held by so many terrors, but we have suffered the utmost poverty, choosing food for ourselves like hired workers, we who provided abundance freely to those in need; I, at least, have not even obtained servitude, nor is it possible to conceal the shame of poverty in one house, but I go about serving, and begging miserably, I who was formerly raised in freedom." See how she weaves her own with his: "If his do not prevail," she says, "let mine prevail." Having said what is most pitiable—changing from house to house—not even there did she stop the laments, but added, saying: <i>"Waiting for the sun when it will set, that I may rest from my toils and the pains that hold me."</i> "For what is sweet to others," she says, "to see the light, this is heavy for me; but darkness is desirable. And the night, for this alone gives me rest from sweats, this becomes comfort for my evils; it encourages me and stops my toils, the day sending the sun to the west; for night knows how to heal wickedness, having darkness as its dwelling."</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">But having despaired in the misfortunes, and filled with devilish activity, she suggests to the righteous that this alone is left for him as a release from evils: release from the body; and this can come to him if he angers God through blasphemy, and provokes his own destruction. And she craftily introduces such counsel, constructing the argument both from her husband's misfortunes and her own. "The pains of childbirth," she says, "I endured, I toiled raising children, that after you, your memorial, the children, you might leave; the hope of these is cut off, all perished, males together with females; to whom shall I look henceforth? To you, the father of these, full of worms, the poor, the cast out? To me, the wretched, the wanderer, who from much happiness serve for hire, and until evening am examined in pains and toils? But if you obey me, utter some word to God, angering him, that he may take you; for this alone is left for you as a release from evils." Therefore she adds: <i>"But say some word to the Lord, and die."</i><sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup></span> Did you see here also the wickedness, how not even in the counsel itself did she immediately introduce the destructive advice, but first narrating the misfortunes piteously, and extending the tragedy, she places the advice in brief; and she does not show it clearly, but shading it, she holds out to him the release, most desirable, and promises death, which he especially desired. And consider from here the devil’s wickedness: since he knew Job’s love for God, he does not allow the wife to accuse God, lest he immediately turn away from her as an enemy; therefore she nowhere mentions him, but turns the events upside down.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">But you, after what is said, that a woman was the one giving this counsel, add that she is a clever orator enchanting those who do not pay attention. Many, even without misfortunes, have been led astray by the counsel of women alone; and here, as a stronger device than the preceding, he brings the wife to the righteous later; would that you had taken her also, O wicked one, would that you had buried her with the children. But some say the words are not even the wife’s, but he himself, struck into her, uttered these; for it was not likely that Job’s wife was such; unless one said, turned by the misfortune she became such. But it is likely that this was not the first counsel, but often the righteous heard much harsher things from the wife. And see the devil’s wickedness: he considered Eve—a woman, he says, brought down the first man, she will be able to prevail over this one also. But, O foolish one, finding that one weaker than the belly, she sowed her own poison, but this one you see philosophizing, and prevailing even over nature. He was not bent by loss of wealth, nor by untimely death of children, nor by unbearable torment of body, nor by such length of time; and do you expect to subdue by words one not taken by events? But the wife, after accurately narrating the tragedy, then brings the shameless counsel, and not even then does she say plainly, “Blaspheme”; for those advising wicked things do not dare to introduce the advice uncovered. What do you say, O woman? Ought to propitiate, ought to reconcile, do you rather advise to provoke? For if God did these things, one must beseech him, not blaspheme.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="verse-inline"><i>"But he looked at her and said, 'You have spoken like one of the foolish women.'"</i><sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup></span> Job, angered by these words, as by none of the former evils, and filling his gaze with anger, and turning to his wife as to an enemy, and looking at her bitterly, and before the voice, from his appearance he repelled the devices. For she expected to move springs of tears; but he became fiercer than a lion, filled with anger and indignation, not for what he suffered, but for what she advised devilishly; and showing the anger with his gaze, he makes the rebuke measured, for he was temperate even in misfortunes. And what does he say? “You have spoken like one of the foolish women.” “Not thus did I educate you,” he says, “not thus did I raise you; whence I do not recognize my cohabitant. For the counsel is of a foolish and erring woman.” “Set aside, O woman, the counsel; how long do you insult our common life in what you say? You lied, and you slandered my upbringing, as I did not wish, in what you spoke; and I have thought my life half destroyed now, since marriage made us one body, but you fell into blasphemy.” Did you see a fitting cut, and a sufficient blow to correct the disease? He did not say, “You are foolish and senseless,” but what? “You have spoken like one of the foolish women”; that is, “You uttered nothing worthy of yourself, nor of my education.” Then after the rebuke, he again introduces counsel, sufficient to comfort her, and having much reason, saying: <i>"If we have received good things from the hand of the Lord, shall we not endure evil things?"</i><sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></span> “Remember,” he says, “those former things, and consider the giver, and you will bear these also nobly.” Did you see the moderation of the man? For he does not reckon his endurance to his courage, but says it is from the sequence of events. For in return for what did God give us those things? What reward are you paying? None, but from goodness alone. For it was a gift, not a reward, and grace, not repayment; shall we not, then, bear these also nobly? Recall the good things that came before, balance the better against the worse. No one’s life is blessed throughout; to fare well always is God’s alone; but if you grieve for present things, comfort yourself from the past. Now you weep, but you laughed before; now you are poor, but you were rich before; having drunk the clear stream of life, and drinking this muddy one, endure; not even the currents of rivers appear pure throughout. And a river, as you know, is our life, flowing continually, and filled with successive waves; for part of it has already flowed, part is still going, part has just emerged from the springs, part is to come, and we all hasten to the common sea of death.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><i>"If we have received good things from the hand of the Lord, shall we not endure evil things?"</i><sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup></span> Do we compel the judge to provide the same things for us forever? Do we teach the Master how he must conduct our life? He has authority over his own judgments, to arrange our affairs as he wills; and he is wise, and measures what is expedient for his servants. Do not meddle with the Master’s judgment, only love what is arranged by his wisdom; whatever he gives you, receive with pleasure, show in painful things that you were worthy also of the former joy.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">Saying these things, Job repelled also this assault of the devil, and brought upon him the full shame of defeat. He showed through his gaze the greatest zeal against sin (for nature knew the eye as accuser of hidden things), and he who bore such an attack of the evil one gently and philosophically did not submit to the exhortation to wickedness, considering the wicked hearing worse than the body’s darts, and he rebuked the wife. “For as,” he says, “we received the treatment cheerfully, so let us bear the discipline soberly.” For he calls “good things” what gladdens, and “evil things” the temptations.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">And the phrase, “You have spoken like one of the foolish women,” some referred to Eve: “You imitated,” he says, “that first one who received the cloud of sin, and deceived with similar counsels that one honored as the image of God, and free from all wickedness.” For this blessed one, struck from all sides, stood more firmly, and receiving countless darts did not yield, but emptied the devil’s quiver, and he himself did not fall, nor was tripped; but as an excellent helmsman, neither when the sea raged and the waves were stirred was he sunk, nor when there was calm did he become more careless, but in each difference of times he preserved his skill equally. And neither did wealth puff him up, nor poverty humble him, nor when things flowed smoothly was he supine and relaxed, nor when almost the whole house was overturned and total ruin occurred was he troubled and disproved his own courage.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">Let the rich hear, let the poor hear, for the narrative is useful to both, and to all men a profitable history, both to those in prosperity and those in misfortunes. For handling both weapons, the champion of piety, the crown-bearer of the inhabited world, set up the trophy in both, and against every kind of war, that demon coming, he arrayed himself against all, and in all was proclaimed. And as a noble soldier, knowing how to fight by night, besiege walls, fight on foot, fight at sea, and shoot arrows, and brandish spear and slings and javelins, and prevail over the enemy in every manner of battle, and conquer everywhere; so indeed that noble one bore every temptation with much courage: that from poverty, that from hunger, that from sickness, that from pain, that from loss of children, that from friends, that from enemies, that from the wife, that from servants. For there was no human misfortune that was not poured out upon that body, but nevertheless he rose above all the nets, and became higher than the devil’s snares; and what is more marvelous, that all things came to him, and all with excess, and all at once. For do not only see that he suffered so much, but add that not little by little, nor at intervals, but at once and together; and this itself is no small addition of temptations. For each of the other men, first, none would be found enduring all at once, but if he wrestles with poverty, still he enjoys health; if he is afflicted with poverty and sickness, but often enjoyed a wife comforting the terrors, and becoming a harbor for him; if he did not enjoy such a wife, but not one advising destructively; if one advising destructively, but not also losing children suddenly; if also losing children, but not in such a manner of death; if also in such a manner, but a friend encouraging; if not a friend encouraging, but also enemies attacking; if also enemies attacking, but not also servants insulting; if also servants insulting, but not also spitting in his face; if also spitting in his face, but not also suffering such things; if also suffering such things, but enjoying house and furnishings, and not sitting on an ash heap; if also sitting on an ash heap, but having hands to help; if not having hands to help, but also being attacked; but this one endured all these. For to this man, afflicted from all sides, within, without, everywhere, the wife did those things, and gave the devil a pretext, and he shot at the righteous more bitter and destructive darts. And here the contests did not yet have an end, but still they were a prelude and beginning of the battle; and from friends he shot countless reproaches. Have you not heard of these successive misfortunes? But he did not hear. Who then will accuse our love if we endure again? For neither did we suffer all, nor another excess we endured. One thing indeed: that all human evils were poured into one body. Another: that all at once, and no one suffering had any respite. And a third addition: not only did he endure each of these, but also with much excess, and the keenest novelty; whether poverty, poverty more severe, whether sickness, whether seat, whether loss of children, whether loss of wealth. Consider: he lost wealth, but not thus utterly, nor in such manner. He lost children, but not always in bereavement, nor in such manner, nor in such number. He suffered sickness, but not of such kind, but fevers, and tertians, and some other common suffering. That one also endured fire and the bitterness of those sores, and the horror of those wounds. But enough of the works done, and the wounds of that body, to indicate the excess of the temptations. And the seat also was there, and there was no one, no one at all to help, not even any friend, since he was sitting upon the ash heap, deprived of all friends, stripped of servants, having a wife worse than any enemy. And the fourth excess: the loss of wealth, the reproaches, and the prosperity; for he had the beginning in poverty, much more brilliant than such things, since he practiced the labor; but prosperity had taken hold of him so greatly, because of the luxury and carelessness, more severe than poverty and more bitter than pain, and greater than any disturbance. And another excess: having stripped him of all friends, and made him destitute of those, and shot at him with darts and deprived his soul of breath. What is the cause of this? From the difference of times. For concerning grace, and concerning the manner of life, such things he philosophized, not having lost teachers, not having instructors, not books, no other such helper, not even being in the way, on the open sea, in such darkness of wickedness, alone and first then he cut that path of philosophy, shown to be the chief of goods with excess. For the greatest thing is also to accomplish the lesser parts of virtue, but much greater to be the greatest in the highest of all. And that the highest of all is endurance, no one will deny.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">This indeed the devil himself knowing, said: <i>"Skin for skin, and all that a man has he will give for his life. But stretch out your hand and touch his bones and his flesh."</i><sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup></span> Whence it is clear that this accomplishment is the highest of all, and requiring some youthful and iron soul. But I do not admire Job so much before the wife’s exhortation, as after that destructive counsel. And let no one think what is said to be paradoxical; for often those whom the nature of events did not trip, a word and corrupted counsel overthrew. This, then, the devil knowing, after the blow from the trial, he brings the assault through words. This he did also concerning David: for when he saw him bearing nobly the rebellion of his son and that unlawful tyranny, wishing to trip the mind and persuade him to fall into anger, he sent that Shimei, preparing him to bite his soul with bitter words. This he wrought also against Job: for when he saw him laughing at his darts, and standing nobly like an adamantine tower against all, he armed the wife, that the counsel might be unsuspected, and hid the poison in her words, and dramatized the misfortune.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">What then did the noble one do? <i>"You have spoken like one of the foolish women. If we have received good things from the hand of the Lord, shall we not endure evil things?"</i><sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup></span> “For if he were not Master,” he says, “nor so much above us, but some friend of equal honor, what excuse do we have, having received so many benefits, and not bearing the opposite?” Did you see a God-loving man, and how he does not think highly of himself, nor boast, for bearing nobly those blows beyond nature, nor does he think such endurance to be wisdom and magnanimity, but as paying a necessary debt, and having suffered nothing unfitting, thus from abundance he silenced the woman.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><i>"In all these things that happened to him, Job sinned nothing with his lips before God."</i><sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup></span> One cannot say, it says, that to the wife he said these things, but the secrets of his mind were full of anger and despair; but he uttered nothing even with his lips. The Hebrew does not have this, having sufficiently expressed the sense beforehand.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><i>"And hearing, his three friends all the evils that had come upon him, each came from his own country to him."</i><sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup></span> The three friends come to comfort, but they do the opposite of comfort; for the presence is friendly, but the counsel is not friendly; and even before their words, the sight alone is sufficient to cast down the righteous. For our own terrors we see more accurately in the goods of others. Consider how great it was to see himself in these things, and those familiar and known remaining in former prosperity. And the terrible thing is that the misfortune is spread everywhere; for if these, being so far away, heard, much more those nearby. But especially he was pained not by the magnitude of terrors, but by seeming to suffer as impious and lawless, as an enemy and foe of God, as having lived the former time in hypocrisy. He did not care for the body being destroyed, but for the glory being cast down; not because he was ambitious, or lived for the glory of the many, but because he saw many scandalized by these things.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">And the writer sets also the names of the friends, saying: <i>"And none of them spoke."</i><sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup></span> For a soul once struck by despondency is unfit for any hearing. Therefore these also, seeing the tragedy of that house, and the righteous sitting on the ash heap and ulcerated, tore their garments, and wailed greatly, and sat silently beside him; showing that nothing is so fitting at the beginning for the pained as quiet and silence; for the suffering was greater than comfort from words. They came to comfort, but not finding an image from which to comfort, they were silent; and this they did wisely, comforting him with deeds, with their presence, with tearing garments. But all these things are good, and worthy of friends, and signs of sympathy; but what follows, no longer.</p>
