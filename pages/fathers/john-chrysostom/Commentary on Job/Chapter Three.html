    <h1>Chapter Three</h1>

        <span class="verse-inline"><i>"After this Job opened his mouth."</i><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></span>

        <p class="paragraph">"After this" is placed accurately. For seeing many coming to him and going away again, he remained enduring in his sufferings; but when he beheld Eliphaz and his companions arriving with sincerity, and staying on at length—who even by their silence bore witness that what had happened was terrible, for they did not dare to console, unless he himself first gave the beginning—then indeed, thinking that he would become burdensome to them because of the silence, he breaks it. Let us see, then, what he utters upon opening his mouth. <span class="verse-inline"><i>"And he cursed his day, saying: Let the day perish in which I was born, and that night in which they said: Behold a male child."</i><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></span> Therefore, let us not examine the words simply, but see that they are spoken from a despondent soul; for if he had not uttered these things, he would have seemed not even to share in common nature. <span class="verse-inline"><i>"That night—let there be darkness, and let not God seek it out from above, nor let light come upon it; let darkness and the shadow of death seize it."</i><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></span> The righteous one, seeing how the heaviness of the events had called the friends, and understanding the burdensomeness of the blow, and judging their sitting with him for a long time to be oppressive (since it was not for such things that he previously associated with them), and, so to speak, seeing all things standing around him in opposition—he neither repels them senselessly, thinking it improper to send away with insult those who had come for honor, nor does he simply urge them to leave, out of respect for their friendship. But considering all these things, and being bitten by all, he came to these words, as if apologizing in a way to the friends: that he wishes to converse, but cannot, being weighed down by the multitude of terrible things. And what does he say? "Let that night be darkness," that is, let it be in obscurity, not remembered, nor let the Lord lay claim to it, nor let it be in the catalogue of nights. For since he was not speaking about an existing nature, or some living creature, he did not impose death or destruction, but that it have an extension opposite of day; as if the day were intercepted, by the extension of darkness to both nights, it would fall into forgetfulness for those wishing to count. <span class="verse-inline"><i>"For why did I not die in the womb? I came forth from the belly, and why did I not perish immediately?"</i><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></span> Therefore, just as Christ, saying: <i>"It were good for him if he had not been born,"</i> showed nothing else than that terrible and harsh things await him; so also here Job, saying: "Would that I had not been born," or "having been born, immediately perished," as if death were a companion to birth, does not revile the creation of God, but presents the magnitude of the calamity. Observe the reverence, how he pours out all his anger upon the day, not daring to overstep this boundary, but always saying these things: "the day," and "the night"; so that he may say, "As long as I was not tried by present evils, even if I did not receive the reward of piety." <span class="verse-inline"><i>"For now I would have lain down and been quiet, I would have slept; then I would have been at rest."</i><sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></span> And to me he seems also to restrain the friends, and to persuade them not to think human affairs a great thing. See, therefore, even in misfortune, words of philosophy. <span class="verse-inline"><i>"There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary are at rest."</i><sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></span></p>

        <p class="paragraph">But what are you saying? That I am impious and wicked? But did even these attain this comfort? Then, finally, a eulogy of death: that the one ceased from wickedness, the other was released from misery; the one found a harbor from terrors, the other a hindrance to wickedness; and the greatest thing, that there is no longer any expectation of former things, but they remain forever at rest upon their rest, because it is a release from all terrors. <span class="verse-inline"><i>"Together the prisoners are at ease; they do not hear the voice of the taskmaster."</i><sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></span> But according to the deeper meaning, the holy word blesses those who have not heard the voice of the taskmaster. For those who rise above the desires of the flesh, and trample on principalities, and conquer the spiritual hosts of wickedness, have become superior to the voice of the taskmaster, that is, of the devil, who, from those who have become voluntarily subject to him, demands, as a kind of tribute, to do the things pleasing to him. But the righteous, since they did not listen to him so as to do base things, for this reason flourish together in the kingdom of heaven. <span class="verse-inline"><i>"Small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master."</i><sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></span> Great, he says, is the inequality in the present life; great is the freedom and equality after the departure from here. There is no fear of change there, as here. Death is a hindrance of evils, a release from misery. The things that seem terrible are loosed; and he who long feared his own master, there he does not fear. All are there, small and great, that is, both he in honor and he in lowliness.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Here, then, these are not the words of one accusing—may it not be! For words not spoken with the same intention must not be understood in the same way—but of one grieving and seeking: <span class="verse-inline"><i>"Why is light given to those in bitterness, and life to souls in pain?"</i><sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup></span> Why do those about to be examined in misfortune enter into life? For to the rest, either illustrious in life or in health of body, this common passing of time brings some comfort; but those who partake of none of these, but only suffer misery in life—I know not what gain they will have by entering into life. And perhaps others benefit life in some way, but these, what? From this we learn that not only life, but also death has come to be useful, since it is so desirable. At any rate he adds: <span class="verse-inline"><i>"They long for death, and it does not come, digging for it as for treasures; they would rejoice exceedingly if they could attain the grave."</i><sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup></span> Therefore he says, <i>"To everything there is a season."</i> And again, <i>"O death, how bitter is the remembrance of you to a man living at ease in his possessions, to a man undisturbed, and prospering in all things, and still strong enough to receive food!"</i> And again, <i>"O death, your sentence is good to a man in need, and failing in strength, very old, and distracted about all things, and disobedient, and having lost patience."</i> Therefore Job also, being in misfortune, desires death and says these things, so that when you hear his wife counseling him, <i>"Say some word to the Lord, and die,"</i> you may not think that he did not speak out of love of life, but out of piety. For he who considers death so desirable for himself, and thinks it a great good, though it was possible to find it, did not dare. <span class="verse-inline"><i>"Death is rest for a man; for God has shut him in."</i><sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup></span> This is a declaration: If, then, it is rest, why do the many not run to it? For this reason God made life desirable to us, so that we might not run to death. <span class="verse-inline"><i>"For the fear which I feared has come upon me, and what I dreaded has happened to me."</i><sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></span></p>

        <p class="paragraph">This, then, was the reason why the righteous stood so bravely in such a storm and waves so violent: because when he was rich, he expected poverty; when he was healthy, he hoped for sickness; when he became the father of so many children, he hoped suddenly to be childless; and he always nourished this fear and agony within himself, knowing the nature of human affairs and considering their precariousness. Therefore he also said, <i>"The fear which I dreaded has happened to me."</i> And well did he say, <i>"has happened to me,"</i> as if to say, "To which I always came in my thoughts." For he always walked toward it in his mind, awaiting it, hoping and expecting it. For even if he continued living in wealth, luxury, and great splendor, yet every day he dreamed of others' misfortunes; therefore nothing troubled him when great and unbearable things befell. <span class="verse-inline"><i>"I was not at peace, nor quiet, nor at rest; yet trouble came."</i><sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup></span> He did not say, "I am not at peace, nor quiet"; but, "I was not at peace," in the past time. For even if he did luxurious things in what had gone before, yet the expectation of painful things did not allow him to be quiet, nor to revel in present things. Therefore, seeing those things which he had meditated in words happen in reality, he bore bravely what he had long practiced, and seeing these things present which had been anticipated by expectation, he was not astonished, nor troubled; but, "The expected anger," he says, "has come upon me," that is, the bitter and irremediable punishment, which I have experienced, which I also practiced by anticipation.</p>
