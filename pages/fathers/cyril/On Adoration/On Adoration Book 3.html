    <h1>On Adoration in Spirit and Truth, Book III</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">Of St. Cyril, Archbishop of Alexandria</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">That death followed upon sin, and that the tyranny of the devil cannot be avoided except through the sanctification which is from Christ; and that justification is not in the law, but in Christ.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now, when the Israelites had performed such a sacrifice, and moreover the firstborn of the Egyptians had perished, and Christ, as in a figure, had driven away the destroyer from the sanctified, then at last they departed from the land of their masters. And when they were hastening to the land promised to them, they were led to it not by a straight course, but by turnings to either side, diversions from the straight path. For thus it is written again: "But when Pharaoh had let the people go, God did not lead them by the way of the Philistines, because it was near. For God said: Lest perhaps the people repent when they see war, and return to Egypt. And God led the people around by the way of the wilderness to the Red Sea."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What then? Is a mystery hidden in this matter also?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> This must be inquired into, if it seems good. For you know that, although the way by which they might proceed directly to the place was at hand, and it was permitted to arrive quickly by a short journey (for the land of promise was undoubtedly near), He led them by another way, which was to be accomplished by a long detour; because He, the Maker of all, had foreseen long before that their soul was prone to fall away and too inclined to fear.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Nothing is more clear than this statement.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> We must therefore pass to spiritual contemplation. Those who ever depart from the region of Egypt, that is, from worldly life and demonic dominion, are led by a straight and altogether short way to sanctification, and to that hope which we have deposited in God; faith, I say, in Christ, and that justification in Him, as it is wisely said by the blessed Paul: "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that is, the word of faith which we preach: because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> God did not permit those ancient men to walk by this so near and short way, but devised, as it were, a certain circuit, not having a straight path, the law, I say, which through the intricacies and enigmas of prayer would have a longer and more laborious discipline. So that by using the things which were delivered in shadows, as by a certain meditation on perfect things, and being first initiated into the rudiments of the mystery, they might not be disturbed by any terrors and fall away from Christ, but being instructed by a certain exercise, when they had learned how useful the truth is, they might be rendered more ready to seek and eagerly lay hold of the truth, and might be firm and immovable in love towards God. The law, therefore, was a pedagogue,<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> which led, as it were, by a longer and winding way, through that worship, I say, which was exhibited according to the letter. But not so Christ. For He then showed us the short way, that, I say, through faith; and made us so bold that we no longer doubt to fight strongly against those things which oppose us, and we consider it foremost to be desired to endure something for the sake of the good itself, and to resist strongly the deceitful assaults of the devil, having that saying from the prophet in our mouth: "Behold, God is my helper; who will afflict me?"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Moreover, that which effects such wonderful boldness of soul in us is certainly nothing else than participation and communion in another virtue, that is, of the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I understand what you say, and I admire your skill.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And the very time of salvation to be given through Christ, I think, is signified by that which is immediately added: "For in the fifth generation," it says, "the sons of Israel went up from the land of Egypt."<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> For from the servitude and labors with which we are distracted in vain things, and also from the burdens which we bore in works of earth and dust (for you know what I mean), in the fifth succession of times, as in that evangelical parable, we are redeemed as if in a fifth generation. "For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard."<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> He says he did the same about the third, sixth, and ninth hour. "But about the eleventh he found others standing idle, and he said to them: Why do you stand here idle all day? Go, you also, into my vineyard."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Understand, therefore, that these last are sent into the vineyard in a certain fifth generation, that is, in the last times, when the Only-begotten was made man, and suffered death for the salvation of all. So also it was prescribed by the law of Moses that a lamb should be taken on the tenth day of the first month, but be killed towards evening on the fourteenth of the same month, so that at the same time both the fifth time of day and the event of our Savior's death, which was to be towards evening, might be signified.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, everything in the divinely inspired Scripture, as is fitting, pertains to the mystery of Christ?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Absolutely so; for Christ is the end of the law and the prophets.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> "For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved,"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> as that disciple of our Savior says; the proof of which is at hand, if we look at the things that follow: "Setting out from Succoth, the sons of Israel encamped in Etham, near the wilderness; and God went before them, indeed by day in a pillar of cloud, to show them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire; the pillar of cloud did not cease by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, before all the people."<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> You see how, when the Israelites had now set out from the region of the Egyptians, God presented Himself as their leader in a pillar of cloud and fire; and in both, Christ was represented.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> In what way, then?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> First, indeed, because a pillar is a firmament of truth; next, because it can in no way be shaken or disturbed, lifting up from the earth; for in Christ we cease to savor the things of the flesh and to wallow in earthly evils; and we are, as it were, lifted up by His help when we savor the things that are above and dwell in heaven: for it is written: "The mighty ones of God are mightily lifted up from the earth."<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> And certainly Christ also said by the voice of David concerning the earth and the holy apostles: "I have established its pillars."<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> For the holy apostles were established, who are eminent above the earth, since they are clothed with power from on high, namely the grace of the Holy Spirit. They were also pillars, for this very reason, that they were conformed to Christ and made like to Him through the grace of the Holy Spirit. Understand, therefore, in this way, that Christ is called a pillar for no other reason than those we have just mentioned. Moreover, He led them by day in the pillar of cloud, and by night, it says, in the pillar of fire, to show them the way.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> And Scripture is accustomed to call "night" that time before the Savior's advent, when, with Satan still dominating, those who were then on earth were held in the darkness of impiety and ignorance. But on the contrary, by the name "day" it calls that time when our Savior came: at which time we are illuminated, when we have received in our mind that splendor of the true knowledge of God, and we behold with the eyes of our heart the sun of righteousness, Christ. Paul testifies to this, where he speaks concerning the time both before the advent and that in the advent itself: "The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. Let us walk becomingly as in the day."<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> Therefore, since the old time is reckoned as night, and again that other time, in which the Only-begotten of God was made man, is reckoned as day, we assert that He presented Himself as leader to the Israelites indeed in the form of fire, as by a condemning and punishing law (for fire is a sign of punishment); but to us in the form of a cloud, as in a figure of holy baptism and that salvation which comes through water. For is not a cloud water?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Why not?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, when the sons of Israel had gone out from the region of the Egyptians, the old usurper, that is, Pharaoh, was kindled to anger, and attempted to pursue them. "For Pharaoh," it says, "harnessed his chariots, and took all his people with him, and took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the cavalry of the Egyptians, and leaders over all."<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> And after other things again: "And the sons of Israel, looking up with their eyes, saw, and behold, the Egyptians had encamped behind them, and they were very much afraid. And the sons of Israel cried out to the Lord, and they murmured against Moses openly, saying: Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have brought us out to kill us in the wilderness? Why have you done this to us, bringing us out of Egypt? Is this not the word which we spoke to you in Egypt, saying: Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it was much better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in this wilderness."<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> To these things Moses said: "Take courage, stand firm, and see the salvation from the Lord which He will work for you today. For as you have seen the Egyptians today, you will not add to see them again forever. The Lord will fight for you, and you will be silent."<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> And the Lord said to Moses: "Why do you cry to me? Speak to the sons of Israel, and let them set out. And you, lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and dry it up. And let the sons of Israel enter into the midst of the sea on dry ground."<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> And God made the manner of help clear: "For the angel of God," it says, "who was going before the camp of the sons of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud also moved from before them, and stood behind them. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel, and it stood, and there was darkness and gloom. And the night passed, and they did not come near one another all that night."<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> And these things the narrative of the history recounts to us. But I think it is worthwhile, applying a subtle mind to the things written, to look again into the accuracy of the meanings.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I certainly think so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The sons of Israel, therefore, set out hastening to the holy land, with God going before and leading as in a pillar of fire and cloud; for it is in no way permitted to arrive at that supernal holy city except with Christ as leader, who makes the way clear for us. Yet the enemies who are in this world gnash their teeth against those who have decided to do this; but the law exhorts and confirms those struck by fear to be boldly courageous, and declares most manifestly that the cohort of adversaries will fall: for from the fact that the Egyptians were taken away from the midst, this is undoubtedly signified; and God saved those who were terrified by the impending evil, as again in a figure of holy baptism. "For speak," He says, "to the sons of Israel, and let them set out. And you, take up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and dry it up; and let the sons of Israel enter into the midst of the sea."<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> What? Does not the divine Paul write concerning the sons of Israel that they were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea?<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I admit it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is necessary, therefore, that those who desire to follow Christ and hasten to that supernal city should not remain in the law, nor firmly cling to the commandments given through Moses, and dwell in shadows and figures; but they should set out and pass over to another place, namely to holy baptism. For those ancient men did this, who by God's command entered through the midst of the waves, and, as Paul says, were baptized in the sea. For they will finally have as their helper God Himself, the mediator between God and men, Christ Jesus. For the Word, being God, was made flesh; who is also mediator in another respect, namely in the manner of governing, as He who is accustomed to go in the midst between His worshippers and their persecutors, and does not permit them to engage with one another, and prohibits the enemies from attacking. "For the angel of God," it says, "and the pillar of the cloud moved and entered between the camp of Israel and the camp of the Egyptians, and they did not come near one another all that night."<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> And again, Christ is signified in the angel and in the pillar of the cloud; for His name is called "the Angel of great counsel."<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, when Christ is placed as a mediator between, we do not join battle with those who desire to attack us.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> So it is; you understand correctly. Nevertheless, I will say this, and in my opinion, I think, he will not err who says that if we have decided to depart, overcome by the pleasurable and worldly life, and have determined to follow the laws of God with the utmost zeal, yet we have not yet obtained the grace of holy baptism, we will certainly not be sufficiently strong or prepared to endure troubles, and to undergo labors for the sake of virtue, and to bear the dangers of wars. For just as tender little trees refuse to bear the most vehement rays of the sun, and are somewhat injured if they are shaken by a more violent blast of winds, and therefore have absolute need of some aids from art and a protection with which they may be surrounded, so, I think, also the soul of man, which has recently emerged from the servitude of vices and has come to a better way of life, and wishes to follow the law of God, is still delicate and rather soft, so that when it sees the sweat and labor of the fight, terrified by fear, it will easily turn its back, and will think it desirable to return to the things in which it previously dwelt. Therefore the Israelites, when they saw the array of the Egyptians, and had cast down their spirits at the mere sight of battle, rose up against Moses, saying: "Is this not the word which we spoke to you in Egypt, saying: Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it was better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in this wilderness."<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> The soul of man, therefore, before holy baptism is unwarlike and prone to fear, and of such a kind that it can be very easily deterred. But if it has now become a partaker of His grace, and has put on that virtue from on high, then it will resist most strongly those who desire to persecute it, and will fight strenuously; and it will also most easily repel the attack of the enemies, with Christ then both as leader and defender. For we will not be victorious in any other way than by this one means.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> See, therefore, with what examples you will confirm this; for I do not think a supply of them will be lacking to you.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is indeed very easy to demonstrate this with very many examples; nevertheless, the first will be that which is both nearest and which Moses himself committed to writing. For those who had despaired in spirit at the mere sight of the Egyptians, after they had crossed the Red Sea and fulfilled the figure of holy baptism (for they were baptized into Moses, as Paul most wisely writes,<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup> in the cloud and in the sea), now showed themselves strong and strenuous in resisting the enemies; yet not without Christ. For thus it is written: "Then Amalek came and fought against Israel in Rephidim. And Moses said to Joshua: Choose for yourself powerful men, and go out and fight against Amalek tomorrow; and behold, I will stand on the top of the hill, and the rod of God in my hand. And Joshua did as Moses said to him, and went out and fought against Amalek: and Moses, and Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. And it came to pass, when Moses lifted up his hands, Israel prevailed; but when he let down his hands, Amalek prevailed. But the hands of Moses were heavy; and they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it, and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other; and the hands of Moses were steady until the setting of the sun. And Joshua routed Amalek and all his people with the edge of the sword. And the Lord said to Moses: Write this for a memorial in a book, and you shall put it in the ears of Joshua; for I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. And Moses built an altar to the Lord, and called the name of it, The Lord is my refuge; because with a hidden hand the Lord fights against Amalek from generation to generation."<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And what is the meaning of this scripture? For I do not sufficiently understand.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Yet, as I think, there is nothing difficult for those willing to look into it; for if anyone considers that Joshua was commanded by Moses, what else can he suspect than that very thing, that, since the Word was God, He was made under the law, which pertains to the condition of humanity, and was in a certain way subject to the commands of Moses? And this in many ways: now enduring circumcision, that which is according to the flesh; now paying the didrachma;<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup> besides, numbering Himself with those who were under the law, as if under the law, and saying most openly: "I have not come to destroy the law, but to fulfill it."<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> But, although He was made under the law on account of human nature, yet even then He was God, and the savior and redeemer of the whole people. For when He had chosen powerful men from the whole people of Israel and from every nation, the holy apostles, I say, and those who are called through faith, to whom it can rightly be said: "But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for His own possession,"<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup> He fought together with these against the prince of this world; concerning whom the Lord Himself, who conquers all things, says: "Now is the judgment of this world; now the prince of this world will be cast out."<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup> The divine man John also bestows the crown with another excellent testimony of his own upon those who have conquered with Him and through Him: "I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and have overcome the evil one."<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup> Is what I say not true?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Most certainly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And Moses said that they were to fight with the enemy on the next day;<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> for the glorious deeds of Christ did not happen in his times, but were accomplished in the following and proximate time, that is, after Moses and after the law. Then Moses went up onto a certain hill and the summit of a mound, so that from there he might watch the battle and the successful deeds of Joshua in fighting. For he lifted up a little also that discipline of the law, to the point that we can, as from a distance, behold the imperial actions of Christ. Then, when Moses lifted up his hands, Israel was stronger; when he let them down, Israel grew weak and Amalek prevailed. For not only all Israel, but also whoever have considered it excellent to be conformed to Christ, bearing His reproach, that is, His venerable cross, can in no way be conquered by the devil or any other enemy, however desirous of conquering. For the hands stretched out into the air not obscurely describe the figure of the cross. But whoever have not taken up the cross, these, because they lacked this helper, have feared the incursions of the enemies. That, therefore, Moses stretched out his hands, showing the figure of the cross, and Amalek fell, weakened, this matter, I think, signifies those who through that venerable cross bind Satan and grow strong against the enemies. But when we see him letting down the same hands, and Amalek again growing strong, we will consider those who, because they were unwilling to receive the cross, were overcome and conquered by the devil, to whom Christ also spoke when He said: "Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins."<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup> Furthermore, that the hands of Moses were heavy, and lifted with difficulty, and stretched out to show the excellent figure of the cross only with great effort, this, I think, figuratively signifies that Israel was not sufficiently prepared to receive faith, and descended to take up the reproach of Christ not without hesitation and with difficulty. And for this reason the blessed Paul rightly calls the cross a stumbling block to the Jews.<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup> "And they took," it says, "a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side, and the other on the other."<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> Now the precious, chosen, cornerstone, tested, is Christ,<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> upon whom resting (for sitting signifies rest), those who are from Israel and are more obedient and docile, those, I say, the remnant according to the election of grace, stretch out their hands, that is, take up the cross, with Christ confirming and sustaining them, who is signified through Hur and Aaron, and is understood as both judge and high priest. For Hur was a most upright judge; but Aaron was the high priest. Therefore, one and the same Christ is, as it were, in both, judge and high priest, who sustains the remnant of the sons of Israel made by the election of grace unto that salvation which is by faith. For I think this is signified by those words which were said through the prophetic voice of Isaiah: "And unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have been made like Gomorrah."<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> When, therefore, he who resisted, Amalek, I say, had fallen, "Write," He says, "this for a memorial in a book, and you shall put it in the ears of Joshua."<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup> For those glorious deeds of Christ were to be commended to lasting and eternal memory by the writings of the holy evangelists. He also commanded that these writings be given into the ears of Joshua: for by the monuments of the holy men, they are, as it were, select gifts and as praises and proclamations dedicated to Christ. Therefore, when Amalek was routed and conquered, Moses erects an altar to God, and gives it this name: "The Lord is my refuge."<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup> This very thing also presents the figure of Christ. For He has become our Lord and refuge, when He has vanquished the prince of this world, and trodden under foot the empire of death, and offered Himself for us as an immaculate victim in an odor of sweetness to God the Father. That altar, therefore, was a figure of Christ, to whom the fitting and true name is, "The Lord is my refuge."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I agree; for you seem to think most excellently.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, the war having been waged against the spiritual Amalek with a hidden hand, and he having been conquered, Christ has subdued the nations, and having bound the strong one, as He Himself says, He has plundered his vessels.<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup> For He has joined the flock, which was once under his dominion, the Gentiles, I say, with the ancient flocks, and therefore He said: "And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice, and there will be one flock, one shepherd."<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup> Moreover, Christ is our peace, according to the Scriptures, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition, and has abolished in His flesh the enmity, the law of commandments in decrees,<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup> and has reconciled into one new man both those from the circumcision and those outside the law. Now I would like you to consider again this great mystery, as in a shadow and enigma, which is immediately added to the things we have just said. "For Jethro, the priest of Midian, the father-in-law of Moses, heard all that God had done for Israel His people; for the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt. And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, took Zipporah, the wife of Moses, after he had sent her away, and her two sons; the name of one was Gershom, saying: I have been a sojourner in a foreign land; and the name of the second was Eliezer, saying: For the God of my father is my helper, and He delivered me from the hand of Pharaoh. And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness, where he was encamped at the mountain of God. And it was told to Moses, saying: Behold, your father-in-law Jethro comes to you, and your wife and your two sons with him. And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down to him, and kissed him, and they embraced one another, and he brought him into his tent. And Moses told his father-in-law all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the hardship that had come upon them on the way, and that the Lord had delivered them out of the hand of Pharaoh and out of the hand of the Egyptians. And Jethro was astonished at all the good things that the Lord had done for them, that the Lord had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh. And Jethro said: Blessed be the Lord, who has delivered His people out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh; now I know that the Lord is great above all gods, because of the thing in which they dealt proudly against them. And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God; and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with the father-in-law of Moses before God. And it came to pass on the next day that Moses sat to judge the people; and all the people stood around Moses from morning until evening. And Jethro, seeing all that he was doing for the people, said: What is this thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you from morning until evening? And Moses said to his father-in-law: Because the people come to me to inquire of God. For when they have a dispute, they come to me, and I judge between one and another, and I make known to them the statutes of God and His law. And the father-in-law of Moses said to him: You do not do this thing rightly; you will surely wear away, both you and this people that is with you; for this thing is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone. Now therefore listen to me, and I will give you counsel; be for the people in those things which pertain to God, and you shall bring their words to God, and you shall testify to them the precepts of God and His law, and you shall show them the way in which they must walk and the works that they must do. And you shall provide for yourself from all the people able men," he says, "and they shall judge the people."<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup> And with some things interposed, again: "And Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said to him."<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Proceed, therefore, again for me, and explain, distributing the particulars part by part.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do you not confess that Jethro was a foreigner, and a man from the Gentiles, a Midianite? For he is not descended from the stock of Abraham. He was also, moreover, a priest and worshipper of that religion which was widespread throughout the world at that time. For they used to worship, as is celebrated in the discourse of many, and they themselves thought, the most high God, as indeed also Melchizedek; but they also received other gods, and together with Him they referred to the number of gods the excellent creatures, I mean the earth and heaven, the sun and moon, and the more notable stars; and in this matter a blemish and error was an ancient vice indeed, but one which has come down and spread even to our times. For thus even now some foolish men in Phoenicia and Palestine think, who, although they call themselves religious, yet enter upon a middle way of religion, being devoted neither wholly to the customs of the Jews nor to those of the Gentiles, but in a certain way tossed and divided between both. And the prophet Elijah once rebuked Israel, when they began to think in the same way, with these words: "How long will you limp on both knees? If Baal is God, follow him; but if the Lord is God, follow him."<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup> It is likely, therefore, that Jethro also was of some such form of religion of those sects. Who, after he learned the things that had proceeded from God for the purpose of bestowing salvation upon the Israelites, being attracted by the magnificent and admirable narratives, came to Moses with his whole house and all his kindred. He, when he had gladly seen him, received him, and brought him into his own tent, and set forth accurately those glorious deeds of divine virtue and wonderful works, which surpass all force of speech. Therefore, a crowd of erring ones, the Gentiles, I say, are called from a false opinion to that which leads to God. And first, indeed, from the fact that they hear something about God; then they themselves, of their own accord, in a certain way run to the law of God, that is, to the institution of the sacred Scriptures. Therefore they also hasten to the first tabernacle; for the law has the force of introduction; then, persuaded by those more ancient narratives, they come at last to this opinion, that they believe God is one and only, and that offerings ought to be dedicated to Him. For when Moses heard the narration, that Midianite said, "Now I know that the Lord is great above all gods; because they dealt proudly against them." And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God.<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup> There is, therefore, a certain elementary teacher, and at the first approaches of true knowledge of God, Moses leads us, that is, that catechesis and introduction of the sacred Scriptures of the Hebrews.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> That is certain.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But Christ makes perfect those who have been instructed through the law; and by that law, understand again the Old Testament. And so, towards Jethro, Moses used only narrations about God, and had brought him to that opinion, so that he might confess in clear words that there is no other God, but only He who is one in being and nature, and truly God. This, moreover, is the first faith of catechumens: to depart from the opinion of many gods, and to embrace that one, true and natural God. Aaron himself deems Jethro worthy of his table, and invites him to eat bread. "For let Aaron come," he says, "and all the elders of Israel to eat bread with the father-in-law of Moses before God."<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> For Christ makes us perfect with the living bread; and Aaron, the more perfect, makes perfect not only the Gentiles, but rather promiscuously those who are chosen from the race of Israel, whose figure the elders hold. Nor does that which must be eaten as in the sight of God bear a small signification of sanctification. For what is so under the eyes and sight of God as the mystical members, and the sacrifice, and those who become partakers of it?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Now indeed we, who are perfected in Christ, come to a greater wisdom than that which was acquired through the institution of the law; we shall see this clearly if we receive a perspicuous image of the matter: Moses and Jethro. "For Moses sat," it says, "judging"; but all the people stood around him from morning until evening.<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup> Moreover, Jethro is the author of that opinion which Moses followed; and when he understood it to be best, he embraced it. "For Moses heard the voice of his father-in-law, and did whatever he said to him."<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup> For what? He who could give better counsel and speak a better opinion, is he not to be thought to excel in prudence in every way?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I agree.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But that this perfection through Christ is more excellent and far superior to that institution of the law, as it lifts us to that knowledge which is far superior; this the most blessed Paul easily shows, who, on account of the eminent knowledge of Christ, as he himself says, most willingly makes a loss of those things which were gains in the law, and counts them as dung, that he may gain Christ.<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup> And against those indeed who still thought great things which were delivered through Moses alone, and rejected the perfection which is acquired through the doctrine of Christ, the prophet Jeremiah said: "How do you say, We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? In vain has the false pen of the scribes been made; the wise men were ashamed, they were terrified and taken; what wisdom is in them, because they have rejected the word of the Lord?"<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup> But to us, who do not reject the saving word (for we willingly embrace the preaching of Christ), He Himself has been made wisdom from God.<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup> We have therefore surpassed even in understanding those who are in the law, and we who are instructed by the narratives of the law, after eating the bread in the sight of God, have been taught both to speak and to think better things. For Jethro gives counsel, and Moses obeys. And it is fitting that Jethro, as it were, bears the person of those from the Gentiles, but Moses of those according to the law.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, that perfection which is bestowed through Christ, and the power of His mysteries, both makes us wise and shows us stronger than death, overthrowing that hidden and spiritual Amalek, that is, Satan. And rightly indeed that Psalmist said: "For in God we shall do valiantly; and He will bring to nothing those who afflict us."<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup> Concerning us also, who are adorned with the splendor of faith, he said, turning his voice to God: "For the glory of their strength You are, and in Your name they shall rejoice all the day."<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup> For we rejoice in Christ, when we are saved, and we have Him, as it is in the Scriptures: "The shield of good will."<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup> The figure and perspicuous image of this matter can be again for us, that which is written at the end of the second book of Kings; the words are as follows: "And David rose up in the morning, and the word of the Lord came to Gad the prophet, the seer of David, saying: Thus says the Lord, I propose three things against you, David; choose one of them, and I will do it to you. And Gad came to David, and announced and said to him, saying: Choose for yourself that there should be, or that there should come to you, three years of famine upon your land; or three months that you should flee from the face of your enemies, and they should pursue you; or that there should be death for three days in your land. Now therefore deliberate, and see what word I shall answer Him who sent me. And David said to Gad: I am in straits on every side exceedingly by these three things; let me fall then into the hands of the Lord, for His mercies are very many; but into the hands of men let me not fall. And David chose for himself death: and it was the days of wheat harvest, and the Lord gave death in Israel from the morning until the hour of dinner: and the destruction began among the people, and there died of the people from Dan to Beersheba seventy thousand men: and the angel of God stretched out his hand against Jerusalem to destroy it: and the Lord relented concerning the evil, and said to the angel who was destroying among the people: It is enough now; withhold your hand. And the angel of the Lord was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. And David spoke to the Lord, when he saw the angel striking the people, and said: Behold, I am the shepherd; I have sinned: and I the shepherd have done wickedly; and these sheep, what have they done? Let Your hand be against me and against the house of my father. And Gad came to David on that day, and said to him: Go up, and set up an altar in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. And David went up according to the word of Gad the prophet, as the Lord had commanded him: and Ornan looked, and saw the king and his servants passing over towards him: and Ornan went out, and worshipped the king with his face to the ground. And Ornan said: Why has my lord the king come to his servant? And David said: To buy from you the threshing floor, to build an altar to the Lord, that the destruction may be restrained from the people. And Ornan said to David: Let my lord the king take and offer to the Lord what is good in his eyes: behold, the oxen for a burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the yokes of the oxen for wood. Ornan gave all to the king. And Ornan said to the king: The Lord your God bless you. And the king said to Ornan: Not so; but I will surely buy it from you for a price, and I will not offer to the Lord my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing. And David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver; and David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And Solomon afterwards enlarged the altar, because it was small at first; and the Lord heard the earth, and the destruction was restrained from Israel."<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What meaning then is to be thought to be in these words? For the contemplation of this passage is indeed difficult.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is plainly difficult, and truly of such a kind that it can scarcely be perceived. Nevertheless, I will say this, gathering the external sense, as it were, of the proposed Scripture into a few points, and transferring it to the inner meaning. Consider therefore, Palladius, as in a mirror and in faint images, the mystery of Christ, and the manner of our dispensation.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You yourself will provide this excellently, God supplying the ability to understand.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Hear then. For I will now proceed to speak. By divine wrath, death was allotted to devour the people of God, and until the hour of dinner, with no one forbidding, the destroyer grew strong. But when he was about to send his hand against Jerusalem, God forbade him; and when David saw the angel, he besought the Lord that he had sinned, saying: it is better and more just that the shepherd and leader should undergo death rather than the sheep, which had sinned nothing: then, at God's command, he erected an altar in the threshing floor of Ornan, which he had bought with the oxen for threshing for fifty shekels. But after he built the altar, he offered sacrifices upon it, namely burnt offerings and peace offerings; the destruction ceased in the following time, and that previously grievous death was restrained. Moreover, Holy Scripture noted that altar was small at first, but was enlarged afterwards by Solomon. Do you admit, therefore, that in these words the external sense of the proposed passage is contained very briefly?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I admit it, but explain how the understanding of this passage can be made clearer.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Are you ignorant of the nature of man, which, by common agreement, fell headlong into death and into the earth, because it had provoked its Maker to anger, in the very beginning of our race, that is, in Adam? Who, when he had despised the divine command from the beginning, heard: "You are dust, and to dust you shall return."<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak the truth.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> From the morning, therefore, that is, from the first times of this world, death devoured those who were on the earth, until the hour of dinner, that is, until the time of the meal. For when the holy time of the meal came to us, namely that mystical one in Christ, in which we eat that bread given from heaven and vital, death, which was previously terrible and which could scarcely be resisted, ceased, God being recalled to mercy, when the destroyer was with difficulty restrained: who, when he wished to send his pestilential hand also against those who dwell in the holy city, namely in the spiritual Jerusalem, God being moved to mercy, was at last with difficulty restrained, "Withhold now," He says, "it is enough."<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup> Moreover, the holy city is the Church, whose inhabitants I think are those who are perfected unto sanctification by that living bread. Of this august and admirable city that divine David makes mention, saying: "Glorious things are spoken of you, city of God."<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup> For Christ, who is life and gives life, dwelt in us; wherefore, driving away the destroyer from the sanctified, He does not permit him to conquer any more, since that holy time of the meal has come, which the time of dinner secretly signifies. Christ, therefore, who is understood in the person of David, delivered us. For, after He saw those on earth being consumed by death, He became the Paraclete and Advocate for us to the Father; for He offered Himself for us, and willingly subjected Himself to death, and restrained the destroyer, saying that the sin was His own; not that He Himself committed sin, but that, according to the Scriptures, "He Himself bore our sins, and suffers for us, and was numbered with the transgressors,"<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup> although He knew no sin, "and was made a curse for us."<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup> But it is more just that the shepherd should pay the penalty rather than the sheep: for as the good shepherd He laid down His life for the sheep.<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup> Then, by divine admonition, the blessed David, when he saw the destroying angel now ceasing and standing (for he saw him near the threshing floor, it says), there, having fixed the altar, he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings (moreover, these are kinds according to the prescription of the law, and modes of sacrifices) to God. And by the threshing floor you will understand the Church, to which when He had come, the destroyer stood, and was destroyed; and that previously violent and devastating hand was withdrawn; for it is the house of that life which is life by its own nature, that is, of Christ. But we call the Church a threshing floor from a certain image and likeness, because in it, in the manner of sheaves and ears of grain, those who are from the secular life are harvested by the preaching of the holy reapers, that is, of the apostles and evangelists, so that they may be gathered into those upper halls, and as into the Lord's barn, they may be brought into that heavenly Jerusalem as purified wheat, having laid aside useless and superfluous not only actions, but also thoughts of the mind, which are understood as in a certain image of chaff. Moreover, it was said by Christ to the holy apostles: "Do you not say, There are yet four months, and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you: Lift up your eyes, and see the fields, that they are already white for harvest. And he who reaps receives a reward, and gathers fruit for eternal life;"<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup> and again: "The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He send laborers into His harvest."<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup> The harvest, I think, He called the multitude of those who were to believe: but the holy reapers He said are those who have the divine word in mind and tongue, "which is living and effectual, and more piercing than any two-edged sword, and reaching unto the division of soul and spirit, of the joints also and the marrow..."<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup> Moreover, by the name of threshing floor, the blessed Baptist also signified the Church, when he said thus of Christ: "I indeed baptize you with water; but He who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie: He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire: whose winnowing fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the barn, but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire."<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup> This spiritual threshing floor, the Church, I say, Christ bought for fifty shekels, that is, not for a small price; for He gave Himself for it, and in it He fixed the altar: and since He was both priest (for He was made a high priest<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup>), and the victim, He offered Himself, as in the species and figure of a threshing ox, and became a burnt offering and a peace offering. For that middle wall was broken down through Christ,<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup> and we who were once separated and set apart by the guilt of sin, through Him and in Him are joined with God and the Father, those ancient enmities being destroyed: "For He Himself is our peace,"<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup> as the Scriptures testify.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Are we therefore to understand the threshing ox as Christ? In what way finally?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Indeed, Palladius, did not the law of Moses call the holy disciples by the name of threshing oxen? For thus it says through someone: "You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain."<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup> Which very thing, when the blessed Paul had most evidently understood, he says: "Is God concerned about oxen? Or does He say it altogether for our sake? For it was written for our sake, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing."<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup> Therefore, the oxen, according to the image of the first, that is, of Christ, are also the blessed disciples. But in another way, Christ is the threshing ox: for through Him comes purification and the laying aside of superfluous things, of distractions, I say, and of worldly carnal thoughts, which are also food for flames, just as chaff. But with the altar raised, upon which both the peace offering and the burnt offering were placed, the present evil was removed: for the Lord heard the earth, and the destruction was restrained. For after Christ offered Himself as a priest for us, death was abolished, destruction was overturned, with God Almighty now in a way offering His ear ready to the prayers of all: "While you are still speaking," He says, "I will say, Here I am."<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup> But that it is said that the altar was indeed small at first, but was enlarged afterwards, signifies the progression of the Gospel to come in its own times, and the narrowness of the holy Churches at the beginning, but their amplitude in subsequent time. For the altars are widened, as it were, continually, as other Churches are always added to the first, and the peoples grow into an immeasurable multitude, who have been redeemed through the sacrifice of Christ, and have Him as both priest and holy victim, and a sweet-smelling purifier, and as a worthy altar, and as the master in the image of the threshing floor of the Church.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How clear and evident the discourse is! For it is skillfully composed.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For did not you yourself, without any doubt, say that Christ is the life and redemption of all?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I would say so, indeed. For I think thus.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For one died for all, who was worth all; and He made His soul an exchange for ours: by which deed He put to shame the perversity of the devil, and in a way stood against the descent of the sin that tyrannizes over us, and the unbridled tongue concerning the faults of all.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> In what way do you say?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For since sin reigned over those on earth, with many being inclined to evil from youth, as it is written,<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup> and the hearts of all diligently pressing on to will and to do those things, we necessarily fell and were under the sentence of death. For the transgression of the divine law, and the setting aside of the Lord's will, has death as its penalty. But the Creator had mercy on the thus corrupted nature of man; and the Only-begotten became man, and bore a body naturally subject to death, and became flesh, that by enduring for us the death that was attached to us from sin, He might destroy sin, and put an end to the accusations of Satan: since in Christ Himself we have paid the penalty of the sins for which we were accused; "for He takes away our sins, and suffers for us"<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup> according to the voice of the prophet. For were we not healed by His bruise?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak the truth. "For He was wounded for our transgressions, and He was in affliction and in plague..."<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Sin, therefore, was taken away from the midst, after Christ suffered for us, nor hereafter, I think, will it cry out violently against those who are sanctified through Christ: and this the prophet Zechariah will make clear to us as if through a vision, saying: "And the angel who spoke in me went out, and said to me: Lift up your eyes, and see this that goes out. And I said: What is that? And he said: This is the measure that goes out. And he said: This is their iniquity in all the earth. And behold, a talent of lead was lifted up, and behold, a woman sitting in the midst of the measure, and he cast a stone of lead into her mouth: and I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, two women coming out, and the wind was in their wings, and these had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the measure between the earth and the heaven: and I said to the angel who spoke in me: Where do these carry the measure? And he said to me: To build for it a house in the land of Babylon, and to prepare, and to set it there in its preparation."<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup> Do you wish that we discuss the particulars again, and, as far as we are able, consider them?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very much so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The prophet saw a certain measure that was going out from Jerusalem, and asking what that was, the angel responded: "This is their iniquity in all the earth."<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup> Which is as if he had said, By this measure all sins are weighed, whatever are committed through the whole earth in each and every time. For when our sins have reached a manifest magnitude, then indeed the offended lawgiver exacts penalties from us; but often He tolerates in a certain benignity, and bears with sinners; nor, before the measure is filled, does He pour out all His wrath. Thus He said to Abraham: "For the sins of the Amorites are not yet filled up until now."<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup> But to the Pharisees, who had offended Him excessively, Christ said: "And you fill up the measure of your fathers."<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup> The measure, therefore, proceeding, a talent of lead is lifted up, and is thrown into the mouth of the woman who was to fill the measure, who also received the stone of lead in her mouth; then that divine angel said: This is iniquity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> This passage of Scripture is not yet sufficiently clear.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But it will be, and not long after: for the talent of lead is Christ Himself, I think, who is lifted up, that is, exalted through the cross, and is seen distinguished by the dignity of divinity: for God exalted Him above all things and gave Him the name which is above every name.<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup> And He stops the mouth of iniquity, according to that which is sung in the Psalms: "And all iniquity shall stop its mouth;"<sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup> because it is prevented from crying out against those who have sinned from weakness, and are justified by faith. "For God is He who justifies; who is he who condemns?"<sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup> Therefore, since Christ suffered for us, how would it be consistent that the penalties of our sins should be exacted also from us ourselves?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Most rightly said. For we are justified in Christ, and we have repelled the cry and accusation of sin against us. But you will make it most pleasant if you teach for what reason Christ is signified by the figure of lead; and the person of a woman indicates iniquity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But indeed it is not difficult to perceive this from the sacred Scriptures; for Christ is foreshadowed by many images of other things also, since from the quality of the things signified, the properties which are in Him are understood.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But what is that which you say?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> He was made for us a certain base and firmness, and an immovable step, and a solid foundation: for that reason He is called a stone. "For behold," He says, "I lay in the foundations of Zion a chosen stone, a precious cornerstone. And he who believes in Him will not be put to shame."<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup> Again, the same is the excellent and admirable treasure of the Church, our spiritual riches; and so He is called a pearl. "For the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls; who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it."<sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup> He also joined us through Himself to God and the Father, the enmities being slain in His body, as it is written,<sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup> and therefore to the Father, who is in heaven, and God concerning those who were justified by faith, by which they believed in Him, He said: "Father, I will that, as I and You are one, so they also may be one in Us."<sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup> For this reason He is called a tin stone, because things that are to be joined are joined with tin. But God certainly spoke through the mouth of Zechariah, when He showed His Son to us as about to come and be present at some time, "And they shall see, and shall see the tin stone in the hand of Zerubbabel."<sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup> In the same manner, therefore, in this place also He calls Him a talent of lead. But what the reason of this matter is, I will say again. If base silver is melted together with lead, it is excellently purified: for the lead, by the force of its nature, seizes and carries off the dross of the melted metal: not unlike was that which Christ fulfilled concerning us ourselves. For to us, who were base, He was mixed not in a bodily way, but spiritually; and thus He melted away the dross that was in us. For He takes away our sins, that we may be pure and splendid because of Him and through Him. And certainly the prophet Jeremiah complains concerning the Jewish peoples who rejected the purification which is perfected through Christ, saying: "The bellows have failed from the fire, the lead has failed, the smelter melts in vain; for their wickednesses are not consumed. Call them reprobate silver, because the Lord has rejected them."<sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup> Do you understand, therefore, that the divine Scripture was not ignorant that the purification of silver cannot be done without lead? Therefore, because we, who were reprobate, were purified by Christ, for that reason He is figured by lead. And the same stops the mouth of iniquity, which is indicated by the figure of a woman: and a woman is a mark of weakness and also of pleasure. Moreover, all iniquity is committed through these two; when first the mind is corrupted by some pleasure, which it has perceived from this or that thing, then, enfeebled, it remits those labors which lead to virtue, and the human soul slips into sin: and so certain ones are said to be lovers of pleasure rather than of God.<sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup> The prophet also addresses those who were languishing with the disease of sin and vicious dissolution from weakness of soul: "Strengthen the weak hands, and the feeble knees."<sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But enough about this. But that pair of women, who carry the measure and the iniquity into the region of Babylon, what does it mean? Or what does it signify?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The mouth of iniquity is blocked, Palladius, through Christ; we are not in it, and we are freed from its accusation, and that accusation of iniquity against us has quieted down. For He who died for us, according to us, and for us, and rose again, had this end of His whole dispensation proposed; for it was not right that life should succumb to death. But some did not believe the Gospel of Christ; and therefore, since they did not wish to be redeemed from sin, no wonder if they again bear the burden of their sin, which they imposed on their own necks by the weakness of reason, and the languor of mind, and the softness of a not very manly soul. These are carried about by every impure spirit, and are most vehemently driven to every kind of impurity, and they devote the highest zeal to vicious things. Moreover, notable are the wings, which are also said to be of a stork: but that is a kind of little bird, which always flies around foul-smelling mud, and seeks food from filth and dirt. Therefore, whoever spend their zeal on impurity, these without doubt are to be said to have the wings of a stork by most just right. They are also in the form of women and effeminate: they are of the same form in which their mistress iniquity is said to be. For as those who are under Him and with Him are conformed to Christ through sanctification: so those who have taken up the burden of iniquity, and have determined to pass their life with the impurity of vices, are conformed and similar to iniquity. That they carry the measure into the Babylonian region, and seek a house for it there: which thing, unless I am mistaken, signifies figuratively that those who reject the good things which have been obtained for us through Christ, and have loved the obstruction which is from sin, in that they have all their zeal placed in impurity, will be cast out from the holy city Jerusalem, that is, from that holy mother of the firstborn, and the heavenly and most beautiful city, and pressed by the weight of sin, almost unbearable, will dwell with the Babylonians, that is, will have part and lot with the impious worshippers of idols. For those who despise the redemption of Christ do not differ from the impious. Therefore the Savior says, "If your brother sins, go, rebuke him between you and him alone; if he listens to you, you have gained your brother; but if he does not listen, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. But if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the Church; but if he refuses to listen even to the Church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector."<sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup> It is therefore not at all obscure, and indeed confirmed by the testimony of the whole divine Scripture, that all justification and redemption is in Christ.</p>
