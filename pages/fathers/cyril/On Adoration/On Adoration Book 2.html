    <h1>On Adoration in Spirit and Truth, Book II</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">Of St. Cyril, Archbishop of Alexandria</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">That death followed upon sin, and that the tyranny of the devil cannot be avoided except through the sanctification which is from Christ; and that justification is not in the law, but in Christ.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The matter, therefore, Palladius, namely, to desire to be separated from that which is naturally harmful, and to strive for servitude under God, as a glorious and beneficial thing, our discourse has shown to be noble.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Certainly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And have we sufficiently confirmed that in every way we ought to depart from base things and seek what is honorable?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very much so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And finally, did it seem necessary to us, having left the love of pleasure in this worldly life and the tumult with which we are distracted for its sake, to hasten to offer sacrifice to God as far away as possible, and with a mind as if we were in a desert, to practice a service that is leisured, most pure, untouched by pollution, and indeed excellent and acceptable to Him?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Moreover, that Satan, having constrained us under his power and, having usurped dominion, wished to keep us confined by his deceit, the divine law called us to the dignity of liberty; and this it effected by opposing the exhortations by which it urged us to the best actions to his impurities, and by instructing us towards a better way of life, as has been made clear by very many examples.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Absolutely.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> God, therefore, is the provider of salvation and the author of all prosperity for us, showing the way to familiarity with Himself, with Christ mediating. For would not the mediation through Moses be a type, and a very clear one, of the mediation through Christ?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> In what way?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For the divine Moses led Israel out from carnal servitude and removed them from the labors of brickmaking and from works in the earth; and as if placed as a mediator between God and men, he conveyed the words from above to them. But our Lord Jesus Christ, transferring what was in type and shadow into truth, draws us out from spiritual servitude, displacing sin which formerly tyrannized over us, and shaking off the power of the devil, and persuading those who think they must follow Him to depart from earthly-mindedness and from zeal for fleshly things, and reshaping them, as it were, into a disposition for virtue, and most clearly announcing to us the will of God the Father. Therefore He said: "The words that I speak are not mine, but of Him who sent Me."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> And again: "I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak."<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> And indeed Moses himself made himself an image and representation of the mediation in Christ, saying to the sons of Israel: "The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet from your brothers, like me. You shall listen to him in all things whatever you asked of the Lord your God in Horeb, in the day of the assembly."<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Therefore, the things through Moses and the power of his mediation were in type and image; but the manner of the mediation in Christ is more ineffable. For he was a minister of the law and shadow and a conveyor of the instruction from above; but Christ, as the master of the law and the prophets, decrees what is authoritative to Him, and was the mediator, with deity and humanity concurring and uniting, as it were, into one in Him. For we understand Christ as both together. "For Moses indeed was faithful as a servant in all his house, but Christ as a son over his own house, whose house we are"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>: we who have been led to true liberty through faith in Him. It is established, therefore, that Moses was the mediator of carnal liberty, and the letter and shadow, the interpreter of sacred things; but our Lord Jesus Christ is the introducer of things above the law, and bestows the liberty of the spirit, which is incomparably better than that carnal liberty.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You have spoken excellently.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Let us not, therefore, boast in any carnal distinctions, but in those in the spirit and in the righteousness that is from Christ, not that which is from the law. For if everyone who is under sin is a slave, and the law does not justify in any way, but rather condemns and makes transgressors guilty, to whom is it not clear that all justification consists in Christ? And likewise, that all spiritual perfection, which is through sanctification, is acquired through Him and in Him? Paul, a truly wise man, writes: "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith."<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> He also notes the weakness and infirmity of the old law with these words: "But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. And the law is not of faith: but, The man that does them shall live in them."<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> Therefore, we are justified in Christ through faith, and redeemed from spiritual servitude.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Is the law then useless?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> I do not say that, for it was not sanctified by divine oracles in vain; but indeed it was "given for a help,"<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> as it is written; for in that part which pertained to childish instruction and for the knowledge of iniquity, and also for perceiving the beginnings and elements of the words of God, why should it not be understood as useful? But it is weaker for washing away sins and perfecting holiness. Therefore, the blessed Paul says: "Now we know that what things soever the law says, it says to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin."<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> The law, therefore, has the power to demonstrate sin, not to procure the glory of virtue; for when it says, for example: "You shall not commit fornication, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> and anything similar to these, it shows kinds of wickedness and drives away impurities, but does not introduce the notion of virtue, nor does it produce a clear knowledge of the good life for its hearers. For indeed, that one ought not to engage in base actions is to be counted among the customs of a more excellent life; to think otherwise would be foolish, I believe. But I think, and not absurdly, that it is just that honorable judgment and approval be bestowed upon us in every kind of praiseworthy thing if, having dismissed and repelled vices, and overcome wickedness, and cast away impure crimes, we finally ascend to the highest peak of virtue. Therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ says: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> You understand, therefore, that a righteousness more excellent than that legal one is prescribed by our Lord, and knowing it to be the most excellent, Paul the wise writes: "Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith."<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I understand clearly, for you have used plain speech. However, I would like you to explain this: if the ancient law was not sufficient for perfecting man, why was not the righteousness through faith, and the sanctification which results from it, established from the beginning instead?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Because certainly, Palladius, that which is soiled is washed; that which is polluted is cleansed; that which has darkness poured over it is illuminated. But it is just, I think, according to the voice of our Savior, to care for what is infirm; and to call to repentance, not those who are sanctified, but those who are hateful on account of sins.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> Can it indeed be denied that it was necessary that those who were to be called to the grace of remission should first be condemned, so that when they had first come into the danger of perdition on account of the weakness that was in them, then at last they might be seen as redeemed? Wherefore it was necessary that the law, which has the power of showing sin, be promulgated as a kind of accuser and most diligent prosecutor of the weakness of all, so that we might not be ignorant of the magnitude of the divine goodness which is shown through Christ. For where or how would there be a place for granting grace, unless the crimes were first demonstrated and established? And, to use a brief discourse and return to the examples of the ancients, I will say again: God promised grace through faith to Abraham, and in that man, as in the firstfruits of those who obtained mercy, He made the remission which is bestowed by God's kindness more noble than the law itself. For it is written: "Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness."<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> But Paul proclaims and says: "How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised."<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> And he heard God saying plainly to him, "In you shall all nations be blessed."<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> Moreover, the force of these words "in you" is perhaps to signify "according to your likeness." And understanding it in this sense, Paul says: "And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In you shall all nations be blessed. So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham."<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> Therefore, the circumcision of that faith which was in uncircumcision is therefore from faith; and that he was justified not by the works of the law, and that the glory according to us is newer than the circumcision of the flesh, is clear, for he is called the friend of God.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I would therefore not absurdly question why that sanctification through faith was delayed so long; for on account of what cause is the sign itself placed in the older order, but the superior thing in the later?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For did we not say just now that it was the work of a certain admirable and sublime skill that the law, which condemns, should precede in the order of time the faith which justifies? Does not the light shine in the darkness?<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> And virtue is made perfect in weakness, as it is written?<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, the law entered that sin might abound. For where no law is, there is no transgression.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> But what pardon for transgression and the laziness that leads to it could be understood, unless the law had first condemned us? That what I say is true, and that the discourse concerning this is not vain or inept, Paul will confirm, saying: "Wherefore then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator."<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> Moreover, because he was most wise, he endeavored to anticipate the clever arguments and doubts of some men in the future; for it was likely that some would complain about the delay and postponement of the righteousness of faith, and say that the law was introduced in the meantime to make void the firmness of that ancient promise. Therefore he says: "Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. But the scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus."<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> And he makes the difficulty of the same doubt very clear by adding: "And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise."<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> The law, therefore, having shut us up under sin, schooled us unto Christ; for Christ is the end of the law and the prophets.<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> Therefore, He said to the people of the Jews who were disobedient to Him: "If you had believed Moses, you would have believed me: for he wrote of me."<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> We are justified, therefore, not by the works of the law, but rather by faith in Christ: "For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. But Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree: That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But, noble sir, let us proceed, if it seems good, to something else pertaining to the knowledge of Christ; for we have said enough about the law and its dispensation.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Speak, therefore, whatever you wish, my friend, provided it is not too far beyond my ability.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And indeed the question is not too difficult, or such that it cannot be approached with great effort, especially since Christ sheds His divine light upon us. Shall we then honor God with unbloody gifts, having received the justification through faith, and being urged on to the service in shadows and types?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You speak correctly. For it is written: "Honor the Lord with your righteous labors, and offer Him the firstfruits of your fruits of righteousness."<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup> "For with such sacrifices God is well pleased,"<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup> according to the voices of the saints.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is right, therefore, that we should pursue new things, having received the injunctions of the ancient commandment as an inheritance. For the slaughter of sheep and cattle, and incense, and fine flour mixed with oil, and turtledoves or pigeons, were the offerings of the worshippers at that time. But explain to me why God did not reject these from the beginning, but is seen to have legislated what pleases Him only now, and has revealed the modes of our spiritual sacrifices?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> What then do you think? Do you dare to say that God did not legislate correctly in the beginning, and having, as it were, missed the mark of the perfectly Good, only later with difficulty found the greater good? Or that He was content then with things as in shadows, as having what was sufficient for Him, but later, affected by a certain love of novelty in us, bestowed the honor on other things, and instituted for us a service not previously known?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Not at all; for that would be a fable, I think, and I would never suppose that God could err in any matter, however small. But I wish to learn for what reason He sanctioned those things for us who are on earth then, but now others.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Your speech compels me to repeat what was said above. Did I not say that the law was a pedagogue, that is, a teacher for those who were still infants and not yet able to understand what is truly good, and which also indicated through a riddle the perfect and well-pleasing will of God, and signified it, as it were, to still rather rude souls? For you can understand, and not with great difficulty, that the manner of spiritual service was always, even from the beginning, most pleasing to God; but the souls of the Jews were not yet able to penetrate and attain to it. Therefore, there was need of speech suited to infancy, and simple discipline and moderated education, which had nothing arduous, nothing harsh. For God indeed instituted from the beginning the things that were done in types; but He foretold that those things which pertain to the true worship of God would come and be present in their own time. Therefore, He rejected and repudiated that approach by which He was approached through the blood of sacrifices, speaking through the prophet Amos: "I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies. Though you offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts. Take you away from me the noise of your songs; for I will not hear the melody of your viols."<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> He also introduced through Micah the person of a man desiring to learn thoroughly in what way he might do good, which is altogether free from blame: "Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?"<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup> Then immediately he subjoins: "He has shown you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?"<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup> Is not this clearly what Christ says: "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me"?<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup> And again: "If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be."<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> The Christian religion is situated not in the legal service, but in the holy and spiritual one.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You have spoken most correctly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Moreover, rebuking the Israelites vehemently through Isaiah, he says: "Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah. To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? says the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats. When you come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to tread my courts? Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them."<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup> Furthermore, through the prophet Malachi he says the same to the most hateful men, and also mentions the times in which an incomparable and spiritual sacrifice would be offered to Him from all lands. For thus he speaks again: "I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, says the Lord of hosts."<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup> You understand, therefore, that incense and a pure sacrifice are to be offered to Him from every nation. Moreover, that in calling that recent testament in Christ "new," he antiquated the former and old one. For thus the blessed Paul writes.<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> Likewise, in this place, in saying that a pure sacrifice from every nation would be in its own times, he passed judgment on that old one, that it is not of such a kind. For how can that be pure which neither justifies nor can lead us to perfect virtue? Wherefore the blessed Paul says that the old one was not without fault; and therefore that which was sanctified through Christ necessarily succeeded it, and was sought in the second place.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Was that shadowy service, then, altogether apart from the will of Almighty God?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Entirely. And it is at hand to hear God speaking most plainly to the sons of Israel through the voice of Jeremiah: "Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh. For I spoke not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices: But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice."<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> For as far as pertains to the principal will of the Founder, it was not delivered by the divine oracles at the beginning in any way. That law, still situated in shadows, if one were to be silent about the spiritual service. But because the matter was weighty, and access to the perfect consummation of virtue was not easy for the men of that time to attain—indeed, in my opinion, it was hard and harsh—the written law was established with wise moderation as a kind of childish exercise, which had the form of truth. Moreover, that lawgiver signified to us not obscurely that those things were not very pleasing to Him, but rather that He desired those which were afterwards to be prescribed through Christ. Therefore, He said again: "Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and your judgments are as the light that goes forth. For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings."<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> To God, indeed, love towards brothers, by which the law is fulfilled, is more pleasing than a slain calf or sheep, and that eminent knowledge of Christ, through which the Father Himself is also known by us. And no one will doubt that eternal life is procured for us by this, Christ saying to the Father who is in heaven:<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup> "And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent." And how can the truth be gainsaid in any way?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Not at all.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But after Israel fell away from union with God; indeed, rejecting faith, it did not know God most openly; it is foretold by Isaiah that it would not be in any other way that they should return to that ancient dignity, except through Christ alone, with those legal institutions cast aside. Therefore, it is written: "For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim: Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord their God, and David their king; and shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter days."<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup> For when the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, then all Israel shall be saved;<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup> but in Christ, however, who is called David because He is from the seed and tribe of David. That the sacrifices themselves from the law are also to be taken away, He confirms through Joel, saying: "Gird yourselves, and lament, you priests: howl, you ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withheld from the house of your God."<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup> And again through the same prophet: "The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests, the Lord's ministers, mourn."<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup> Furthermore, He promised that the tabernacle itself would be taken from the midst, with these words: "And it shall come to pass, when you be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says the Lord, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the Lord: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more."<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup> The tabernacle being taken away, along with the typical and bloody sacrifice, it was necessary, so to speak, that it itself also be taken from the midst; since that truer one was to be raised up opposite to it, that is, the Church, concerning which Christ Himself says, "This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it."<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup> Moreover, that the service itself was to be changed and transferred into a better form, into that service, I say, which is exhibited in Christ and is new, will be made clear by those words which Malachi wrote concerning God: "And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years."<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup> You understand, therefore, how he says that a kind of new recasting and reformation of the priesthood and at the same time of the sacrifices was to come?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I understand.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For this word "purge" and "purify," spoken as of gold and a goldsmith, does it not lead us to this understanding?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very much so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Moreover, God the Father confirmed that the incarnate Word would effect something of this sort when He said: "And the Lord, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, says the Lord of hosts. But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver."<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup> He speaks, therefore, of a renewal and reformation of the priesthood to come, and this certainly indicates the form of service itself, nothing other than the present mystery of Christ. Again, through Ezekiel, He said concerning those who were chosen to perform the priesthood: "And the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, says the Lord God: They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge."<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> And shall we not rightly say that the fat and the blood, and those table ministries, are that mystery of Christ?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Moreover, He made the time when the restoration of all things to a better state and that mode of renewal would come, very clear to us, when God said: "And it shall be from the eighth day and onward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, says the Lord God."<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup> He calls the eighth day the time of our Savior's resurrection, on which burnt offerings, that is, the perfect and whole consecration of believers, are offered to God as most pleasing and spiritual gifts; and the blessed Paul teaches this when he writes: "By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name."<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup> And again: "But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup> For what other fruits can be offered to God by us who are justified by faith than His continual and perpetual glorification? And a most pure sacrifice is the excellent odor of a praiseworthy life.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> The discourse proceeds excellently, and it is most true that no one is justified by the law, but rather through faith in Christ and the evangelical discipline. I would like this exposition of yours to be seen to be confirmed by examples and made plain to me from the Sacred Scriptures.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> I come, therefore, to this part myself, Palladius, willingly, because it seems so to you. But I would like you in turn to seek a subtle and polished sense in each contemplation; and if I seem to you to think or speak less correctly, prudently correct and amend it openly, following the example of the most excellent craftsmen, who, if anywhere the work they have in hand has deviated from the rule of his art and design, he skillfully restores it and brings it back to the form which seems best to him. We will take the beginning of this discussion from Moses, the interpreter of the sacred rites; and when I have touched upon his history in a cursory manner, I will then strive to confirm and show clearly that the law brought nothing to perfection, and that it is not sufficient for salvation, and that Christ is the redeemer and savior of all men.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Know then that you will bring no small utility if you overcome hesitation in this part also; for although the things you undertake are most difficult, and the truth of the matters we inquire into may seem most difficult, yet God who reveals is rich.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You speak rightly; and your speech persuades me, like the most sagacious dogs, to track down the hidden and more obscure meanings. Therefore, in the desert of the province of Madian, while the blessed Moses was pasturing flocks of sheep at the very roots of Mount Horeb, a certain new thing, full of miracle, was shown by God: "For an angel appeared to him," it says, "in a flame of fire from a bush, and he saw that the bush was burning with fire, and was not consumed. And Moses said: I will go and see this great vision, why the bush is not consumed." Now the bush is not a cultivated tree, but a kind of wild, mountainous thorn and stem, in which that miracle full of awe was performed, which very aptly bore the figure of a mystery. For that angel was one who was being consumed on all sides in the appearance of fire, and yet impressed no trace of fire on that stem; and the tree received not even the smallest part of heat from the fire, just as if it were not present at all.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What then was that?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It was surely for Israel, as a wild tree having no fruits of sweet justice, which was being nourished in the laws of the Egyptians, that the law was to be given by the ministry of angels, which would indeed have the power of illuminating, if understood spiritually, and could drive away the darkness of the mind (for the nature of fire is such that it also produces that effect), but it was nevertheless useless to those receiving it, through no fault of its own, but because those with whom it was dealing did not at all admit that light into their soul and heart. For although they abounded externally with the letter, as with a certain appearance of light, what they thought they had, they truly did not have at all. Therefore, what was seen concerning the bush, that it seemed to be on fire yet did not bring harm to the tree, seems to signify something of this kind. Moreover, that the light from the law was useless to the Jews, the Savior Himself declares with these words: "You search the scriptures, because you think you have eternal life in them; and they are they which testify of me: and you will not come to me, that you may have life."<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup> And a little later, again rebuking the teachers of the Jews and the whole people.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">"Do not think," He says, "that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust. For if you had believed Moses, you would perhaps have believed me; for he wrote of me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup> For those who had most foolishly utterly rejected the rudiments of the law, by what reason could they receive the knowledge of perfect virtue, taught by Christ? When, therefore, the blessed Moses saw the bush indeed burning, but not at all consumed, and indeed not even yielding to the flames, he was astonished at what it was, that the bush was not consumed. For one may wonder at the supreme stupor of Israel, who, when they had received the law from God as a patron and helper, and had been enriched with its illumination, held such a great thing in no account, nor did they place this gift in the dwelling of their mind and heart; and so they perceived no utility from it: for it was dead among them; surely, and lifeless, that the bush is not consumed; otherwise the sense of Scripture would be with us, and they would not absurdly be said to be fervent in spirit with us.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very well said.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Moreover, this deed seems to show secretly an understanding of other meanings, not inept: for to the Israelites, when they were about to set out from the land of the Egyptians, and a little later to cast off the yoke of forced servitude, and because it would happen that they would stir up the anger of the prince in whose dominion they still were, God showed that which was happening in the bush as a portent, by which He signified that they would be far superior even to fire itself, and not to be overcome by those who could inflict injury, according to that, I think, which was said divinely: "Do not fear, for I am with you; the flame shall not burn you, the rivers shall not cover you."<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> An ingenious exposition.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And so Moses, astonished by this spectacle, runs nearer with eagerness to see: "And when the Lord saw," it says, "that he drew near to see, He called to him from the bush, saying: Moses, Moses. And he answered: What is it? And God said: Do not come near; take off your sandals from your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy ground."<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup> Moreover, the blessed Moses held the figure of the law: "For they have Moses and the prophets,"<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup> says that blessed Abraham in the evangelical oracles. Does this saying seem improbable to you?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Not at all; for Moses sustains the person of the law.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore Israel was called, and that flock which lived according to the law and was under the law. "For the Lord," it says, "the God of the Hebrews, has called us."<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup> And indeed they were obedient to God calling, as also Moses: "All things," they say, "whatever God has said, we will do and be obedient."<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup> But, because the legal obedience was not of such a kind as to be sufficient for purifying—"For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins"<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup>—therefore Moses is restrained from approaching God: "Do not come near," He says, "here."<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup> For by the powers of the law, excellent virtue cannot be approached; nor did that way of living from the law of Moses have that faculty which was sufficiently adequate to be able to lead men to God. For Christ offers us to Him through sanctification; for it is fitting that those who are to be joined to the holy God be holy; "You shall be holy," He says, "for I am holy."<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup> Moreover, that the form of living according to the law was not entirely free from fault, He taught when He said: "Take off your sandals from your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy ground."<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup> For He ordered Moses, that interpreter of the sacred institutions, to take off the sandal from his foot, showing that the walk of that life which was led by the law was not yet pure, nor wholly free from corruption and the quality of mortal works. And that in which the remnants of corruption and mortality are present, it is unlawful to withdraw to God; the divine Moses had learned this by custom. For they did not approach the temples with feet shod in sandals made from the skin of a dead animal; for that was counted among the kinds of uncleanness in their laws. But it is not the law, Palladius, not the footsteps congruent with the letter of the Mosaic law, that have freed us from mortality and corruption, and the other things which pertain to this impurity; but faith in Christ, and the most perfect regulation of the evangelical life. Do you think what I say is true?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Why not?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, with sandals removed, God addressed him now running and approaching nearer: "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses turned away his face," it says; "for he was afraid to look upon God."<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup> For having put off a lifeless sense, and walking the way of conversation with a world-free foot through Christ, we will approach God, not by spatial distance, but by spiritual affection; for the things done by Moses were figures and shadows. Then at last we shall gain the words of His doctrine, and we shall gather the knowledge of God in ourselves, the Father surely showing Himself to us in the Son; for we shall see Him, far more excellently than that ancient people, as they saw in the person of Moses; for he turned away his face; for he was afraid to look upon the Lord. By which deed is signified the infirmity of their mind, who were instituted under the discipline of the law, which in a certain way could not look upon God, nor gaze upon His glory, according to that which is sung in the Psalms: "Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see"<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup>; and that which is in the prophet: "Behold, a foolish and senseless people: they have eyes, and do not see."<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup> But we, who apply the pure and illuminated eyes of our mind to the reasons of that ineffable nature, contemplate that conspicuous form of God and the Father in the Son. And to the Jews indeed, who thought they had seen the Father, it was wisely said by Christ: "You have neither seen His form nor heard His voice."<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup> But to Philip asking, and indeed rather rudely than was fitting, but nevertheless asking with eagerness to learn and saying, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us,"<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup> Christ answered: "Have I been with you so long, and you have not known me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?"<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup> Moreover, that the contemplation and discipline of the legal mandate is not very firm, nor sufficiently apt for accurately perceiving God, as being in shadow and in a riddle, can be seen also in those two daughters of Laban. For it is written that this Laban had two daughters; the elder was named Leah, the younger Rachel. But Leah had weaker eyes, Rachel was of excellent form and truly beautiful appearance; and so the patriarch Jacob, although given to the love of Rachel, nevertheless married Leah before he was joined to the beautiful one. Therefore, if the figure is transferred to the antithesis, you will perceive the mystery of Christ. For two women are called to the spiritual marriage and joined to him; and the first, the elder, through Moses, who bore the person of the Synagogue of the Jews, to whom it was said by God through the voices of the prophets: "Behold, your eyes and your heart are not beautiful, except for avarice and for your iniquities, and for shedding blood."<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup> In the second place was married the younger and more beautiful one, the Church from the Gentiles, to whom David was saying: "Hear, daughter, and see, and incline your ear, and forget your people and your father's house, and the King will desire your beauty."<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup> It was said to her in a certain place, also that, "Your eyes are like doves."<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup> Moreover, that beauty of the Church is without doubt spiritual and truly heavenly. For it is written: "All the glory of the king's daughter is within."<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup> Now this word, 'within,' in the Hebrew language, signifies 'invincible'; for that beauty is not perceived by the eyes of the body, but is seen by the acumen of a pure mind. Is it not so?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very much so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, no one through the institution of the law perceives that divine and incorrupt beauty, but rather through Christ and His discipline.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is true.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Moreover, it was not Moses, nor the law, but the Lord of Moses, Christ, I say, and the power of His sacrament, that was powerful to redeem and deliver us from the hand and dominion of the devil. Certainly when God said: "I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows, and I have come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land, and to bring them into a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey"<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup>; and when He immediately added these words: "And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me; and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. Now therefore, come, I will send you to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that you may bring forth my people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt"<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup>; Moses openly and plainly cried out: "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?"<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup> Is it not then sufficiently evident that this is a figure? And does not this manner of refusal refer to Him who is superior and more excellent by infinite degrees, that is, to Christ? Otherwise, to say this very thing: "Who am I?" would be truly absurd. But it would have been very easy to snatch the peoples and procure salvation for the nations, and to call them back to liberty, if the powers of him who held them confined in servitude, Satan, I say, had been worn down and enervated.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Surely most easy; for you speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> What? Is it not then also entirely easy to see from this that the author of salvation for all men was the only-begotten Son of God? For by His help we have been redeemed, and, as the prophet says: "Not a legate, nor an angel, but the Lord Himself saved us."<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> From where? I ask...</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For the God of all things commanded Moses in express words to go without delay to the children of Israel and to tell them plainly that they had God, who can do all things, as a helper and patron, who would easily relieve the annoyance of Egyptian servitude; that they would return again to their own home; and when they had returned to the liberty of their fathers, that they would inhabit a holy land; and there they would most abundantly enjoy the resources and goods which He Himself would supply. But Moses answered, it says, and said: "If they will not believe me, nor listen to my voice; for they will say, God did not appear to you; what shall I say to them?" And the Lord said: "What is that in your hand?" And he said, "A rod." And He said: "Cast it on the ground." And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from it. And the Lord said to Moses: "Stretch out your hand, and take it by the tail." Stretching out his hand he seized the tail, and it became a rod in his hand."<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> An unusual indeed, and new miracle, Cyril; but what it wishes to signify, discuss, if you please, from the beginning.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> I will indeed discuss it. Since the Israelites had lived among the Egyptians for many ages, and there was no kind of sin into which they had not fallen, and since they were given over to the pleasures proper to that region, Moses was not ignorant that they had become more sluggish for that reason, and of such a kind that they could hardly be led to composed morals; but he thought it would be wise if the labor of works compelled them to obedience even if unwilling, if they should see him performing certain admirable works; for pleasure is a deeply fixed evil, and the wildness of our vices is difficult to tame; but if sweat subdues and labors are imposed, then he who is promised that he will be freed from those inconveniences will be easily persuaded to despise even the highest pleasures. Moreover, I think that God, who holds the knowledge of all honorable things, by most wise counsel imposed the troublesome and unbearable cruelty of the Egyptian men on the Israelites at that most powerful time: so that they might be ready to flee, and not, allured by the custom of pleasures, become stubborn and very difficult, and despising the grace of Him who called to liberty, they might willingly and freely embrace the servitude of Egypt, since they would prefer the delight of the present time to small labors sometimes, nay even to the very benefits of God. And so, although they had now most willingly emerged from that iniquity of the old masters, and were staying in the desert under the leadership of God, and were feeding on the food given from heaven and the skies, that manna, I say, which was supplied abundantly, yet they remembered that pleasure in Egypt not without tears, indeed complaining that it would have been much better for them if they had died then, when they were luxuriating in the pots of Egypt. And so with the greatest contention, like children, they cried out: "Would that we had died struck by the Lord in Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and ate bread to the full!"</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Moses was not therefore ignorant that the performance of miracles would be necessary, by which their minds might be brought to more easily obey: and so he says: "If they will not listen to me; for they will say: God did not appear to you; what shall I say to them?" But the God of all things ordered him to perform that miracle as a kind of exercise, for this reason, unless I am mistaken, so that He might first prove by the very experiment to His worshipper, that for himself, as for all others, that deed would have enough evidence to show most certainly that he had been called by God; for it does not pertain to any other than to the one Maker of all things to be able to change the nature of a thing into any other He wishes. At the same time He also willed that admirable thing to be a figure of that salvation which was to be bestowed upon us through Christ: for in it we will perceive how a certain reformation of human nature was made into its ancient state, and a transfiguration, as it were, into that condition in which we were in Adam, with the highest and not yet lost holiness.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> In what way? For you have used a rather obscure reasoning.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Was not his rod, Palladius, or scepter, an insignia of royalty?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very much so; for they say that some of the ancients were accustomed to swear by it, those who were eager to extol the deeds of the Greeks with praises.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> What then? Do you admit that the plant of paradise was such, which, before it was eaten, sprouted in the gardens?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I admit it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Go on now, and bring your mind back to that old Adam, and in him as in the beginning and root of our race, consider the universal nature of men: besides, think also that he was made in the image of the Creator and perfect, so that he might rule over earthly things, and was in the hands of God for that very reason, that he lived in holiness and was a most flourishing and also most noble shoot of paradise. But when, deceived by the bile of the serpent, he was led away from the ancient state, and was caught as a despiser of the divine command, then indeed, torn from his former seat and root, he fell from the hand of Him in whose holiness he was held, and fell to the earth, that is, he fell from that sublimity of virtue, and crawled so far, weak and languishing, that he willed to savor carnal things, and now labored with the highest wickedness, and in my judgment differed nothing from the serpent. Thus despoiled of the kingdom and that glory which he had held from the beginning, he was also cast out of paradise and its delights. Did not the blessed Moses tell us this?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> He indeed told it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Now the lawgiver, when he saw him brought to that wickedness, in a way fled, and detested the vice which was in him; for Moses fled from the serpent when it was cast down. And we read it written: "The Holy Spirit of wisdom will flee deceit, and will withdraw itself from thoughts that are without understanding."<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup> For sanctification and uncleanness, light and darkness, justice and injustice, can never agree together.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, what fell from the hand of Moses, the rod, perhaps signifies that man made in the image of God, was from the beginning a plant of paradise, and placed in that glory of the kingdom and in the hand of God; and that the same one fell to the earth, because he preferred to savor carnal things, and because of his highest bitterness, he was like a serpent in the eyes of the Divinity itself. But it was commanded to Moses to stretch out his hand and seize its tail; which when he did, it was immediately changed into its former form, so that it was no longer a serpent, but a rod again, and a shoot of paradise. When therefore it pleased God the Father to restore all things in Christ, and to reform that which had been made into its former state, He sent to us from heaven the Only-begotten, that right hand, I say, of His, that maker of all things and truly salutary, according to that: "The right hand of the Lord has wrought strength, the right hand of the Lord has exalted me."<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup> Now therefore, now, I say, He apprehended the prostrate nature of man; and when He had stripped us of the feral wickedness and poison of sins, through sanctification He brought us back to that royal honor and to the gentleness of virtue; and He restored that old dwelling to those believing in Him, to that thief who was as the firstfruit and prince of them, and was crucified with Him. "Amen, amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise."<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> This discussion has been conducted by us very well and most correctly. I would like you to explain to me, however, what was the reason that He ordered the tail to be seized rather than the head, or the middle part of the body.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For thus, Palladius, it was fitting to be done; for this very thing, to seize the tail, not the middle or the head, was consistent with the mystery.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How then?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Because the head is like a certain principle of the whole animal, as the tail is the end. Come therefore, let us consider the whole human race as one animal thus far: Christ therefore seized the tail, that is, the extreme and last parts; for He came at the extreme end of the ages. But, as Moses, although he had seized the tail, yet that reformation recurred right up to the very head (for that whole serpent was changed into a rod), in the same manner, although Christ seized the last, yet that reformation through grace extends to the whole race, and reaches right to the head itself, that is, Adam. For it is written that Christ died and lived again, that He might have dominion over the living and the dead<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup>: therefore in the extremes the redemption of the very principles is also perfected.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> A truly probable speech, and the narrative is not alien from what we proposed.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Moreover, to believe that, He confirmed him especially by two other signs of divine power. For it is written next: "And the Lord said to him further: Put your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom. And He said: Draw your hand out of your bosom. And he drew it out of his bosom, and his hand was leprous, as white as snow. And He said again: Put your hand into your bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom, and drew his hand out of his bosom, and it was restored again to the color of his flesh."<sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup> See therefore how this deed is fitting to God, and how worthy of admiration, and together with that miracle which we narrated just now, contains in a certain way the signification of the mystery of Christ.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Explain that then; for I understand nothing of it yet.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Leprosy is a disease of the flesh, and it is more serious than that it can be succored by doctors, or be overcome by their use and skill. It is utterly foul and impure, from that old law of Moses, and also most hateful to those who value highly the customs of the Gentiles; for he who labors with that disease is in a way half-dead: but a dead corpse is abominable and impure. Therefore, to be able to cure a leper, as an exceptional thing and far surpassing the mode of our powers, is attributed to the divine nature alone and its efficacy. And therefore Christ was held in admiration, who with authority cried out to the leper: "I will; be clean."<sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup> For that voice, the maker of all things, by which He even raises the dead from the sepulchres, superior to death and corruption, perfected this miracle in that man. He ordered, therefore, that he put his hand into his bosom, then, drawn out from the hiding of the bosom, he showed it all infected with leprosy; but when he had put it again into the bosom, He immediately brought it forth free from the force of the disease; so that from this thing the Israelites might understand that He would be their protector with a certain ineffable and almost unutterable power, who would be violated by injury and subject to the unjust dominion of the Egyptians. And this reasoning, although it is at hand, is nevertheless suitable to the history. But I think it will not be off the mark if we search out the meaning of the proposed place more subtly, and inquire what it is that he put his hand into his bosom, what also, that when it was drawn out, it was sprinkled heavily with leprosy: then we ought to investigate the manner of purification; for when he put his hand into his bosom, He rendered it free from that disease.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly. For it will help us not a little to search out these things one by one.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, in my opinion, this so admirable thing seems to signify something of this kind, as in a shadow. For as long as man, created in the image of God, was nourished as it were in the bosom of God, and had not yet trampled on the command delivered to him by God, protected by the providence and love of God towards him, he remained pure and holy and ignorant of death: but when he departed from the protection and friendship of God, because he had chosen to be more prone to base things, then indeed he was manifestly caught profane and execrable, and laboring with the impurity of death. But when God the Father Himself had again taken us up in Christ, and had surrounded us with the protection of divine grace, and contained us as in His bosom through the gift of adoption, immediately, with the impurities and mortality of that old curse cast away, we returned to that ancient condition in which we were at the beginning. For it is written concerning the hand of Moses: "It was restored to the color of his flesh."<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Most elegantly said.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Now that third sign in that matter most manifestly and most openly declares the mystery of Christ almost by voice: for thus God again addressed Moses: "But if they will not believe you, nor listen to the voice of the first sign, they will believe you by the voice of the following sign."<sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup> And what that is, He declares, saying: "And it shall be, if they will not believe these two signs, nor listen to your voice, you shall take water from the river and pour it upon the dry land, and the water which you take from the river shall become blood upon the dry land."<sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup> For the last sign in the world was the death of Christ, and that washing through water and blood, joined indeed also with the holy body, which is signified by the dry land; that water and blood flowed out from that most holy side pierced by a lance, it is not necessary to say, since it is most known to all. Moreover, that the death of our Savior was called a sign, anyone can also openly understand from the Sacred Writings; for those most audacious Pharisees, although many miracles had been performed before, yet as if no effect had yet been made, attacked Christ with these words: "Master," they say, "we wish to see a sign from you." But He in turn: "An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet. For as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights."<sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup> Therefore the first help was provided for us in Christ through the law of Moses: "For He gave the law for a help,"<sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup> according to the voice of the prophet. But Moses seized the tail. The second washing, again in Christ, was given through the holy prophets, and through the voice and mission of John. For they were saying: "Wash yourselves, be clean"<sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup>; but he was calling to the baptism of repentance. The third sign, which He says is the same last one, was the death of Christ; which being given, faith followed: "For if they will not believe you," He says, "nor listen to the voice of the first sign, they will believe the voice of the following sign."<sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup> You see how He says that faith will follow openly not when the first sign is given, that is, not immediately after the help of the law, nor after the middle washing, that is, that with which the holy prophets and John washed; but only after the voice of the last sign: for the sacrament of Christ itself is not without voice<sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup>; nay rather, it calls all through the whole world, with a certain high and vehement preaching, to the washing of water and blood, and indeed also to the vivification which the participation of His holy flesh bestows. The law therefore, by prophesying Christ, exhibited a ministry; yet in it there is not enough protection to be granted to some for salvation; and that Moses confesses this openly, anyone can easily show also from the proposed passage of Scripture: for although God had said that He would be with him, and persuaded him of this by the miracles performed before, yet he was asking, saying: "Lord, I am not fit from yesterday, nor from the day before, nor from the time you have spoken to your servant: I am of a weak voice and a slow tongue." And the Lord said, it says, to him: "Who gave a mouth to man, and who made the mute and the deaf, the seeing and the blind? Is it not I the Lord God? And now go, and I will open your mouth and instruct you what you ought to say." And Moses said: "I beseech you, Lord, send by the hand of him whom you will send." I beseech you, O Lord, choose another powerful one whom you will send. For the law is not altogether powerful, nor is it strong enough to preserve the whole world, and to free man from the dominion of the devil. Nor indeed was Moses ignorant that he was slow of speech and of a weak voice, especially from that time when God began to speak with him, and commanded him to have a discourse about Himself; and said: "Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: I AM WHO I AM: this is my name."<sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup> For the law speaks with a tongue too slow to express sufficiently concerning Him who is; nor is it of such a kind that it can unfold and deliver the mysteries of that venerable and ineffable nature, which is adored and worshipped in the holy Trinity. Moreover, it has a weak and feeble voice, so that it can scarcely converse with the Israelites alone, and is heard only within the borders of Judea, while all other nations have not even received the sound of its preaching with their ears. When therefore the blessed Moses foresaw that He who could best pour forth a well-expressed and polished discourse about God into the ears of the hearers, and easily preach to the whole world, that is, Christ, he said, "I beseech you, O Lord, choose a powerful one, whom you will send."<sup><a href="#fn92" id="ref92">92</a></sup> For Christ is that truly powerful one, who in His own times, by the good pleasure of God the Father, was to be chosen for this matter, and was also proclaimed through the law. Moreover, that refusal of Moses, after the promise of God and the showing of many signs, might not unreasonably be a figure of Israel delaying, and at the same time refusing to perform and obey the divine and evangelical ministries under the command of Christ, who after innumerable discourses held concerning faith, and the showing of many signs, nevertheless obstinately held to that heavy and slow hearing, and remained unbelieving.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">And indeed Moses refused twice: for two times occurred in which Israel was stubborn and contumacious, under Moses and Joshua, and the Judges, and subsequently in the time when there were prophets, and John, who was placed as it were in the interval between the apostles and the prophets; for he was the end of the prophetic order, and the same was the beginning and as it were the first-fruits of the apostolic splendor. But the refusal of Moses provoked God to anger, and finally the matter was transferred to another dispensation, by which they were to be saved, who were oppressed by the iniquity of the Egyptians. "And the Lord was angry with Moses, and said: Is not Aaron the Levite your brother? I know that he will speak for you: and behold, he will come out to meet you, and seeing you, he will be glad in himself: and you shall speak to him, and put my words in his mouth; and I will open your mouth, and his mouth, and I will instruct you what you shall do; and he shall speak to the people, and he shall be your mouth, but you shall be to him in those things which pertain to God."<sup><a href="#fn93" id="ref93">93</a></sup> For when the law had given offense, as being weak, and the Israelites were unwilling to obey it; Christ was added, that true Levite, and great prince of priests, He who, according to the prophetic form, is the Lord: "For I will raise up a prophet for them from among their brothers, and I will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak to them according to all that I shall command him."<sup><a href="#fn94" id="ref94">94</a></sup> And Christ Himself also said: "I do not speak from myself; but the Father who sent me, He gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak."<sup><a href="#fn95" id="ref95">95</a></sup> Christ addressed the people, and Moses indeed becomes a mouth, interpreting the law for us spiritually, but Moses again to Him in those things which pertain to God. For Moses seems to be somewhat closer to God, since Emmanuel was made under the law,<sup><a href="#fn96" id="ref96">96</a></sup> and promised to observe the things decreed through the most wise Moses; "Do not think that I have come to destroy the law, or the prophets; I have not come to destroy, but to fulfill."<sup><a href="#fn97" id="ref97">97</a></sup> Therefore Christ is a clear mystagogue, transferring the things of the slow-tongued law to greater clarity, and as it were reshaping the feeble sound of the letter into a most harmonious explanation. For the law is spiritual in Christ, and its proclamations are akin to the ancient ones; for Aaron was the brother of Moses.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore the law itself is weak by itself: for it has perfected nothing.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> So, I say; and one may contemplate the obscurity and lowliness of the way of life according to it through the following things. For it is written, that "Moses went, and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him: I will go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt; and I will see if they are still alive. And Jethro said to Moses: Go in health. And after those many days, the king of Egypt died; and the Lord said to Moses in Midian: Go, depart into Egypt; for all who sought your life are dead."<sup><a href="#fn98" id="ref98">98</a></sup> And Moses, taking his wife and children, set them upon beasts of burden, and returned into Egypt.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And what is the point of these things? For I do not understand, and cannot explain, on what grounds one could rightly blame the way of life according to the law.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And yet, Palladius, anyone might see that the matter is full of very many grounds for accusation, if he examines the meaning of the proposed words more sharply: for the divine Moses, having been chosen for this mission, does not proceed directly to it, having cast aside worldly things; but he is distracted even into carnal cares, and first communicates with his relatives about his journey. And he did not depart from the region of the Midianites until he learned that the tyrant of the Egyptians had died; for he greatly feared to be killed. But when he was freed from these fears by God announcing it to him, then at last, taking his wife and children, he descends into Egypt, fulfilling the things commanded. And these things would be a type of the life according to the law, which is in a certain way divided, and looks to both parts, to divine things, I say, and human; for it is not free from earthly and worldly cares, nor is it wholly sacred on every side. But the evangelical conversation is in no way divided in that which is of the flesh, nor does it involve itself in the business of worldly affairs; but rather it consecrates and dedicates wholly to God those who are under the rule of Christ: "For those who are of Jesus Christ," he says, "have crucified their flesh, with its vices and concupiscences."<sup><a href="#fn99" id="ref99">99</a></sup> And so a certain disciple, when he came and said to Christ: "Master, permit me first to go and bury my father,"<sup><a href="#fn100" id="ref100">100</a></sup> having learned that the way of life is wholly sacred, immediately heard: "Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead."<sup><a href="#fn101" id="ref101">101</a></sup> For also the admirable man Paul writes to certain ones: "When it pleased God to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not consult with flesh and blood."<sup><a href="#fn102" id="ref102">102</a></sup> But Moses consults with them; for that way of life from the law is divided, as I said, and is also subject to the fear of death. For Moses feared to descend into Egypt, fleeing the danger of death. But that fear is abolished in Christ. And the same Paul confirms this, speaking both of Christ and also of us, "Because indeed children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver those who through fear of death were subject to bondage all their life."<sup><a href="#fn103" id="ref103">103</a></sup> And so the soul of holy men boldly rises up even against death itself. For Paul says again: "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."<sup><a href="#fn104" id="ref104">104</a></sup> And again: "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?"<sup><a href="#fn105" id="ref105">105</a></sup> But that the life which is led according to the rule of the law is held by the fear of death; and on the contrary, that this conversation, full of glory in Christ, has avoided the snares of death, this also is made plain from that which sacred Scripture proclaims, that death reigned from Adam until Moses.<sup><a href="#fn106" id="ref106">106</a></sup> But who else destroyed death, or cast down the power of corruption, and saved not only the unbelievers, but also those who had been instructed under the discipline of the law, except our Lord Jesus Christ alone...? "For not a legate, nor an angel, but the Lord Himself saved them,"<sup><a href="#fn107" id="ref107">107</a></sup> was predicted by the prophetic response. Moreover, you can perceive, and not obscurely, the mystery of this thing as in a figure in those things which happened to the blessed Moses: for when he was setting out from the borders of the Midianites, and hastening into Egypt, God said to him: "When you enter and return into Egypt, see all the wonders which I have given in your hands, you shall do them before Pharaoh."<sup><a href="#fn108" id="ref108">108</a></sup> And after some things are interposed: "And it happened," it says, "on the way, at the inn, the angel of the Lord met him, and sought to kill him; but when Sepphora had taken a sharp stone, she circumcised the foreskin of her son, and fell at his feet, and said: The blood of the circumcision of my son has stood: and he departed from him, because she said: The blood of the circumcision of my son has stood."<sup><a href="#fn109" id="ref109">109</a></sup> Do you therefore need a longer discourse for clarity? Or is the contemplation proposed clear?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Not at all; for I do not understand at all what that is which is shown as in a shadow by this event.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do you not, Palladius, affirm it to be true, that human nature became subject to death from that ancient curse? For it was said to us, as to Adam himself, the first-fruit and highest root of the race: "You are dust, and to dust you shall return."<sup><a href="#fn110" id="ref110">110</a></sup></p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very much so.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, since it happened that the beginning of our race was subject to death, which arose from sin, necessarily the matter passed over into us ourselves, and together with the root the shoots springing from it were also allotted corruption. For the fruit of a corruptible body is corruptible. Thus death has reigned over all, even until Moses himself, that is, until the times under the law.<sup><a href="#fn111" id="ref111">111</a></sup> Therefore, a clear and evident type of death having power until Moses, and human things being subject to corruption, was that attempt of the angel against Moses at that time. However, Sepphora, his wife and companion, restrained the destroyer, and turned him away from Moses, circumcising her own child with a stone, and supplicating and saying: "The blood of the circumcision of my child has stood."<sup><a href="#fn112" id="ref112">112</a></sup> Now she said "the blood has stood," not as if the flow of blood had ceased; for that, I think, would never have turned the destroyer from his will to kill, but she said as it were: That which seemed good to God is done and fulfilled; that is, the circumcision of my child; as if someone might say, for example: The type of this matter has stood; or certainly: The reason for this matter has stood, for example. Instead of, It has come to an end and is demonstrated.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But what can we understand Sepphora to signify? What also the stone, and the circumcision made by it? How was the divine angel restrained, and how did Moses escape the death threatening and owed to him, when the child was circumcised?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The passage is obscure, and the meaning of the things sought is truly difficult to reach; but trusting in God, I will speak again as I am able. Sepphora, being the daughter of the priest of Midian (this man was of another race, and not of the blood of Israel), holds for us the type and person of the Church from the Gentiles, called to God from worldly worship. For it was said to her through the voice of David: "Hear, daughter, and see, and incline your ear, and forget your people and your father's house; for the King has desired your beauty: for He is your Lord."<sup><a href="#fn113" id="ref113">113</a></sup> Therefore she is called, as it were following the law, and joined in marriage with Moses the pedagogue, who leads rightly to the mystery of Christ. For the law is an elementary teacher, and leads to the beginnings of the words of God, and through enigmas and shadows of the knowledge of Him, it sows as it were seeds in us of the knowledge of the mystery concerning Christ. And so Christ said to the Jews, who had rejected even Moses himself, the most holy: "Do you think that I will accuse you to the Father? There is one who accuses you, Moses, in whom you hope. For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me."<sup><a href="#fn114" id="ref114">114</a></sup> Therefore, since Sepphora is accepted by us in the place of the Church from the Gentiles, without doubt the son from her will hold the figure of the newer people; since those who have believed have received that childhood in Christ through the Spirit, and regeneration unto God, whom David also calls in a certain place "a people that shall be created."<sup><a href="#fn115" id="ref115">115</a></sup> Therefore the newborn child in Christ, that is, the new and through faith people, by the circumcision in the Spirit restrains death. For the stone is a symbol of that unyielding nature, whose strength and solidity is signified by the stone, as being very hard. And so Joshua the son of Nun, when he had led the Israelite forces across the Jordan, circumcised them with stone knives,<sup><a href="#fn116" id="ref116">116</a></sup> plainly prefiguring that circumcision in Christ through the Spirit. For Christ is the rock, whom, as in a type, as I said just now, that stone also signifies, by which the son of Sepphora was circumcised. At that time also death fled, and departed from Moses he who sought to kill him, because he honored the mystery of His circumcision in Christ; in which the thing itself done seems to cry out to us figuratively, that not only from those who have been deemed worthy of the circumcision in Christ has death departed, but also that the thing itself, I mean the mystery of Christ, has been a help to the fathers. For as we all died in Adam, so also the grace through Christ is borne and poured out upon all.<sup><a href="#fn117" id="ref117">117</a></sup> For He died for this reason, that He might have dominion over both the dead and the living.<sup><a href="#fn118" id="ref118">118</a></sup> Therefore, at the time of the circumcision of the new people, the life of the fathers is also simultaneously perfected. For they live to God, since they are about to live; for this also the sacred word has declared to us.<sup><a href="#fn119" id="ref119">119</a></sup> Moreover, the time of the circumcision understood in the Spirit is the advent of Christ, who, although older than Moses, as God; yet is later than he, from the fact that He appeared as a man for the ministry undertaken for our sake. For I wish you to observe, that God appointed Moses first, then joined Aaron to him, prefiguring that the manifestation of Christ was later in time than the mission and ministry of Moses; who was equal to Moses on account of His humanity, but in divine and incomparable excellence He excelled because He was begotten from God the Father.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Moreover, you can also see this from the sacred Scriptures themselves, if you wish. "For Moses and Aaron did," it says, "as the Lord commanded them, so they did. And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron his brother was eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh."<sup><a href="#fn120" id="ref120">120</a></sup> Do you hear how, from the fact that they had reached the eightieth year, they were both equal, but Aaron exceeds by the number three? Therefore he is older than Moses, even if later in ministry. So Christ is equal in a certain part to Moses through His humanity, and later in the dispensation; but yet He is far preferred and set before him in what pertains to the Deity and the glory of the holy Trinity.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> A clear and perspicuous exposition indeed.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> What? Is not that also worthy of notice?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What is that?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For the Israelites would not have departed from the land of the Egyptians, nor shaken off from themselves that burdensome and hateful servitude, nay more, they would not have escaped the death inflicted on the firstborn of the Egyptians, and that unavoidable hand of the destroyer, unless they had first sacrificed the lamb in the figure of Christ, who takes away the sins of the world.<sup><a href="#fn121" id="ref121">121</a></sup> Therefore they anointed the doorposts with blood, as the law sanctioned by Moses commanded, but they fortified their souls with the mystery of Christ as with a shield and rampart. For the death of Christ is a medicine powerful to loose death, and those who are partakers of the mystical blessing are victors over death and destruction, as those words testify: "Amen, amen I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in you. But whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life."<sup><a href="#fn122" id="ref122">122</a></sup> Moreover, eating the lamb, they used unleavened bread with that food; which figure signified through the unleavened and pure food the elegance of the evangelical disciplines; but yet so that it prefigured that it would not be without sweat and the bitterness of pressures: for eating bitter herbs together with unleavened bread secretly signifies that most sincere and pure life in Christ cannot be led without bitterness. Therefore to the unleavened foods bitterness also is necessarily joined: "For all who want to live piously in Christ will suffer persecution,"<sup><a href="#fn123" id="ref123">123</a></sup> he says. But yet, whoever have suffered this are blessed: for by suffering together, they will also attain to reign together, as it is written.<sup><a href="#fn124" id="ref124">124</a></sup> Does the discourse therefore seem to you to have deviated from what is fitting?</p>
