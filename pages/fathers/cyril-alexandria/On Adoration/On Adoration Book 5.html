    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">On courage in Christ</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, holy men, even if they strive for the life of others, have this principle, Palladius, that they wish to set their mind on no thing which is in this world; for thus they will be wise and powerful, and full of the best hope, and fortified by heavenly benevolence. And indeed you know that things cannot be otherwise. For if they have a mind elevated above worldly distractions and temporal desires, they will plainly meet unwarlike enemies, and will overcome their adversaries with very little trouble, God overthrowing their strength; but if they themselves are also captured by worldly affections and entangled in earthly desires, they will easily lie open to the incursions of persecutors, and will be overcome with no trouble, and being manifestly stripped of divine protection, they will be like prepared prey set before the enemies of their purpose.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But I plainly desire to know from where what you have said can be proven.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> From the Holy Scriptures, which usefully preach the things that happened to ancient men; for does not the blessed Paul also say that those things were written for our admonition?<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I confess it; for the narratives which are brought forth from those Scriptures bring us no small utility. For they were shadows and figures of the truth.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Now therefore let us begin to speak. When the Israelites had crossed the Jordan, they invaded the region of Jericho, and obeying the divine commands, they were intent on besieging it, as if they would very quickly capture and take it. Therefore, soldiers most fit for fighting were present, instructed according to the laws of war. For it is written: "Joshua the son of Nun went to the priests and spoke to them, saying: Command the people to go around and surround the city, and let the fighting men pass over armed before the Lord"<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>; i.e., for Christ commanding through the voice of the leader, we contend against enemies, and we undertake war not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, and against that law which dominates in the members of the flesh.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> We will also then be in the sight of the Lord, both equipped with a certain divine and spiritual armor; for our weapons are not carnal, as Paul says<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>; and then indeed distinguished by the glory of righteousness. Therefore, that God, the Lord of all things, looks upon the men most prepared for fighting, clothed with the shining arms of righteousness, and that is for the armed fighters to pass over in the sight of Christ. But it is especially honorable and surely desirable to be in the sight of God; if indeed it is not absurdly understood that God imposes this as a punishment on those who have offended Him, that He turns away from them, when He says: "When you stretch out your hands to me, I will turn my eyes away from you."<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> When, however, the siege had been led to the seventh day, Joshua the son of Nun again said to the sons of Israel: "Shout to the Lord; for the Lord has delivered the city to us; and the city shall be anathema, it and all things which are in it, to the Lord God of hosts Sabaoth. But save the prostitute Rahab herself, and all things which are in her house. But you beware of the anathema, lest perhaps you yourselves, thinking, take from the anathema, and make the camp of the sons of Israel anathema, and destroy us; and all the silver and gold, and bronze and iron shall be holy to the Lord: it shall be brought into the treasuries of God."<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> For He permitted the strong men to enjoy the rest of the plunder; but He said that all the silver and gold, and also the bronze and iron, ought to be brought into the treasuries of the Lord; for this was that which is called anathema, that is, what was given from all things, and segregated for God. However, no regard for the precept being had: "Achar," it says, "the son of Charmi, the son of Zambri, the son of Zara, from the tribe of Judah, took from the anathema: and the Lord was angry with wrath against the sons of Israel."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> For it is necessary, I think, that those who have opposed a firm mind in Christ to carnal pleasures and the distractions of this life, and have decided to obtain praise through the arms of righteousness, and who have now come into the sight of Christ, should seek nothing of those things which seem admirable in this world, not riches, not glory, not power, nor an eminent rank, nor impious dogmas from gentile wisdom. And indeed the figure of that splendor which is seen in high rank and amplitude would not ineptly be silver; for this kind of metal is splendid; but of riches, gold. Moreover, that sound of the tongue, which the wise of the world use, can signify...</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But I would like you to explain this to me, turning aside a little from the deed and history: why silver, and gold, and likewise bronze and iron are consecrated to God, and rather are not thrown out of the camp as perhaps useless, or as things of that kind which could pollute? For the faculty of spiritual contemplation has shown them to have been abominable.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Because all splendor, Palladius, and wisdom, and riches, and also strength are fittingly and justly attributed to God; for His is the glory, and all splendor, and riches, and wisdom, and power. But whoever has received from Him, and has been enriched from His treasury with riches, namely intellectual ones, and has had glory and wisdom and spiritual power, he indeed will be conspicuous and happy; but if he should prefer to receive these same things from the world, he will be execrable and hateful to God the lover of virtue, and liable to the judgment of punishment. For pleasure certainly follows riches; but pride is immediately near to splendor and amplitude; but iniquity is joined to power; and finally, the perversity of worldly dogma, although the tongue of those who wrote them sounds sweet. Something of this kind Paul says: "If anyone among you seems to be wise, let him become a fool, that he may be wise; for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God."<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> Therefore Achar, when he had taken these things not from the treasury of Christ, but as if from the world, from the very city of Jericho, offended God. But the things which followed from the wrath of God pertained not only to him who was condemned for that crime, but afflicted the whole synagogue; for that once invincible people of Israel, made without supernal protection, became weak and unwarlike.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But how or from where can we be taught that what you have said about this matter is true?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> From those things which are subsequently written. For after those things which were done excellently and bravely concerning the city of Jericho and against it, Joshua sent chosen men from the whole people of Israel from Jericho to the town of Ai, saying: "Go up and spy out Ai." And those men went up and spied out Ai, and returned to Joshua and said to him: "Let not all the people go up to it, but let about two or three thousand men go up and besiege the city; do not lead the whole people there, for they are few." And about three thousand men went up there, and fled from the face of the men of Ai, and the men of Ai killed about thirty-six men; and they pursued them from the gate, and broke them in the descent; and the heart of the people was afraid, and became as water.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> Those who had taken cities and laid waste regions and had conquered the most savage nations with no trouble, fell upon the men of Ai as if invincible, and scarcely guarded their safety, and did not depart without loss, who before had not even wished the whole number of fighters to be in arms, and who had openly professed that the city could be easily taken even by a few. "Let not the whole people go up at once," they say, "but about two thousand men." When Joshua was bearing this unexpected chance and unlooked-for calamity most grievously, and was tearing his garment, and falling before God, and wondering what this thing was, God said: "Rise; why have you thus fallen on your face? The people have sinned, and have transgressed my covenant, which I made with them, and have stolen from the anathema; they have even put it in their vessels. The sons of Israel will not be able to stand before the face of their enemies; they will turn the neck and back in the sight of their enemies, because they have become anathema; I will not add further to be with you, unless you remove the anathema from yourselves."<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> Therefore, when Achar had been indicated, Joshua questioned him, saying: "Give glory today to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession, and tell me what you have done, and do not hide it from me." And Achar answered Joshua and said: "Truly I have sinned before the Lord God of Israel; thus and thus I did. I saw among the spoils a variegated garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and one golden tongue of fifty shekels, and thinking about them I took them; and behold, these are hidden in the earth in my tent, and the silver is hidden under them."<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> You understand that he who had committed the theft is said to have seen among the spoils a variegated garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a golden tongue of fifty didrachms, and to have thought about them, that is, to have come to their nefarious desire. Therefore, some think the garment is a stole, and say it is a variegated cloak; but it is a military garment, and a symbol of iniquity. For it is innate to the military kind of men that they most willingly claim for themselves more than is just. Moreover, silver is the figure of worldly splendor; but the tongue is the sign of the sweet-speaking wisdom of the gentiles. Such is the tongue and learning among the wise of the gentiles, as if golden, and especially precious, as pertains to the clarity of diction. The sin now having been detected, Joshua condemned Achar to punishment, because he had brought destruction not only on himself, who was the author of the crime, but on the whole Synagogue, proceeding from his impotent desire. And this is perhaps that which is most excellently and most wisely said to us by the voice of Paul: "Remove the evil from among yourselves: a little leaven corrupts the whole lump."<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly. For I agree with you. But I would like you to explain that to me, turning aside a little from the deed and history: why silver, and gold, and likewise bronze and iron are consecrated to God, and rather are not thrown out of the camp as perhaps useless, or as things of that kind which could pollute?

And Achar answered Joshua and said: "Truly I have sinned before the Lord God of Israel; thus and thus I did.

Therefore, some think the garment is a stole, and say it is a variegated cloak; but it is a military garment, and a symbol of iniquity.

And this is perhaps that which is most excellently and most wisely said to us by the voice of Paul: "Remove the evil from among yourselves: a little leaven corrupts the whole lump."<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, is it not clearly demonstrated to you, first indeed in Abraham, that that glory from fortitude is of no hindrance to holy men, and it easily follows from it that they can overcome enemies, if they wish to seek nothing worldly; then in Achar the matter proceeded to the contrary, when he had declined from the right way and was inclined to those things which are in the world?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very much so; for the discourse was evident.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But it is necessary that holy men everywhere be found simple in morals, not inconsistent in their opinion; but this will be plain from that which the law openly says: "A man's vessels shall not be on a woman, nor again shall a man be clothed with a woman's garment, for whoever does this is an abomination in the sight of the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> For God abhors and considers a most shameful spectacle both the opinion of fortitude in a soft life (for this is for a man's vessels to be on a woman), and the languor of a soft mind in a strong man (for this is exactly as if a man were clothed with a woman's garment).</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What kind of thing is that which you say?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Is not hypocrisy a perverse and wicked thing both with God and with men?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is true.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, if someone is voluptuous and intemperate, and is convicted of being such from his very deeds; then he studies to acquire for himself a feigned opinion of probity; do you approve this man, Palladius?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> By no means indeed.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But indeed a man truly temperate and honest, ought he not to be considered firm in the same opinion, and not diverse from what he is?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I confess it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, let not the opinion of fortitude ever enter the sense of certain soft and effeminate men; for this is: "Let not a man's vessels be on a woman"; nor again let that truly strong man seek softness; for this is in turn: "Let not a man be clothed with a woman's garment": for the vice is equal in each matter, and these crimes do a similar injury to virtue.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Softness of mind is a dangerous thing, as it seems, and not without penalty.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do not doubt it at all. For that vice is indeed to be abhorred and is hateful to God. And so he is rejected from the sacred legions, who is held by crimes of this kind; for I think it necessary that he who is truly strong and strenuous should nowhere allow his mind to be broken through carelessness, but should keep it free from all fear and hesitation; and relying on perfect faith, should say: "I can do all things in him who strengthens me, Christ"<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>; and let him beware lest he wish to be wise in earthly things, since that thing brings perdition to us and shows us to be wicked before God. Therefore again it is written in Deuteronomy: "If you go out to war against your enemies, and see horse and rider, and a people greater than you, do not be afraid of them, because the Lord your God is with you, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. And it shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak to the people, and shall say to them: 'Hear, Israel, you are approaching today to battle against your enemies; do not let your heart be weak, do not fear, nor be broken, nor turn away from before them; because the Lord your God, who goes before you, will fight with you against your enemies, to save you.' And the scribes shall speak to the people, saying: 'What man is there who has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the war, and another man dedicate it. And what man is there who has planted a vineyard and has not been made joyful from it? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the war, and another man be made joyful from it. And what man is there who has betrothed a wife and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the war, and another man take her.' And the scribes shall add to speak to the people, and shall say: 'What man is there who is fearful and fainthearted in heart? Let him go and return to his house, lest he make the heart of his brother afraid like his own heart.'"<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But that it is necessary, relying on the help of God, to excel in virtues and to act manfully for good things, I myself would also say. But how or in what manner some are sent away from the war as unfit, I am not able to understand.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do you not know that he would not be well-pleasing to God, nor would anyone choose to endure labors for piety towards Him, unless he considered life in this world as a sojourn? This very thing was written for us most excellently and clearly, as in an image and figures, in the ways of life of the saints. For the divine Abraham sojourned in tents, and made a hasty journey from places to places; and all Israel frequently made departures through the desert, and dwelt in tents. The prophet David also gloried greatly in this, thus speaking to God: "Spare me, for I am a sojourner on the earth and a stranger, as all my fathers were."<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> And he vehemently sought those heavenly dwellings, thus saying: "How beloved are your tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! My soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> Therefore, such men think about the things above, and thirst for the dwellings in the heavens, which the Savior Himself promises to those who love Him, saying: "I go and prepare a place for you, and I will come again and receive you to myself, that where I am, you also may be with me."<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> Therefore, he who cannot bear to consider the present life as a sojourn bears the figure of him who builds a house and is studiously intent on this work; but of a covetous and avaricious man, he who plants a vineyard; but he who has been given over to the love of women and enervated by pleasures, and who has handed over his mind to the following of the flesh, can be signified by him who has gone to betroth a wife. Therefore, by the voice of the military herald, they depart from that sacred cohort most fit for battle. But what was likely that those who were implicated in vices of this kind would think and say, the herald first proclaimed. But can it be denied that those who labor with vices of this kind willingly embrace a vacation from labors in persecutions, and do not follow the studies which are to be undertaken for the love of God, while they think that in that contest, if it happens that they suffer anything, they will lose houses, possessions, and the fruits of most dear things? From which it happens that they are found fearful and lazy. Therefore, what was consistent that they should both think and say, the same the scribes proclaimed, striking the lazy man with oblique reproaches and facetious reproofs, excusing excuses in sins, and collecting worldly pleasures as a kind of bait for fear. Wherefore God commanded that the military herald should utter the last word open and uncovered: "And the scribes," it says, "shall add to speak to the people, and shall say: 'If there is any man fearful and fainthearted in heart, let him go to his house, lest he make the heart of his brother afraid like his own heart.'"<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> For he seems almost to say this: He who clings to earthly things, and builds houses, and plants vineyards, and is bound by carnal pleasures, will be altogether fearful and unwarlike; but a man of this kind is altogether disapproved, and will give damage to others; for evil conversations corrupt good manners<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>; and he who is easily conquered by fear sometimes also draws a strong and great-souled man to laziness. Therefore the blessed Paul also rebukes some who wished to prevent him from going up to Jerusalem; for he says: "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup> Also to be noted is that this was the excuse of those who were invited to the wedding: "I have bought a farm, I have taken a wife, and I cannot come."<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup> For so it is written in the gospel parables. But it is by no means difficult to give faith to this matter from ancient examples, if it so seems.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Speak therefore without any delay; for you will have done a most useful thing.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore we read thus in Numbers: "And afterwards the people set out from Aseroth and encamped in the desert of Pharan. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Send men, and let them spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the sons of Israel for a possession, one from each tribe; according to the peoples of their families you shall send them, every one a leader among them. And Moses sent them from the desert of Pharan by the voice of the Lord; all were leading men of the sons of Israel."<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> Then, having numbered those who were sent, by tribes and families, he adds again: "And when they had gone up, they spied out the land from the desert of Sin to Rehob, as far as the entrance of Hamath."<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup> And after some things: "And they came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and carried it on a pole, and also of the pomegranates and of the figs; and they called that place the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the sons of Israel cut down from there. And they returned from there, after spying out the land, after forty days, and going they came to Moses and Aaron, and to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel in the desert of Pharan, at Kades. And they answered them with a word, and to the whole congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land, and narrated to them, saying: We came into the land to which you sent us, a land flowing with milk and honey; and this is its fruit: except that the people who inhabit it are bold, and the cities are fortified and very great; and we saw the offspring of the Anakim there."<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup> You understand that the timid and fearful spies of the promised land plainly confessed that region to be apt for bearing vines and fertile, and abounding with ripe fruits: but they added things which would instill fear: namely a bold people who inhabited there, also saying repeatedly that the cities were fortified and walled, and leading the people of Israel away from hope of victory, and impelling them by fear to laziness.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> So it is.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But those who were wise and strenuous among them, Caleb and Joshua, opposed their vain speeches, saying to the people and to Moses: "By no means; but going up we will go up, and we will possess it; for we will be able to prevail against them."<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup> But the others who had been sent made no end of asserting that the land of promise would be impregnable for the sons of Israel. Then it says: "And the whole congregation gave a voice, and the people wept that whole night; and all the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation of the sons of Israel said to them: Would that we had died in the land of Egypt, or in this wilderness if we had died! And why does the Lord bring us into this land, to fall in war? Our wives and children will be for plunder. Now therefore it is better for us to return to Egypt."<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> To such unhappiness and laziness the whole congregation had fallen. When indeed Joshua the son of Nun tried to transfer them to firmness of mind in some way, and tore his garment, and was preaching many praises about that land, they were unwilling to confirm their minds; but foolishly rejecting their own defender, they gravely offended God, and attributed that they could become possessors of their hope to their own virtues. Therefore He also swore, saying: "If any of these men shall see the land which I swore to their fathers, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun."<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup> Is it therefore doubtful that a fearful man, and impatient of labor, and of little faith, also destroys others with himself, whom he corrupts with evil conversations, and is devoid of that lot and hope in God; but on the contrary, that the strong and strenuous man, and master of hope, will also be a friend of God?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> To me indeed it is not doubtful; for it has been sufficiently proven.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, as we said at the beginning, he who is detained by worldly pleasures is unfit to be numbered in the spiritual battle line.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And deservedly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> I would also add this (for I think that which can be profitable is to be greatly observed): that he who has recently begun to cultivate some virtue is by no means yet fit for the fight, but can be easily turned aside to vice.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How do you assert that?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> In Deuteronomy it is written: "If any man has recently taken a wife, he shall not go out to war, nor shall any business be imposed on him. He shall be free in his house for one year, he shall cheer his wife whom he has taken."<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup> Therefore, Palladius, is it to be understood simply and literally, and the author of the law, although he is a lover of virtue, places the fighter in his house, and does not permit him to seek praise from virtue, overcome by the gentle and frigid company of a woman, and the desire of the flesh prevailing over the things of necessity?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> By no means would I concede that this is what pleased the author of the law; but it is fitting that some probable reason lies hidden in that matter.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore I will repeat that very thing which I said. He who has touched virtue, and has not yet attained it perfectly, can easily be turned aside to the contrary.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Say in what way. For I do not yet quite follow.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Solomon certainly says: "Say that wisdom is your sister, and make prudence your familiar friend."<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> For we make virtues familiar to us if we strive especially to bear fruit from them: for he, for example, who is versed in the knowledge of things, or he who gives attention to meekness and gentleness, or certainly another virtue of this kind which he has proposed to himself. Therefore, as soon as the mind has begun to be moderately versed in things of this kind, will it be suitable and strong to be approved? And he who has recently begun to be familiar with wisdom, if he falls in with those who pervert right things, will he not rather be perverted than conquer, and drive away their destruction, since he is not yet sufficiently stable and fixed in wisdom?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It seems consistent.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Besides, he who studies meekness, if he is not yet exercised in that virtue, when provoked by someone, will he not easily become angry?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I think so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But the exercised wise man will fight with the wise, and will bravely oppose right reason to their cunning.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is true.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But what about him who has perfectly attained meekness, will he not be difficult to anger, although he is sometimes provoked by some?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I confess it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Rightly therefore the law, when it had elegantly depicted virtue as the spouse of the saints in the likeness of a woman, says: "If any man has recently taken a wife, he shall not go out to war, nor shall any duty be imposed on him; he shall be free in his house for one year, he shall cheer his wife whom he has taken."<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> For it does not permit him to be burdened with labors and persecutions, who has recently been joined and is of a more recent zeal for virtue; but it allows him, as free from care and remaining at home and alone, to be strengthened by the loves of virtue. We will find that the holy apostles did something of this kind, who write wisely to the gentiles recently converted and called to the knowledge of God: "For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose no further burden on you, except that you abstain from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood."<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> For, passing over the heavier precepts of wise governance, they ordered them to observe a few and necessary things, since they were not ignorant of the weak powers in enduring harsh things of those who had a little before been brought to the worship of God. Therefore, to men of this kind, that God of all things remits both angers and faults, even if they fall into the vice of a small mind, while they enter the unaccustomed way of labors. But afterwards He exacts punishments, and subjects to the commotions of His anger those who, when they can no longer plead the weakness of disuse of labors, rather cast themselves headlong into allurements and softness, most willingly pouring themselves out into their own madness. But is not virtue arduous, and the access to it rough, and must he sweat who wishes to become master of it?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I confess it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Nor is it absurd, but indeed equitable and fitting, that those who are recently led to this are not yet sufficiently confirmed with alacrity of mind, but as if they still walk with tender feet, and labor with weakness, he governs with indulgent moderation; and on the contrary, that man who is more exercised is governed more harshly with terror, and is led as if by a certain necessity to the endurance of labor and the facility of obedience.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You reason very well.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Nor indeed is that matter obscure, if we wish to diligently inquire into those things which happened in the figure to those ancient men. For thus it is written: "And Moses brought forth the children of Israel from the Red Sea, and led them into the desert of Sur: and they walked three days in the desert, and found no water to drink. And they came into Marah, and they could not drink the water from Marah; for it was bitter. Therefore he called the name of that place Bitterness. And the people murmured against Moses, saying: What shall we drink? And Moses cried to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree, and he cast it into the water, and the water was made sweet."<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup> For recently having set out from the land of the Egyptians, the children of Israel, having cast off the heavy and intolerable yoke of that servitude by which they were oppressed under their rule, were hastening, God calling, to the land once promised to the fathers. And the first labor that met them was from the lack of waters, which at last after they had labored long they found; and yet the use of them was not free from trouble, for they were bitter, as it is written; but by the application of the wood they were made sweet and pleasant, when God had shown the blessed Moses the way by which this might be done. For when the divine law teaches us, extracted from the servitude of vices, to worship God, it is necessary to sweat under the labor of temptations; and by the labors of a more severe exercise, consuming the vices of the flesh, and by taming with toil and hunger those fierce motions which always look to pleasure, not unlike a foul and monstrous beast, to obtain that crown of praise. For those wishing to hold the virtue of continence, the first fight against the flesh and its vices meets us; nor can anyone ever cultivate virtue by any other method. Therefore that thirst which happened to those ancient men in the desert is a figure of the labors of a more severe exercise; and the things which pertain to the body are the beginnings of exercises. For I would wish you to observe, that they did not fall into war from the very beginning; for those who have recently begun to conduct themselves against vices and to execute the duties of virtue, are not immediately received into battle against principalities and powers, because those who are exercised are still little strenuous and not sufficiently firm; but they are exercised in labors undertaken against the flesh; because God measures the labor's trouble of those who are tempted by habit and faculty. And this is that, I think: "Let no temptation take you but what is human: but God is faithful, who will not permit you to be tempted above what you are able, but will make also with the temptation an issue, that you may be able to bear it."<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup> Therefore labors, although they are very bitter, are made sweet and pleasant by Christ, who is both called and is the wood of life. But He Himself also says indeed in the evangelical Scriptures: "If they have done these things in the green wood, what shall be done in the dry?"<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup> calling Himself evidently the green and flourishing wood. Moreover, the wood is shown by God to the blessed Moses. For the Father alone reveals the Son, because He alone also knows Him. "For no one knows who the Son is, except the Father."<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup> Therefore through Christ, the wood of life, the things which are bitter are made sweet, the things which by their nature tend to bring destruction are made useful, and the things which could scarcely be borne and had become accustomed to vice are made tolerable.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> In what way?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Inasmuch as it is true that labors, although they are very bitter, kill the body, but make the soul a partaker of eternal life. Therefore the blessed Paul also said: "When I am weak, then I am strong."<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup> And again: "For though our outward man is corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day by day."<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup> But who at last would wish to endure such harsh labors, unless he had a sweet hope in Christ?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> No one at all, I think.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> See therefore (for now, Palladius, it is necessary to repeat those things which we said from the beginning) Israel thirsting in the desert, and murmuring against the most wise man Moses, and yet, having lapsed into such a dejection of mind with impunity; for he was not punished, nor did he sustain the vengeance of divine wrath, although God was accustomed to punish the guilty of that crime. For he is worthy of mercy from the beginning, who in exercise, having undertaken virtue, sometimes slips; but afterwards that excessive smallness of soul, and the unbridled course to absurd lusts, is without pardon. Therefore in Numbers the sacred Scriptures narrate concerning the children of Israel: "And we set out from the mountain of God by a journey of three days; and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them a way of three days to explore for them a rest. And it came to pass, when the ark was carried, Moses said: Arise, O Lord, and let your enemies be scattered; and let all who hate you flee. And when it was set down, he said: Return, O Lord, to the many thousands in Israel. And the cloud made a shadow over them by day, when they set out from the camps: and the people were murmuring very badly against the Lord. And the Lord heard, and was angry with wrath, and a fire was kindled in them by the Lord; and it devoured a certain part of the camps. And the people cried to Moses. And Moses prayed to the Lord, and the fire ceased; and the name of that place was called Burning, because a fire was kindled in them by the Lord..."<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup> And after these things again: "And they set out from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, they went around the land of Edom; and the people were fatigued on the way, and the people spoke against God and against Moses, saying: Why have you brought us out of the land of Egypt, to kill us in the desert? For there is no bread, nor water; and our soul loathes this light bread. And the Lord sent among the people fiery serpents, and they bit the people; and many of the children of Israel died..."<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup> You see therefore, how that murmuring and complaining people were consumed by fire and serpents. For they set out indeed from the mountain of God, when the ark went before them, and sought rest for them, Moses also prayed and entreated, the cloud also covered them: but they, calling the bread given from heaven light, complained greatly about God and Moses. For which cause necessarily some of them were made the object of fire, others immediately perished by the bites of serpents.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But what is to be observed in each place of Scripture, and what is the mountain of God?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The mountain of God, I think, is called Sinai, on which the Maker of all things descended in the appearance of fire, and was seen by all the people, as it is written, and He established laws of things to be done: "For He established there for the children of Israel justifications and judgments..."<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup> Moreover, He who once established those things, was Christ. Therefore He calls those laws given through Moses, His own words. For He says: "Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall not pass from the law, until all be done. Heaven and earth shall pass, but my words shall not pass."<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> Come therefore, leaving the crassness of the history, let us contemplate the subtlety of spiritual senses. Therefore, those who have already been deemed worthy of the sight and knowledge of God, and have beheld the splendor of the divine nature with the eyes of the mind, as if on a mountain, that is, in the highest and very sublime excellence (for that glory and nature of God is above all things), who in a certain way have exhibited themselves to Christ through faith, and have heard His words, and have promised obedience (for that also Israel did then, when they said: "All things whatsoever the Lord your God has said, we will do, and we will hear"<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup>); they will enjoy that divine providence, which now befits the household; nor will they be without the divine care for themselves, insofar as it is sufficient for their salvation; for they will have Him Himself as leader, and defender, and precursor, who will seek rest for them. For the first Christ on our behalf and for us once opposed Satan the victor, when He fasted and was tempted in the desert, so that we, seeing him conquered, and cast down, and prostrate under our feet, might have rest. Therefore He also said: "You shall have tribulation in the world: but have confidence, I have overcome the world."<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup> And again: "Behold, I have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy."<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup> The first on our behalf and for us engaged with death, dissolved indeed its empire, but provided rest for us, when He had renewed us to immortality. The first entered into paradise, when as it were He restrained that flaming sword that turned every way, and turned away sin from us, which was prohibiting us from entrance; for He Himself paid the debt for us, and by His bruise we are healed,<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup> as it is written. The first ascended to the Father and God, when He initiated for us that supernal entrance, and prepared those supernal mansions. Therefore He also said: "I go to prepare a place for you."<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup> Therefore Christ was prefigured in the ark: for it was built from incorruptible woods, and contained in itself the divine law, which is the Word of God. Moreover, that mystery can be seen in Christ, since it also agrees with this matter. For the Word of God was in an incorruptible temple. Therefore the ark went before, about to provide rest for the children of Israel; so also Christ goes before us, in the ways which we have just mentioned: and therefore, fulfilling the office of mediator, He becomes an advocate with the Father, and a propitiation for us; as once also Moses, who, when the ark set out, said: "Arise, O Lord, let your enemies be scattered, and let all who hate you flee."<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup> But when it was set down: "Return, O Lord, to the many thousands in Israel."<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup> For when He rose again to help us, the Only-begotten, who once said by the voice of the Psalmist: "Because of the misery of the needy, and the groans of the poor, now will I arise, says the Lord"<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup>; then the enemies fell, and fled, who were opposing and fighting against the glory of God. For He triumphed on the cross over principalities and powers,<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup> and by death destroyed the prince of this world, as it is written; and, the whole dispensation being in a certain way completed and brought to an end through the resurrection from the dead, and the ascension into heaven to the Father, He converted the whole earth, and made thousands of His own worshippers: "For when I shall be lifted up from the earth," He said, "I will draw all things to myself."<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup> Therefore that prayer of Moses was not absurdly a figure of the intercession of Christ, when from the human condition He prays and asks from God the Father the most excellent things for us. For as the blessed John says: "We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just; and he is the propitiation for our sins; not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world."<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup> Moreover, we have Him as a protector, as He is understood in the overshadowing cloud: for he who is justified by the faith which he has in Him hears: "The sun shall not burn you by day, nor the moon by night."<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup> Some also say in that distribution of reward according to the gospel parable, "We have borne the burden of the day and the heat"<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup>: meaning, unless I am mistaken, the vehement and sharp force of wild pleasures, or perhaps also the heat of temptations for burning, calling it the burden of the day and the heat: therefore Christ is our helper and protector for salvation. Therefore, whoever, after they have been deemed worthy of the sight of God, and have heard the divine preachings, and through the profession of faith made, have promised as it were that they would be hearers, having changed for the worse, have rejected Him going before and leading, Christ, I say, who provides rest for them, who intervenes for them in the person of a mediator, who is understood for us in the figure of a protector; these at some time most justly, by the recurrence of their own folly, will pay the penalties of their sins by fires: and this is that, I think, which that wise man Paul also said: "For if we sin willingly after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there is now left no sacrifice for sins, but a certain dreadful expectation of judgment, and the rage of a fire which shall consume the adversaries."<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup></p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, those who have rejected the whole dispensation which is understood in Christ, by the guilt of sin, will be food for fire. Moreover, that murmuring, as it seems, signifies apostasy, and their unwillingness to willingly embrace the salvation proceeding from Him, although they have tasted the grace of God, and hold the experience of things now past as a firm pledge of future things.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> So I say. Others also, since they were faint-hearted, complained in the same manner, and murmured ungratefully against God and Moses, calling that manna given from heaven light bread. But they perished by serpents: for those who by their ingratitude despise that Savior and Redeemer of all men, and hold the grace of His liberality in no account, and moreover reject His life-giving word, and the gift of the Holy Spirit as useless, fall into the bite of the cruel serpent. But those who have not lapsed into such grave faults, together with wickedness will also escape the imminent punishment and penalties, and will overcome the enemies: "For they shall walk upon the asp and the basilisk, and shall trample the lion and the dragon."<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup> It is concluded therefore, and proven to us by the testimony of the very events, that it is dangerous for those who are already exercised, and have bestowed some care and labor, so that from labors they might obtain praise, but being now versed and accustomed to undertaking sweats for virtue, to become sluggish through laziness, and to cast themselves into idleness.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Concluded, and indeed truly.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But our discourse affirmed, not only that it is a crime hateful to God and liable to punishment, to murmur against God and to cast down the soul; so that pusillanimity itself is a certain complaint and accusation concerning the kindness of the Savior, although small labors are in the midst: but also that it is an abomination to seek remission and relaxation of life, whatever is at hand, to enjoy the divine gifts without blame nourished by heavenly words, to be carried away to corruptible pleasures and impure desires with unbridled eagerness: for to prefer vicious things is a manifest injury to the best and saving things; and that calculation of mind is most wicked, by which earthly things, although they contain the greatest turpitude in themselves, are preferred to heavenly things; and rightly the prophet Isaiah almost weeps over these, saying: "Woe to you that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter."<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup> We will find the sons of Israel entangled in such evil faults. For after they paid the penalty for murmuring, immediately they labored with a neighboring and connected disease of desire for the most shameful things. For, as if rejecting the gifts of God in a way, and bearing the celestial gifts with impatience not without impiety, they necessarily moved the judge against themselves. For it is written: "And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted with desire, and the children of Israel also sat down and wept, and said: Who will give us flesh to eat? We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing, and the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic. But now our soul is dry; our eyes look upon nothing but manna. And Moses heard the people weeping by their families, every one at the door of his tent; and the Lord was very angry, and it appeared evil in the eyes of the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup> Do you not think it worthy of divine wrath and condemnation from holy men, that those already exercised should descend to that softness and ignoble thinking, so that they labor with an impotent desire to return to such base impurities, and are dissolved in such intemperance, as to weep childishly as if not bearing the sharp attack of desire?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But when the all-wise Moses was distressed, and had a terrible anxiety on this account, and cried out openly, that he could never alone sustain a people so easily going to madness and apostasy, God appointed men, seventy in number, as associates and helpers of his care, whom He also made more illustrious by the gift of the Holy Spirit (for they prophesied in the camp). And to Moses He says: "And you shall say to the people: Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat flesh, because you have wept before the Lord, saying: Who will give us flesh to eat? It was well with us in Egypt: and the Lord will give you flesh to eat, and you shall eat flesh; not for one day shall you eat flesh, nor for two days, nor for five days, nor for ten days, nor for twenty days: until a month of days you shall eat, until it comes out of your nostrils, and becomes loathsome to you, because you have resisted the Lord who is among you, and have wept before him, saying: Why did we go out of Egypt?"<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup> For it grieved that Redeemer exceedingly that Israel did not care even for servitude itself, and considered the labors of Egypt, for the desire of flesh and ill-smelling herbs, as nothing. To us also often burning and sharp desires persuade that light servitude under the dominion of the devil is to be borne, and the yoke of sin is to be undertaken for corruptible and earthly desires in place of God. But then also He granted to eat flesh not for one, nor for ten, but for thirty days; by which is signified the long duration of the divine wrath against them. He permits even now those who have intemperately turned aside to worldly pleasures, to enjoy, if they wish, carnal desires, and indeed sometimes for a longer time. For it is said that He delivered some up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which are not fitting.<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup> But that food was turned into cholera for them: and likewise for those who love carnal things, and prefer corruptible and earthly things to that spiritual manna, that is, the word of God, that endeavor will end in the destruction of death, and this is that, I think: "He who sows in the flesh, from the flesh shall reap corruption."<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup> But perhaps the release from such a disease is this: "Walk in the spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary one to another."<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup> For if the Israelites had been willing to think that the distribution of manna was sufficient for their pleasure, which is the intelligible bread of angels, and a figure of that sweetness which is given through the Spirit, they would never have fulfilled the lust of the flesh, nor would they have reaped corruption from it.<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup> But the monuments of that people were most notable: for there, it says, they buried the lusting people, according to that: "They shall be a sight to all flesh"<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup>; and he who was affected by that evil is called the lusting people, according to that, I think, which is said concerning some: "Whose glory is in their shame"<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup>; for from sin their appellation is derived, and a wretched and endless reproach for their cowardice was inscribed upon the dead, and the mark of those things for which they were condemned was written as a kind of title.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is so.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, those who wish to be truly disciples must especially avoid that impatience in labors, and idle murmuring, and ungrateful vanity of speech, and, what is more impious than the rest, beware lest we seek the pollutions which proceed from wickedness and fleshly desires. For he who is so affected, wavers to both sides, and has the hips of his reason limping. For it is written: "Woe to fearful hearts, and faint hands, and the sinner that goes in two ways."<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup> But it is necessary, in my opinion, that those who value patience and the endurance of sustaining in all things, remember Christ saying: "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me"<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup>; that is, if anyone wishes to be my disciple, let him eagerly follow the same course of passions which I held, and as it were enter upon the same way and love it: for he will rest with me and abide together: for this He Himself asked for us from God the Father, when He said: "I will that where I am, they also may be with me."<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup> We are also with Christ in another way, when we live indeed on earth, yet we do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the spirit, and we study to have that which pleases Him as our inn and rest. You have the figure of this thing written in Numbers: "And on the day," it says, "that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the house of the testimony; and in the evening there was over the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until the morning: so it was always, the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night; and when the cloud went up from the tabernacle, then the children of Israel went forward; and in the place where the cloud stood, there the children of Israel encamped. At the commandment of the Lord the children of Israel encamped, and at the commandment of the Lord they marched. All the days that the cloud abode upon the tabernacle, they remained in the camps; and when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, the children of Israel kept the watch of the Lord, and did not march; and it came to pass, when the cloud was upon the tabernacle for a number of days, at the commandment of the Lord they remained in the camps, and at the commandment of the Lord they marched; and it came to pass, when the cloud was from evening until morning, and the cloud was taken up in the morning, they marched by day, or by night, and when the cloud was taken up, they marched by day, or for a month of days, the cloud abiding and overshadowing it, the children of Israel remained in the camps, and did not march; because they marched at the commandment of the Lord; they kept the watch of the Lord at the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses."<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup> When the holy tabernacle was erected in the desert, it says that a cloud filled it; then that God commanded the children of Israel to set out together with it, and to halt together, most carefully observing the times of setting out again and again: by which very thing, He indicated to those who wished to be slothful that the transgression of this matter is dangerous. And so indeed, as far as pertains to the history, let these things be said. Now let us contemplate the same things spiritually. For as soon as that most true tabernacle, that is, the Church, was erected and raised upon the earth, it was filled with the glory of Christ: for, that the old tabernacle was covered with a cloud, signifies nothing else, in my opinion, but this. Therefore Christ filled the Church with His glory; and to those indeed who are in ignorance and error, as if in night and darkness, He shines like fire, sending no doubt spiritual illumination; but to those who are already illuminated, and in whose heart the spiritual day has dawned, He bestows from Himself shadow and protection, and enriches them with spiritual dew, that is, with supernal and spiritual consolations brought by the Spirit He enriches them: for this is, that He is seen as if in the appearance of fire by night, but in the appearance of a cloud by day. For children still needed illumination and enlightenment, which would lead them to the knowledge of God: but those who were above these, and already illuminated through faith, needed protection and help, so that they might bravely bear the heat of the present life and the burden of the day: for "All who will live piously in Christ, shall suffer persecution."<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup> Moreover, when the cloud departed, the tabernacle also set out together; and the children of Israel did the same with it: for the Church follows Christ everywhere, and that holy multitude of believers is never separated from Him who calls to salvation.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But how shall we understand our protection, and the cessation of our journey, with Christ going before and leading?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> There is no distinction between these words of Scripture, in my opinion; since both this very thing, to set out together with the cloud, and that, to halt together, shows as it were a figure of our will, by which we desire to be with God. Nevertheless, to call the mind to as subtle an understanding as can be, we will say this, that the first setting out is that by which we set out from infidelity to faith, and from ignorance to knowledge, and from ignorance of Him who is by nature and truly God, to a clear knowledge of Him, who is both Lord and Creator of all things. But the setting out after this, now called the second, is that, and very useful, when from wickedness and intemperance we tend so that we now begin both to think and to do better things. The third is more excellent and more glorious, when from that state in which something is lacking we pass to the perfection of deeds and doctrine at the same time. Do we not gradually tend to the increase which is understood in Christ, when we advance to the perfect man, and ascend to the measure of the age of the fullness of Him?<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup> And this is that perhaps, which is sung to us by the voice of the blessed Paul, "Forgetting the things that are behind, and stretching forth myself to those that are before, I press towards the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation."<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup> When therefore we set out spiritually from ignorance to knowledge, from folly to wisdom, from infidelity to faith, and always advance in virtues, do we not migrate from place to place, and from a certain affection, do we not seem in a way very similar?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I understand what you say.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But neither can anyone set out from wickedness, nor indeed arrive at better things, and in a way turn aside, unless Christ is his companion and leader. Therefore He said to His holy disciples: "Without me you can do nothing."<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup> Therefore from that which is to set out together, the cloud setting out, and likewise to rest together with it resting, this is declared, as through a riddle, to be with God, and to do all things with Him. But, he says, they set out by the commandment of the Lord they marched<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup>: and this, in my opinion, signifies that those who have determined to follow Christ, also need the word, which exhorts to fortitude and honesty, which becomes saints; for he says: "Let all things be done decently and according to order."<sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup> The figure of that thing is also what we read written subsequently; for thus God says to Moses the interpreter of sacred things: "Make for yourself two trumpets of beaten work; of silver you shall make them, and they shall be for you to call the assembly, and for the camps to move. And you shall sound with them, and all the assembly shall be gathered to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony. And if they sound with one, all the princes and leaders of Israel shall come to you: and you shall sound the second signal, and the camps that are pitched towards the east shall march: and you shall sound the second signal again, and the camps that are pitched towards the south shall march; and you shall sound the third signal, and the camps that are pitched towards the sea shall march; and you shall sound the fourth signal, and the camps that are pitched towards the north shall march: they shall sound the signals at their marching: and when you gather the assembly, you shall sound the trumpet indeed, but not the signal. And the sons of Aaron the priests shall sound with the trumpets; and it shall be a perpetual ordinance for you throughout your generations."<sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup></p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What therefore do we say that pair of trumpets is? And what the difference of the signals? Moreover, why were they ordered to be made of beaten work, and from silver?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The two trumpets indeed are the twofold kind of preaching adapted for exhortation in the churches; one of which leads believers to right doctrines, and marks the speech of perverse men as adulterated; such was the speech of those who forbade to marry, and most absurdly taught to abstain from foods, which God created to be received by the faithful<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup>: among these I would also reckon the teachers of the Jews; who, casting away that which was approved and holy by the divine law, as if it were obsolete, and holding it in no account, commanded disciples to acquiesce in their own doctrines and human mandates. Some others also foolishly taught those who were justified by faith to be circumcised, so that they might glory in the flesh of others, as it is written.<sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup> But concerning them it is said: "Without are dogs, and evil workers."<sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup> But the other kind leads to the correction of morals, and declares the way of that conversation in Christ. Moreover, the trumpets are of silver: in which the nature of the metal elegantly shows the proper virtue of preaching and its greatest splendor and sincerity. And with the trumpets, he says, let the people be called to the tabernacle. For by preaching we gather those who dwell as if in private tabernacles, to the churches: whom, when they have come together, we also exhort, that they may set out from less honorable deeds to those which become sanctified men, and we teach excellently that they should in a way migrate from wickedness to good morals.But can it be denied that preaching leads an obedient and compliant man, and a true lover of that life in Christ, to right understanding of doctrines and correction of morals?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I confess it does.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, for a long time the trumpets have been with you, by which you call the people to the tabernacle. But if they sound with one trumpet, it says, all the princes and leaders of the sons of Israel will come. For they too, I think, need admonition and exhortation, even those who are in a more perfect state: but not as much as the rest of the multitude requires; and for that reason, indeed, they call all others with difficulty over a long time with trumpets, but the wise with one; for to the wise a few things are enough: and if he receives the opportunity, he will add the rest, according to that saying: "Give an opportunity to the wise, and he will be wiser; make it known to the just, and he will add to receive."<sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup> Then He commanded that four different signals be given, by which the camps would move, and set forth those who were towards the east and west, north and south. Through this, therefore, I think the four books of the Gospels are signified, through which the whole world is imbued with the knowledge of doctrines and morals at the same time. And if anything else must be thought out and said, we shall not hesitate; and we shall prefer the consideration of utility to sloth and labor. Therefore, we shall find four distinctions of our preaching, through which the whole world will hold the best, and indeed the most approved rule of life; one and the first, by which we are accustomed to call to the knowledge of the truth and the reception of the divine Spirit those who serve the creature rather than the Creator, and foolishly say to the wood: "You are my father," and to the stone: "You have begotten me,"<sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup> as the prophet says. But those who have already believed will aptly fit the three remaining kinds of preaching; since indeed the Savior taught that there are three kinds of life and conversation; for He said that the seed sown on good ground bore fruit, one indeed a hundredfold, another sixtyfold, and a third thirtyfold.<sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup> Therefore, to each of these kinds there is a certain kind of speech most fitting: for we would not have acted rightly if we thought that those joined in lawful marriage, and on that account divided between God and the world, and likewise those who have undertaken the most excellent and religious life, or one suitable for the priestly office, should be helped by the same speeches without distinction, but we shall say to these: "Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed; are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife"<sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup>; and whatever else it is fitting for those joined in marriage both to think and to do. But to the religious, and to those who have decided to bear the harshness of a more severe life, "Mortify your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil desire."<sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup> And that, "The sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the future glory which shall be revealed in us."<sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup> Finally, to those who are called to the priesthood, "The lips of the priest shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law from his mouth"<sup><a href="#fn92" id="ref92">92</a></sup>; and whatever the most wise Paul commands writing to Timothy. Therefore, do these narratives which I have brought from the Scriptures stray from what is fitting, and are they turned aside to what is not right?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> By no means.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But observe that He assigns the use of the trumpets to the priests alone who are chosen, assigned, I think, to the teachers of the people and the consecrated priests, the preaching which teaches about the mysteries and instructs for the pursuit of virtue. And so for this reason, as I think, He says to Moses: "Make for yourself two trumpets."<sup><a href="#fn93" id="ref93">93</a></sup> And confirming this matter as if by law, "And the sons," He says, "of Aaron the priests shall sound with the trumpets; and it shall be for you a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations."<sup><a href="#fn94" id="ref94">94</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, we shall accept the modes of the signs, the speech aptly and fittingly offered to each condition of those living well and praiseworthily. Thus we shall also advance together with the cloud, and together we shall cease from the journey, that is, we shall walk spiritually with Christ, and together we shall rest.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You speak well. For thus the word of the prophet also persuades us to think, which is thus: "And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to do judgment, and to love mercy, and to be ready to walk with the Lord your God?"<sup><a href="#fn95" id="ref95">95</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But that it is a good thing, and worthy of all, and enriches with the glory of fortitude, to walk with the Lord your God, how could it not be clear? But what again that "to be ready" is, would you explain to me if you are willing.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Why not? For if thinking and quickly doing the things of God lie at our feet, and nothing hinders or draws us to a reprobate mind, this, I think, is to be ready to walk with God.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But whom altogether do we say are those who wish to follow God indeed, yet do not choose to do this with their whole soul, but yield on account of cowardice and reject steadfastness?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Those who, since they are slow, and scarcely progress to the point of willing to think the things which please God, do not yet adhere to holy conduct with a whole and entire mind, who assign a small part, as it were, of their existing zeal and eagerness to divine love, but all the rest they waste most wastefully and recklessly on the distractions of this life, and useless sweats and bitter cares; of whom the sons of Ruben and Gad might be a type: for it is written again in Numbers: "And there was a multitude of cattle for the sons of Ruben and the sons of Gad, a very great multitude. And they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead; and the place was a place for cattle; and the sons of Ruben and the sons of Gad came and said to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the synagogue, saying: Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, the land which the Lord delivered before the sons of Israel, is suitable for feeding cattle; and your servants have cattle. And they said: If we have found grace before you, let this land be given to your servants for a possession, and do not transfer us across the Jordan. And Moses said to the sons of Gad and the sons of Ruben: Shall your brothers go to war, and will you sit here? And why do you pervert the minds of the sons of Israel, so that they do not cross into the land which the Lord God gives them?"<sup><a href="#fn96" id="ref96">96</a></sup> Then, having reproached them with the obstinacy of their parents, and having recounted those things which for that reason happened to them: "For they died," he says, "in the desert," so that they did not even see, so to speak, the land of promise. He adds again: "And behold, you have risen up in place of your fathers, a conspiracy of sinful men, to add still more to the wrath of the indignation of the Lord against Israel, because you have turned away from Him, to add still more, to forsake Him in the desert, and to sin against this entire congregation. And they came to him and said: 'We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our belongings; and we, armed, will go in the front line before the sons of Israel, until we lead them into their place: and our belongings will be in fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land; nor will we return to our houses, until the sons of Israel are divided, each one into his possession, and we will no longer possess among them across the Jordan and beyond; because we have received our possessions in the place across the Jordan to the east...'"<sup><a href="#fn97" id="ref97">97</a></sup> You understand that these men, detained by the care of feeding cattle and of possessions, and by love for their wives and children, would by no means at all have crossed the Jordan, and indeed would not have dared to touch any part of war and battle at all, nor would they have cared to come into the communion of glory and the hope of good things with the others; since it seemed to them chief and especially desirable to remain there, not even having set foot, so to speak, in the waters of the Jordan: but with Moses reproaching them, and warning them to fear and dread the divine wrath, they at last promise that they will cross the Jordan together with the others, and share the labors in war and battle with them; yet not with that hope that they will be joint heirs of the possessions together, because they had received their possession across the Jordan. Some are very similar to these, who, since they are engrossed by the cares of the present life, and have in a way dedicated their whole heart to hoping in those things which are on the earth, place a very small care in necessary things, and count the things which are God's among the least serious. "For many are called, but few are chosen."<sup><a href="#fn98" id="ref98">98</a></sup> Those therefore who, as far as pertains to faith, are considered among the called, yet are not numbered among the elect, because they are too remiss towards pleasure; these are sometimes slow and very sluggish even to the very grace of holy baptism: and they shrink from enduring labors which befit the saints, for the glory of God and their own utility, and from suffering persecution together with the true servants of God, whenever the time demands it: but, with the law of God reproaching them, and the divine wrath sometimes deterring them, they come reluctantly to saving baptism, and share labors with the elect, either fasting together with the other more remiss, or sometimes undertaking the weariness of battle together, when the Church is attacked; yet they do not lift up their mind to the things which are in heaven, and despise the things which are in the world; but they return to the pleasures and delights of earthly things, as if to their assigned possession: and therefore Christ said to lovers of right thinking and students of cultivating piety: "Take heed, lest perhaps your hearts be weighed down with cares and worldly solicitudes."<sup><a href="#fn99" id="ref99">99</a></sup> But truly, Palladius, do you not confess that this matter is pernicious?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Why would I not confess it?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But if you cast the keen eyes of your mind upon the things which are written, you will admire in an extraordinary way the beauty of this image.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> In what way?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Those who, on account of feeding cattle, and for the zeal for children and wives, and also sheepfolds and buildings, became lazy towards excellent things, were Ruben and Gad.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But what is that?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For the one was the firstborn from Jacob, the other born from the handmaid Zilpah.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is true.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, these men were called firstborn on account of faith, and obtained an exceptional share of the inheritance with God, as pertains to grace; but yet, on account of a will inclined to things hardly honorable, they are not lovers of liberty; but we say that those who are justified by faith are called the church of the firstborn written in heaven.<sup><a href="#fn100" id="ref100">100</a></sup> But that firstborn was by no means a lover of liberty, but rather a companion and associate of those who did not escape the disgrace of servitude.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak excellently.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But now to me, while the discourse suggests one thing, another, as it were, throws ropes, it seems necessary to repeat and again to commemorate, that we must bravely do those things which are useful, and we must think that labors are an exercise of virtue, and we must not think otherwise than that God is the one who bestows salvation, and who grants, even if the adversaries rely on much greater forces than ours, that we can conquer. For Moses will teach that it is not useless to sweat, when we labor for virtue, who says in Deuteronomy: "And you shall remember all the way by which the Lord your God led you in the wilderness; that he might afflict you, and try you, and make known the things that were in your heart, if you would keep his commandments, or not."<sup><a href="#fn101" id="ref101">101</a></sup> Nor does He wish us to labor with slothful fear, when we see His protecting hand. Therefore again He writes to this effect: "But if you say in your heart: This nation is greater in number than I; how shall I be able to destroy them? You shall not fear them: remembering you shall remember all the things which the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and all the Egyptians: all the temptations which your eyes have seen, the signs and great wonders of them; and the hand of His power, and His outstretched arm, as the Lord your God led you; so will the Lord your God do to all the nations whom you fear in their presence."<sup><a href="#fn102" id="ref102">102</a></sup></p>
