    <h1>On Adoration in Spirit and Truth, Book I</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">Of St. Cyril, Archbishop of Alexandria</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">Concerning the fall of man into sin, the captivity of sin, and then concerning the calling and conversion which happens through repentance, and the return to a better life.</p>

               <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> From where or how to begin, I think would be superfluous to ask. For you will say, I know well, without hesitation, that you are from home, and to us.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But what is this book that you have in your hands?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> The Gospel book, written by Matthew and John.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do you think then that this book should be carried around anywhere and to anyone? For when you have gone out of doors on a journey, you cannot conveniently give yourself to meditation, Palladius. Truly, labors of this kind are pleasant at home and in leisure.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly. Moreover, I have come to converse with you. Furthermore, I bring this sacred book because, although I have labored long and much, I could by no means grasp what our Lord Jesus Christ wished to signify in Matthew, when he says: "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Furthermore, in the volume of John, to the Samaritan woman: "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But what seems to you difficult in these words, what obscure and hard to understand? Tell me, I ask you.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> The sacred Scriptures command us to depart from the ancient rites and to cease from the righteousness which is according to the Law. For to those who were inclined towards it even after receiving faith, Paul said: "You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness."<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> But when he shows that, on account of a life instituted according to the Law, they had great and glorious causes for boasting, he says again: "But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith."<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> And he clearly confirmed that the old commandment was not without fault. And therefore he said that in its place this new one through Christ, that is, the evangelical, was usefully introduced. For thus he writes: "For on the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness (for the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God."<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> And again: "For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second. For he finds fault with them when he says: 'Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, for they did not continue in my covenant, and so I showed no concern for them, declares the Lord. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws into their minds, and write them on their hearts.'"<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> And especially understanding and declaring the name of newness, he says, "In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">If therefore the Law made nothing perfect, and there was a rejection of the former commandment and a substitution of the latter, through which we are reconciled to God, why then does the Savior say, "I have not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it"? And that other saying, "God the Father must be worshiped in spirit and truth"? For this, unless I am mistaken, signifies that we must abstain from the rites and worship of the Law.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> What a vast sea of questions you are entering! For what power of mind is so great that it can direct a sufficiently clear gaze into such subtle disputations, so as to show that the new Scripture is akin and proximate to those things which were once sanctified by the most wise Moses, and deals with the same matters, and that the life in Christ is not far separated from the legal life, if the things prescribed to the ancients are transferred to a spiritual contemplation? For the law is a figure and a shadow, and a form of piety, as if still giving birth and containing within itself the hidden beauty of truth. Will you not say that the matter stands as I have said?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Absolutely so. But by what reasoning can these things be declared? Or how shall we live evangelically if we think we must still depend on the old commandment and fulfill the things sanctified through Moses?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The reasoning is not simple and single, as one might imagine; for virtue is a multiple and multiform thing; and the glory of the Christian life is variegated and adorned with very many good works. And so that divine David, in the forty-fourth psalm, makes the chaste virgin Church address Christ: and he places around her a golden and variegated robe, thus saying: "The queen stood at your right hand in gold of Ophir, surrounded and variegated."<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> Where by the term 'golden', splendor and preciousness are signified; and by the name 'variegated', the variety of virtue is best signified, as I think. For the Church is most beautiful altogether, having a spiritual ornament which is not perceived by the eyes of the flesh, but placed in the mind and in the heart, skillfully shows us that Jew who is distinguished and conspicuous with many ornaments, who is understood in secret. For as the blessed Paul writes: "For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God."<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Tell me therefore, if circumcision is introduced in the spirit, and the legal sacrifices are taken away, and that Jewish manner of living has no place among us, does it not seem somehow absurd that Christ says, "I have not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it"? Or if the matter is otherwise, I think there will be no hindrance to us from venerating God with the sacrifices of bulls and with incense, and offering turtledoves and pigeons; finally, whatever was customary for those ancient men to do, let us also strive to fulfill it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But you are wandering very far from the right, my friend. For you think the law is abolished in such a way that it is not allowed to receive any fruit from it, and you judge it to be utterly useless for declaring any part of necessary things, rather than that it has been converted for demonstrating the truth, since otherwise the blessed Paul writes: "Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law."<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> For the law is a pedagogue, and most excellently leads to the mystery of Christ.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> But those things which were once decreed through Moses for ancient men, we say are the elements of the beginning of the words of God.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> Therefore, if we reject the pedagogue, who will lead us to the mystery of Christ? And if we refuse to learn the elements of the beginning of the words of God, how or from where shall we afterwards be able to arrive at the end? For is not Christ, according to the Scriptures, the fullness of the law and the prophets?<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Yes.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For so it is written. But I think he is the fullness of the law and the prophets for this reason, because all the prophetic and legal oracles look towards him and are directed to him. And so he was saying, when he reproached the Jews for their unbelief: "Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope. For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">When therefore he says that he has come not to abolish the law but rather to perfect it, do not think that a subversion of those things once sanctified has occurred, but rather a reformation, and, so to speak, a recasting of those things which were shadowed forth in figures, into the expressed form of truth.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And it was fitting that something of this kind be done by Christ. Those who practice art in tablets and pictures do not, as soon as they begin to paint, introduce into the pictures that appearance which lacks nothing and is perfect in every part, but they first sketch them with a simpler and less graceful color, and expose to the eyes figures far more obscure than they wish. Finally, they apply to those shadows the color most fitting and suitable to each; thus they transfer the ruder figures to a clear and far more excellent appearance than before. Is it not so?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I admit it indeed.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Now indeed, brazen craftsmen, if by chance they wish to make a statue, first form a certain rough type from wax, and when that is consumed by fire, they pour in the liquefied metal, and thus bring the work to an absolute form and beauty. When a variety of colors is applied over those shadows, and when the fire has consumed those wax figures, it might seem that the former forms have been abolished and destroyed; but it is otherwise. For both the brazen craftsman and the painter would truly say: "We have indeed by no means destroyed the shadows, nor have we thrown away those rude figures as utterly useless, but rather we have fulfilled them." For what seemed more obscure and less graceful in the shadows and figures, has arrived at a better and more illustrious form.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And if anyone wishes to investigate seriously the sacred and divinely inspired Scripture, he will know altogether that what is said is true: for Moses used to put a veil over his face, because the children of Israel could not look intently at his face, as it is written.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup></p>
                <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What is it that is signified by this action?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For the minds of the Jews, since they were still rather weak, judged the exterior things of the law to be in some way tolerable; those things in which what was signified through the letter alone were to them; but those things which lay within, and, so to speak, the very true face of the meanings, seemed to them unbearable and to be wholly rejected. And so the blessed Paul also writes: "For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away. Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts."<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> But thus indeed let the affairs of the Jews be. "But we all," he says, "with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> For as those who are contemplated in a mirror see the image and figure of the real thing, not the thing itself, so those who desire to see the beauty of Christ's conversation, if they use the law as a mirror, will most excellently attain what they desire. For by transferring the very image of things to the truth, they will clearly perceive what is in the first place acceptable and pleasing to God.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But what reason can be adduced, why from the beginning the new and evangelical law was not given to those ancients, but rather figures and shadows were instituted?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> We ought piously and reverently to leave the accurate and true reason of this dispensation to God alone, to whom all things are known and explored. Yet reasons not alien to pious thoughts lead us to some small knowledge, or at least to such a degree that we may seem to know what was the cause of this plan. We say therefore, that when the Israelites were freed from Egypt, there was need of frequent instruction, long, and, so to speak, with the food of childhood; for they were still rude and very prone to all sorts of absurdities. Since they were laboring with a love of the flesh, and were entangled by perturbations which could be removed with difficulty and hardly extirpated, it was almost impossible, and by no means prompt, to wish to arrive immediately at the highest perfection and to undertake a manner of life so illustrious and admirable that, although walking on earth, they nevertheless had their conversation in heaven, as it is written.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> For is not solid food for the perfect, but milk more suitable for those still children?<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very much so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For children therefore there was need of instruction which was contained in figures, and, so to speak, with more delicate nourishment, not with that kind of discourse which would instruct to perfection and lead immediately to the absolute state in all duties. But so light and stupid, and easy to all kinds of perturbations, are the children of Israel found to be, that if you diligently weigh their manners and studies, they may be judged not even worthy of the shadow itself. And Moses shows this; for God thus commanding, he ascended the mountain to receive the law. But they immediately lapsed into defection; for having made a calf, the wretches dared to say: "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!"<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> Wherefore Moses, indignantly bearing such levity, broke the tablets on which the law was described; judging them indeed worthy not even of a shadow or figures, nor of any doctrine, since they had come to such stupidity that, forgetful of such great miracles which had been wrought by divine power for their sake, they again offered veneration to a calf, and recalled that Egyptian worship.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Furthermore, the law of God was shadowed forth for the ancients on stone tablets by the finger of God, as it is written.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> But those were figures of those things which among us are believed to be perfect in Christ. For the Lord of all, God, as if using his Son as a pen in the Spirit, inscribes in us in a certain way the knowledge of his will. For thus he called him through David, saying: "My tongue is the pen of a ready scribe."<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> For that pen of the Father, that is, the Son, has inscribed in the hearts of all the knowledge of every good, using as it were a certain finger of God, the Spirit of the Father and his own. For he called the Spirit of God a finger, sometimes indeed saying: "But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons,"<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> and sometimes: "But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons."<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> And Paul calls us a spiritual epistle, when he said: "You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, to be known and read by all. And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts."<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I indeed agree that the things contained in the law are figures and shadows. But come, let us subtly and accurately attend to the things handed down through figures, and diligently investigate the very beauty of truth; so at last the mystery of worship in spirit will be able to be obscure to no one.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Indeed, noble Palladius, I shudder very much, and not without reason, and I am exceedingly reluctant for this task. For the contemplation of these matters is so arduous and sublime that it can scarcely be grasped by human intellect. And if anyone considers the depth of the contemplations which lie hidden in the law, he will not absurdly be able to use those words: "Who is wise and he will understand these things? prudent and he will know them?"<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> A great and arduous work, Cyril. But "ask," says Christ, "and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> We must go therefore to investigate those things which can bring utility; and indeed let us stretch forth prayers beforehand, saying: "Uncover my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law."<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> It is necessary for us, as it seems, before other things to speak of the turning of man to worthlessness, and about servitude and captivity under the enemy of all, how and in what manner these things are accomplished by us and in us. And then to add, in what way one must depart from evil, and shake off the yoke of servitude under which we are held, and recover the original state, with God preserving and helping. For if our discourse proceeds along this fitting path, it will, I think, appropriately approach the remaining matters also.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You think most correctly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For to be able to bear fruit to God, to offer spiritual sacrifices, that is, to be zealous and to excel, wishing to accomplish virtue, would by no means be fitting for those thus freed from servitude and the compulsion of passions, but for those whose mind is already in some way recovering towards freedom, and is not unpracticed in shaking off the yoke of the devil's greed.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I agree, for you understand correctly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And now let us say that man was made in the beginning, having his mind somehow still above sin and passions, not however completely incapable of turning to that which he might choose. For it seemed right to the best craftsman of all, God, to entrust to him the reins of his own wills, and to commit the course to what seemed good to his spontaneous impulses. For virtue needed to be chosen voluntarily, and not as if done by necessity, nor yet supported unshakably by the laws of nature; for this would be the property of that substance which is supreme above all and excellent. But since the living being was perfected by the crafting God according to the principles of its own nature, it was immediately enriched with his likeness. For the image of the divine nature was stamped upon it, the Holy Spirit having been breathed in.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Was the divine spirit therefore made the soul of man?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> How would it not be most absurd to think so? For thus the soul itself would have remained unchangeable; but now it is changeable. But the Spirit is in no way changeable; if it labors under the disease of change, this weakness will pertain to the very nature of God; if indeed he is the Spirit of God and the Father and the Son, who substantially flows from both, namely from the Father through the Son. It would be foolish, therefore, to think that the Holy Spirit was changed into a soul, and passed into the nature of man. But that formed mass was animated by ineffable power, and immediately adorned with the gift of the Holy Spirit; for by no other means could we be endowed with the divine image.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> To this workmanship thus adorned, God granted the dwelling of paradise, in which to live. But because, since he was such, adorned man, and endowed with an abundance of heavenly goods, he would not easily be allowed to be drawn into arrogance, not recognizing that he was in a servile condition, and a certain measure is established for servants (for that excessive course towards glory and immoderate liberty draws one to haughtiness and an execrable vice), therefore a law of continence was given to him, so that he might have an occasion to recognize the Lord, and through it be always recalled to the memory of him who had set him over it by right of power, and might know for certain that he was subject to the laws of the ruler. But that impious and God-hated beast was not quiet.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You mean Satan, I think, who was cast down from the heavenly spheres like lightning.<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup> For he labored with such childish folly that he wished to be God, and in his madness imagined in his mind things which were above his nature.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You conjecture excellently. For since he was the inventor of envy and sin, he did not think he should cease from trying something against the earthly animal, that is, man. Then attacking him with deceit and arts, he drew him to disobedience, using the woman as an instrument of his cunning. For the pleasures which exist with us and in us always impel us to baseness, that is, to sin; and woman is a figure of pleasure; and the mind, allured by the blandishments of pleasures, frequently falls into that which it least willed. What therefore we see happened sensibly in Adam, as in a crasser image of things, this same thing we see fulfilled spiritually and hiddenly in each one of us. For pleasure, shining with its allurements, fascinates the mind, and leads it by degrees to think that the violation of the divine law is now of no importance at all. And that disciple of Christ confirms this when he says: "Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am being tempted by God,' for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death."<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> The account is accurate.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Having therefore bartered away the grace from God, and being now stripped of the goods which it had from the beginning, the nature of man was sent out from the paradise of delight, and was immediately transformed to baseness, and henceforth was shown to have fallen into corruption.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Necessarily indeed. For to be in want of the gifts from God is nothing else, I think, than to fall away from every good altogether. But easily, and very easily, the nature of man is carried away to any absurdities, unless the grace of the Savior sustains it in virtue, enriching it with the good things from above and from itself.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You speak well. For I would agree very reasonably; for the living bread, that is, the word of God, nourishes for spiritual strength. For it is written: "And bread strengthens man's heart."<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup> And it frees from servitude and passions, and gilds us well with the boasts of freedom. But if God has as it were withdrawn his hand, and does not distribute the supply of these things to us, by some necessity we fall into evils even against our will, and are destroyed from all virtue, and undergo as it were another yoke, and come to such evils and greed, that it is not far from also losing the very understanding which serves and is united to us for every kind of good, and being shown to be devoid of the wisdom according to God, and the heart of the sufferer to be utterly given over, as if prostituted to Satan, and easily subjected to his insolences and licentiousnesses.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Will you show how this happens, or will you allow our thoughts to float on mere words?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> By no means. For I will show, as well as possible, by skillfully forming into a type of intelligible things what happened to the ancients. For things which are as it were in sensation and as if in visible sight can become for us clear and most distinct images of things in subtle contemplation. It is written therefore concerning the patriarch Abraham: "Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land."<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> For leaving the land dear to him and fertile, he moved to another, which God had shown. "Go from your country," he says, "and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you."<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup> But the famine growing heavy, and bringing inevitable damage, he was forced, unwilling, to see Egypt; and he dwelt in it not as an inhabitant, but as a sojourner.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> To what then does this tend?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It sets before us for contemplation a most beautiful form of more secret things.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> In what way?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Rebuking the unbelief of the Jews, God says: "Behold, the days are coming," declares the Lord God, "when I will send a famine on the land—not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. They shall wander from sea to sea, and from north to east; they shall run to and fro, to seek the word of the Lord, but they shall not find it."<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup> But, my friend, those who are oppressed by this famine, and destitute of that supply from God which holds us in virtue when fallen, and lack that heavenly and supernal food, is it not altogether necessary for them to sojourn, and for their mind to become in a way an exile migrating henceforth to worse things, and driven from the fortress of virtue as from their own region, to descend to another habit and will, and to be subject no longer to the command of God, but to the scepters of the devil? For the parent and king of sin, I think, is he who first brought it into the world, whose figure and image not absurdly, I think, one may establish as that Pharaoh, the prince of the Egyptians, among whom were dense errors, darkness, and no kind of wickedness left untried.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And what trouble befell Abraham from his going down into Egypt?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The greatest indeed. For he was carried almost beyond all measure of evils. And you will easily learn this, Scripture saying: "When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house."<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> See therefore, Palladius, how little he was from losing his wife.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How harsh a chance, and grievous to bear!</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And yet this same thing happens spiritually in us ourselves. For those to whom it happens to be driven from honesty and virtue, which they have made their friend and familiar, as from their own country, and to descend to worse things, and to be subjected to diabolical scepters, are assailed on all sides and in all ways, and the wicked and adverse powers lay grave snares for them, and if they see any of those subject to them endowed with a beautiful and excellent intellect, they strive to claim him for their leader, and subject him to his lust, so that he may no longer serve God, but Satan. "For his food," as it is written, "is choice,"<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> and they strive to allure in a way the captive and lapsed soul, lest if it should perceive acutely, it might flee back from servitude to liberty. And so they conciliate to it sometimes pleasures in earthly things, and increase them with various delights, as those princes of the Egyptians also did, who, by flattering, by honors and gifts, desired to call Abraham away from his wife. It is written "They treated Abraham well because of her,"<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> without a doubt because of Sarah, "and there were sheep and oxen, and donkeys, and male servants and female servants, and mules and camels..." For Satan, by his deceit, entices us with temporal things, and in a way defrauds us of the seed of fertile freedom, and by tyrannical force subjects the nobility of the soul to lust and intemperance, and conquers us with the allurements of earthly things. Indeed, he sometimes burst forth into such madness that he did not fear to tempt even Christ himself. "And taking him," it says, "he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, and the devil said to him: 'To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. You therefore, if you will worship me, it will all be yours.'"<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> That is correct. But tell me, I beg you, what relief and what aid can exist for those who have fallen into these evils?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> God, Palladius, and his grace, which does not permit the weak soul to be entirely under the feet of the devil, but protects and liberates him who is in no way able to guard and defend himself. Moreover, you can see, if you wish, that this very thing happened to the patriarch Abraham: for when the just man despaired and could accomplish nothing by his own spirit, God intervened, who freed the woman from the intemperance of the Egyptians. "For the Lord afflicted Pharaoh with great and terrible afflictions, and his house because of Sarah, the wife of Abraham."<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup> Having done this, he at last dismissed the wife of the just man, scarcely free from injury. God, therefore, and indeed he alone, can easily snatch the captive soul from the hands of the devil and recall it to its original integrity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, the need of earthly goods sometimes drives us to shameful and execrable actions.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> I think so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> However, it seems fitting to the divine benignity not to permit us to fall into anything of this kind.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is fitting, and indeed most fitting to God, and he wills it so, Palladius; otherwise he would not be good, nor truly a lover of virtue, unless he were of this mind towards us. But that these things happen to us is our fault, who provoke the Lord of all to anger; by which act, he sends upon us a soul weak and lacking in strength. Do you not hear his voice, when through one of the holy prophets he cries out: "Behold, I am sending upon this people weakness; and in it parents and children together shall be weakened, neighbor and his friend shall perish"?<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup> The most wise Paul also writes concerning certain people: "And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind, to do what ought not to be done."<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup> Isaiah makes this same point more clearly, speaking as if from the person of the sons of Israel, namely those who had slipped into sins: "Behold, you are angry, and we have sinned."<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, I ask you, shall we, being sluggish and idle, departing from duty, and ensnared by sins, cast the blame upon God, and accuse his anger, as if we had sinned because of it?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Truly, tell me, should God be blamed by us? For that would be madness; but when we say: "You are angry, and we have sinned," we understand something like this: Unless we have you as favorable, O Lord, there is nothing to prevent us from being oppressed by the tyranny of sin, on account of the weakness of our nature, and thus at last we become involved in all evils.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I understand what you are saying.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, stripped of heavenly care and providence, and being affected by our excessive idleness and headlong propensity towards wickedness, we become weak and easily captured, and indeed, of what kind of evil are we not found to be suffering? It is easy for you to perceive this clearly by reading the words of Jeremiah. For the savage multitude of the Jews, although they were luxuriating very abundantly and flowing over in the greatest liberality of God, since they ruled over all their enemies and had finally reached the very highest peak of human glory, nevertheless meditated upon the hardest and most obstinate perfidy. And so, having almost bidden farewell to the commandments of Moses, and holding the sacred laws as utterly worthless, they were carried by headlong impulse to death and destruction. For under the oak, and the poplar, and the shade of a leafy tree, according to the voice of the prophet,<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup> they had built altars, and in the groves thick with trees, having established precincts for worshipping demons, they honored them with sacrifices of oxen and incense, and with every other kind of worship, not blushing to call their own handiwork gods and saviors, and by all such names. Indeed, they had even arrived at such folly at one time that they thought those impious slaughters of their children were a matter for boasting, and believed they were offering a rich victim to them by such a great crime. Nor indeed did the impiety of the sons of Israel stop within these bounds; but heaping crime upon crime, and carried headlong into every kind of absurdity, they provoked the anger of the lawgiver, however kind he was. Therefore, since they had most boldly rejected his service, he permitted them to be oppressed by enemies and led away to a necessary servitude, under which they were under the Chaldeans and Babylonians. When these, having left their own homes, had come to lead them away captive and to burn that holy and famous city, then at last it seemed good to those who were being attacked to consult the prophet Jeremiah as to what end this evil would have for them. "And Jeremiah said," it says, "Thus shall you say to Zedekiah: Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war which are in your hands, with which you are fighting against the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the wall, into the midst of this city. And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, in anger and in great wrath. And I will strike all the inhabitants of this city, both men and beasts, with a great pestilence, and they shall die."<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup> Then after some other things: "And to this people," it says, "you shall say: Thus says the Lord: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence, but he who goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall live, and his life shall be as a prize of war, and he shall live. For I have set my face against this city for evil and not for good, and it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire."<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup> Do you understand, therefore, that if by our misdeeds we offend God, it will come to pass that we wretches will be unable to resist the power of our enemies, but with the divine anger, as it were, attacking and leaping upon us, we shall be slaves instead of free men, and shall lead an ignoble and miserable life.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For the law of God leads the compliant man to a blameless way of life, and becomes like a lamp for each one, for the showing forth of what is useful and necessary; and he who is overcome with reverence for it will, I think, not live ignobly and, as it were, will dwell in a holy city, namely that one founded upon virtue and established in piety. But if indeed someone should choose to cast himself readily into worldly pleasures as into a certain thicket and flourishing, deep-wooded forest, and to linger in the delights of this life, and to admit multiform pleasure, like a swarm of idols, into his mind and heart, and to burn the fruits of his own eagerness as incense to demons; then indeed, and very rightly, he would slip from the heavenly protection, and would be exposed as a most ready prey for those wishing to capture him. Thrust out from the holy city of the good order he had in the beginning, he will henceforth dwell, as if by necessity, under a yoke, according to the will of those in power, and he will be far from God, according to the manner of his disposition, undergoing a deportation to Babylon, that is, beyond the boundaries of the holy land, in which God is known and his name is great.<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup> Therefore, those enduring such a harsh hardship, having fallen into the hands of enemies and not bearing their way of life as slavish and servile, cried out: "By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion."<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> For the human mind suffers, I think, from some such disease.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What do you mean by this?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is sluggish and supine, and generally desires the good things which are at hand, nor does it much seek those things which are in its own power. But if any inclination should be made to the other part, and it should happen to be diminished in the ornaments which it had, then at last, in its evils, it understands with difficulty that all strength must be resisted, and that room for insult should not have been given to the very end, lest it cast itself into danger.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is necessary, therefore, and full of wisdom, and in the first place most useful, to cut off the causes of evils, and to close the approach to forced servitude, and to avoid with the utmost diligence those things which, if it happens we experience them, we shall be involved in all evils.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> That is how the matter stands.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And if by the divine anger the yoke of necessary servitude is imposed upon us, so that we must descend into a debased mind, it will indeed not be easy to resist. Nevertheless, I would say that it is expedient even just to remember from what things into which we have declined, and to bitterly bewail both our own carelessness and the lack of heavenly aid towards us: "For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret."<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup> But if the divine anger does not threaten us, and it is free both to will and to do what seems good, and we are allowed to retain that propensity to either part, I mean to evil and to good, loose and free and alien from all coercion, we must strenuously beware of that languor in wickedness, and, unless I am mistaken, repel the pleasures offered by the enemy, and take care lest we be under the power of the enemies, who are said to be the rulers of this world; even if perhaps some portion of happiness is present to anyone, of that happiness, I say, which is considered great in this world, but which has an altogether shameful and disgraceful end.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> In what way, pray?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do you wish us to take examples from the ancients?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very much so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> When almost all the men who, to speak summarily, were everywhere in the lands were being consumed by famine, it seemed good to the sons of Jacob to go down into Egypt. They were young men, ten in number. The reason for which they undertook the journey was to buy food, and nothing else. Afterwards, when they had obtained this and were now recognized as brothers of Joseph, who was both selling the grain and was the prince of the land of Egypt, Pharaoh heard of the affair. "And Pharaoh said," it says, "to Joseph: Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your beasts and go to the land of Canaan, and taking your father and your belongings, come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land.' You also command them to do this, that they may take wagons from the land of Egypt for their little ones and their wives, and taking your father, come, and do not spare your eyes for your belongings, for all the best of Egypt shall be yours."<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup> Therefore, the ruler of the Egyptians promised them rest and pleasures most abundantly, and moreover gave them wagons, to entice them, I think, who were hesitant about the descent. They, with their whole household, immediately went down, preferring the temporary enjoyment of food—I know not by what reasoning—to the land and region given by God. For it was much better and more advantageous to procure sustenance from that land, although it could be accomplished not without some slight labor. But after they had come into Egypt, they thought perhaps they had now escaped the labors which they had at home, and the sensation of present pleasures was somehow sweet to them. But as time passed, that multitude, noble and free from its ancestors, underwent the harsh yoke of servitude. Therefore, if along with worldly prosperity there comes a falling into baser things, it must be rejected, my friend, if indeed we have any regard for freedom, and we must abhor and detest the servile thing and mindset.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You have spoken excellently.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> What, then, prevents us from also saying that, which seems to me to contain no moderate utility along with those things we have just said?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What is that?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The Rabshakeh, the Babylonian, the general of the Assyrians, had once gathered a multitude of guards beyond number, and had come to besiege, or rather, he had supposed he would take the entire holy city from its foundations without any trouble. Then, before he brandished his weapons, he shook out that blasphemy, much practiced and very customary for him against God; and saying many blasphemous things, he finally addressed those who inhabited the holy city: "Thus says the king of the Assyrians: If you wish to be blessed, come out to me, and let each one eat of his own vine and his own fig tree, and drink water from his own cistern, until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards."<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup> See, therefore, that he too promises delight and pleasure from the vine and fig tree. He added also, "Drink water from your own cistern."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But what would these things mean, if they are referred to spiritual contemplation?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> In two ways, I think, the power of wickedness is accomplished in us. For either by external pleasures, or by those innate and in us, we who are prone to sin, being persuaded to revel either by ourselves or even by others, are found to have slipped into all sorts of most base things. And that disciple of the Savior will show us that this is true, speaking thus: "For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life."<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup> For the desire of the flesh is innate and fixed in us and inherent, and the blessed Paul also calls it the law of sin,<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup> dwelling in the members of the flesh. The external and adventitious pleasures and delights are those which are perceived by the senses of the eyes. For through the eyes men admire riches, and also the splendor of clothing and other things of that kind, which some, being addicted to them, vehemently approve, as if their use were most pleasant. Therefore, the vine and the fig tree not absurdly hold the figure of that external and adventitious delight and pleasure, and at the same time they not inelegantly show the brief and fleeting nature of things which are in the world, and the sweetness joined with that force which intoxicates the head and pours darkness upon it. For all worldly pleasure has a sweet perception of itself for the present; but it blinds the one enjoying it and inebriates him grievously. The cistern, moreover, is a figure of the innate motions in us; for these are not adventitious like those, but flow in us as from a fountain, since they gush forth from our very flesh. Therefore, those most wicked powers say that the free perception of all these natural and adventitious pleasures, and the most abundant delight, will be ours if, having left continence, as it were the holy and most firm city, we should betake ourselves to the king of Babylon, who is a figure of Satan. Therefore, the Rabshakeh promised to indulge them with present pleasure and that he would add it if they defected to the Babylonians; but they, since they were wise, did not at all allow themselves to be persuaded. For he who willingly follows after worldly pleasures must, whether he will or not, fall into servitude and be counted in the number of captives.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak the truth. But I would like this said to me: how can we be snatched from such great evils?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> In what other way than by that contrary to the first? For when by the impulses of our own wills we were inclined to live shamefully, and had cast away that perfect elegance of life, we fell down into an ignoble and servile mind, since we were wise only in the things which are on earth, and were intent upon the pleasures of the flesh in every way. Therefore, God permitted us to fall into a debased mind.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, we must return to virtue by a contrary course?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And indeed without any delay, Palladius, so that we may consider that this worldly life is not to be desired, according to that saying of Paul, nobly spoken: "For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God."<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup> But rather let us burn with that desire that our name may be written in heaven, and let us esteem our fatherland and city to be that heavenly one, and let us cry out to God: "Relieve me, for I am a sojourner on the earth, and a stranger, as all my fathers were."<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup> For he who walks on the earth but has his citizenship in heaven,<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup> is clearly proved from the very things to be a sojourner and stranger. Therefore, the disciple of our Savior commands us to consider this as noble and glorious, in these words: "Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul."<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup></p>
      <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Is it enough for achieving virtue to be thus affected, that is, to have ceased from carnal desires?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Only if those things which pertain to that other probity of character, namely the spiritual, are also wisely added. For it is written: "Your commandment is exceedingly broad."<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup> What? Is there not a double defilement in us, of the soul, I say, and of the body? Therefore, I think it most just that things which have the power of cleansing should succeed, equal and corresponding to those things which are wont to defile.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, just as the stain is double, of soul and body, so also it is most fitting that the purification be one of the soul, another of the body. Moreover, that this very thing, namely to consider the present life as a sojourning, is not useless for those who are thus affected, can very easily be seen, if it pleases anyone to look upon the image of this thing in Abraham, to whom it was said by God: "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup> Do you understand, therefore, that he commanded him to depart not only from his land and house, but also from his kindred, and indeed from his father's house, and to go into the land which he who was calling would show him?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But what does this mean?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Surely, when God calls us to follow him, without a doubt it is spiritually; and since he wishes those whom it has pleased him to honor to come out from the worldly life, that is, the life of pleasure and given over to the desires of the flesh, can it be denied that it is clearly most foolish to think that anything is to be preferred to so great a matter? Indeed, let fatherland, family, father's house, and even the possession of earthly things themselves be regarded as nothing. Therefore, the Savior himself also called us to a similar fortitude of soul, saying: "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me."<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup> He also added that: "And everyone who has left brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands or houses for my name's sake will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life."<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup> What? Do you not confess that the highest fortitude, that which is in Christ, is needed, which holds these things as nothing, and esteems it of great value to follow Christ?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Certainly, since even those who were called to the marriage feast, but refused to come, slipped away from the best hope and from the joy in Christ. One of them said, "I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come."<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup> Another, saying he had bought a field, preferred temporal things to the calling.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Well done, Palladius. For you gladden us by saying things consistent with the truth, and by your excellent understanding you run ahead to grasp the end of our discourse fervently. See, therefore, that those who follow God wholly and perfectly, and have made the hope in him their own, putting carnal things and worldly pleasure second, will altogether obtain to receive the heavenly blessing abundantly. For what does he say to Abraham? "I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you," and the things that follow.<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup> You see, therefore, with what an abundance of spiritual goods he loaded him? Now, in what manner Abraham departed from his native soil, is it not worthy to see? "He took," it says, "Sarah his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions that they had acquired, and the persons that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. And Abraham passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh."<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup> He departed from Haran, leaving no remnant of his own there, but with all his race, as it were, and his whole household, with the greatest eagerness he hastened to the land of Canaan, which God had shown. Then he passed through the land to its length, and came to the lofty land. For whoever has decided to obey the divine precepts very closely, and to deem the heavenly calling worthy of the best care, let him go out from the life in worldly pleasures, wholly and entirely, and as it were with all his race, leaving no remnant of his own mind in the place where he once was. For thus he will depart rightly, and will pass through the land to which he has been called by God, so that, as the blessed Paul writes, he may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth of the mystery of Christ.<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup> For then he will rightly ascend to the lofty land, that is, to the habit which is set on high in virtues, and no longer has any part inclined and prone to the love of the flesh. And what good will come to him who has arrived at this, we shall learn from the sacred Scriptures themselves. "The Lord appeared to Abraham," it says, "and said to him: 'To your offspring I will give this land.' And Abraham built there an altar to the Lord who had appeared to him."<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup> For while he was still lingering in his native land and had not yet removed to the holy land, the only response given was that he must migrate to another region, having disregarded his native soil. But when he came to the land of Canaan with all his household and all his goods, and ascended to the holy land, then indeed the grace of the divine vision was granted to him, and his hope was strengthened by the promise, and the power to build an altar was now given. And we too, in like manner, as long as we remain in the world and adhere to its external pleasures, have no permanent grace from God; but if, being called, we obey the divine laws, and with eager zeal ascend, as to a lofty land, to the seeking of all good things, then indeed God promises to send upon us the knowledge of his glory and the confirmation of hope, and he sends such strength into our minds that we can now offer spiritual sacrifices,<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup> and be a pleasing aroma to God and the Father, as it is written;<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup> to present our very bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God,<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup> that is, that rational and spiritual worship which is most acceptable to God. For he willingly embraces the rite of that spiritual service and considers it a spiritual sacrifice.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is fitting, therefore, that having departed from baser deeds, we should betake ourselves to a better life, and most willingly embrace the heavenly calling, and desire to be most occupied in those things which are approved by the law and judged best by God. For to wish to turn back and return to those things from which we have departed is by no means free from fault.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> By no means, Palladius. For it is most dangerous to wish to fall back into those diseases from which you have once escaped. For those who have once been snatched by God's help from worldly conversation, it is by no means safe even just to look back at them, and to recall their sins in memory, and to apply their mind to loving them. Therefore, that divine Psalmist prayed, saying: "Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things."<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup> For vanity, indeed, is the distraction of this life and the vain delight in temporal things, from which it is necessary to be separated and to withdraw, and the very consideration of them, even in thought alone, joined with pleasure, must be avoided by him who wishes to walk rightly, as can easily be understood from this.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> From what, I ask?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The inhabitants of Sodom, when they were violently driven, as by some star, to those pleasures which were contrary to nature, and, having despised the law of intercourse which nature itself prescribed for the procreation of children, were excited to lusts, allured by the beauty of males, and there was no crime so heinous from which they abstained, provoked the anger of God, and compelled the Creator, otherwise kind, to descend, as it were, to exact punishment from them. Therefore, when the time of paying the penalty was at hand, the divine patience in them being now, as it were, exhausted, the ministers of divine vengeance entered Sodom. For so it is written: "The two angels came to Sodom in the evening. Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth and said, 'My lords, please turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way.' They said, 'No; we will spend the night in the town square.' But he pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate before they lay down..."<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup> For Lot, since he was from the seed of Abraham and educated in the right laws and vehemently devoted to piety towards God, dwelt in Sodom. But he was among them as a sojourner and stranger, both in race and in morals. "For what partnership has light with darkness? Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever?"<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup> as it is written. Therefore, since he despised the vices of the natives, and walked in that way of life to which he was accustomed, he clung to holy studies, and since he especially cultivated the law of hospitality, sitting at the very entrance of the city, he kindly received those entering; for he judged this to be pleasing to God. When those had come who were about to inflict punishment upon the men raging with unbridled lust (these were the angels), he ran to them and shows them a most evident proof of his kindness in that he greeted them. For he bowed himself with his face to the earth; and he urges them to go to his house and enjoy the laws of charity. But they said, "Not so, we will spend the night in the square." By these words they signified that they were strangers and without a roof; but at the same time they were inciting the man, studious of hospitality, to a greater, I think, effort of zeal, and almost urbanely hinting that it would not be honorable for him if he let them, excluded from roofs and cast out in the streets, depart: which when that just man understood, he began to urge them more vehemently; and not as if he were inviting them coldly and half-heartedly, he seized upon their excuse as an opportunity. Therefore, he leads them to his house, set out unleavened bread, prepared a feast. And these things indeed the just man did. But the Sodomites, since they were laboring under an open and shameful disease of pleasure, wickedly surrounded the little house of the pious man, and, having gone beyond all bounds of impudence, they contended that the accustomed use of lust should be granted to them; and upon those to whom they ought to have offered the duties of hospitality, they wished to exercise lust contrary to nature. Moreover, they wanted to offer violence to Lot himself, when he tried to turn them away from such monstrous and foul attempts, and they were close to doing violence, had not the preservers intervened. "For the men," it says, "reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door. And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door."<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup> Nor indeed was the aid which stood within this measure; for again it is written: "But when morning came, the angels urged Lot, saying: 'Take your wife and your two daughters whom you have, lest you also perish in the iniquities of the city.' And they were troubled, and the angels took hold of his hand, and the hand of his wife, and the hands of his two daughters, because the Lord spared him."<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup> Moreover, this can be shown by a most evident argument, that we are incited to withdraw from sins not only by words and admonitions sent into the soul, but also by the Savior God descending to that kindness towards us, so that he helps us with effective aid, according to that saying: "You held my right hand, and in your will you led me."<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup> For because human nature is not very firm, nor has sufficient strength to emerge from evils, God brings help to it in this matter. And so he is known to bestow a double grace: for when he persuades, then he also finds reasons for helping, and makes them stronger than the present evil and its force attacking us. Moreover, it can easily be seen that it is true that there are very few who are zealous for justice, and there is a great scarcity of good men in this life: for "a faithful man," as it is written, "is hard to find."<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup> Nevertheless, such a man is chosen and deemed worthy of no small divine care and providence. For although in this life he is mixed among the lots, yet he suffers no harm from it, but is plucked like a lily from thorns, nor is it right for a just man to perish with the impious, as the holy men testify.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, by the kindness of God and the help of the holy angels, we shall shake off the dominion of wickedness, and also without doubt we shall attain this, that we may never at all be involved in the labors of wicked men, relying on God, who openly proclaims by the voice of a certain prophet: "I am the Lord your God, who hold your right hand, who say to you, 'Do not fear, Jacob, little Israel, I have helped you,' says the Lord, who redeemed you, Israel."<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup></p>
       <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Is it not sufficiently shown that God Almighty is the helper of holy men, in that Lot was taken by the hand of the angels? For those angels not absurdly hold the figure of God, since three first came to Abraham at the oak of Mamre, and two again came against Sodom. "For the Father judges no one," according to the voice of our Savior, "but has given all judgment to the Son"<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup>: with whom without doubt the Holy Spirit is present together and naturally inheres.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You understand rightly. But, if it pleases, let us consider the things that follow.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> I delay nothing, and I will now speak. "And it came to pass," it says, "after they brought him out, they said: 'Save your soul; do not look back, nor stand in all the surrounding region; save yourself on the mountain, lest perhaps you be seized together.'"<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup> In those words, therefore, "Save your soul," I think that this is manifestly said: "Keep yourself chaste, and do not share in the sins of others."<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup> And be superior to the hindrances which the world brings; for the whole world is no exchange for the soul. "For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, but suffers the loss of his own soul?"<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup> Moreover, that he says that he must walk so as not to turn himself back, that perhaps signifies that we must beware, lest while we turn ourselves to wickedness, we begin again to feel the same as those who have fallen into the punishment of fire on account of intemperance. "For no one," he says, "who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of heaven."<sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup> For the way of salvation must be held, not turning this way and that, and a light and fickle mind must not be driven to vain images of worldly desires; but a sound and vigilant mind, and one which always takes care to look straight ahead, must be preserved in ourselves. Moreover, I will say what is greater: for the angel said that not only must he walk so as not to turn back, but he also opportunely added: "Do not stand in all the surrounding region. Save yourself on the mountain, lest perhaps you be seized together."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But what does that mean, "Do not stand in all the surrounding region?"</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> That sluggishness and inertia in leaping away from evil, I think, is slippery and dangerous.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> In what way, tell me, I beg you.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For the prophetic word says: "Woe to those who do the work of the Lord negligently."<sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup> — "Run so that you may obtain,"<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup> the blessed Paul also says somewhere. For not to wish to flee vigorously and earnestly from baser things, since the mind is hard to tear away from old things and departs as if reluctantly from each evil and very sluggishly applies itself to what is naturally beneficial, is nothing else than to stand in the neighboring region of wickedness, from which one ought to depart swiftly. For it can happen that before we have gone beyond the boundaries of vice, while we always delay and hesitate, the divine vengeance may seize us, before we have cleansed the stain, before we have washed away the taint of ancient sloth infused into the soul, before we have shaken off the burden of crimes from ourselves, and have taken up that salutary yoke, and have found rest through Christ. Therefore, the best exhortation is, "Do not stand in all the surrounding region," that is, beware lest you be found delaying in any kind of wickedness, but ascend as if to a mountain, namely to an outstanding and remarkable life, which has nothing low and abject, but excels in lofty and sublime virtue, and is alien from a lowly, earthly, and carnal mindset. For it is written: "The mighty ones of God have been greatly exalted from the earth."<sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup> For that which is holy is highest of earthly things. "And the young vultures fly high,"<sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup> according to what is written, if indeed they have their citizenship in heaven as if on a mountain,<sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup> and claim a homeland above. And Paul also writes somewhere: "Seek the things that are above, not the things that are on earth."<sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, the mountain is the spiritual life in holiness, and the excellence of the outstanding way of life, while the life in impurities and loving to sin, and clinging to earthly things, is understood as low.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You have spoken well; for our discourse makes this very clear to us. And you will wonder at this also.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What is that?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For the blessed angel said that the divine Lot, running without delay and without turning back, must leap up to the mountain. But he begged, saying: "I beg you, Lord, since your servant has found mercy before you, and you have magnified your righteousness, which you do to keep my soul alive; but I cannot be saved in the mountain, lest the evils overtake me and I die. Behold, this city is near for me to flee to, which is small, there I shall be saved. Is it not small, and will my soul live?" And he said to him, it says: "Behold, I have respected you also in this matter, not to overthrow the city of which you have spoken. Hurry therefore to be saved there, for I can do nothing until you enter there." Therefore he called the name of that city Zoar. The sun had risen upon the earth, and Lot entered Zoar."<sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And what benefit can come to us from these words, I would wish, as you well know, to learn.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do you not understand, although you are inclined to learning, that for those who have just run out of wickedness, and think they must proceed on the way of salvation, virtue is not easily captured and accessible straightaway, nor even from first attempts? But one cannot easily be brought back to an exalted way of life, nor can one become far from the passions which have somehow grown up with him, but he will be outside such things gradually, at least as far as eagerness for better things and the beginnings of attempts are concerned; but he will not be very high, or far off; but he will almost migrate to another land, as it were, to a life indeed praiseworthy, but not yet having a lofty and conspicuous glory—such as was the instruction under the Law, leading to the beginnings of the best and good life. For it is written: "The beginning of a good way is to do just things."<sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup> For just as for those who are zealous for knowledge and desire the contemplation of the mystery, the word of catechesis is suitable in the beginning and most fitting, but for those who are already advancing to perfect manhood and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,<sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup> the solid food, that is, the explanation of the highest things, and every way and method of dogmatic investigation must be opened: so also in this part, that is, in correcting morals, it is not right for anyone to ascend at the first attempt to the state free from all blame, that is, to the admirable and sublime way of life. But he can proceed gradually to a habit perfect in all respects, if he begins from small and moderate things, and progresses, as it were, to a small city near the high mountain, namely to that way of life which is subject to a superior and sublime life and is inferior. In this way, the just Lot, who begged to be allowed to turn aside not immediately to the mountain but to the small city Zoar, not absurdly becomes a figure of those who are thus affected. For do we not find that such moderation towards the faithful is often observed even in the preaching of the Gospel? The blessed Paul certainly writes in the Epistle: "It is good for a man not to touch a woman. But because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. But this I say by way of concession, not of command. For I wish that all men were as I myself am. But each has his own gift from God, one in this way, another in that."<sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup> You see how he has shown the highest grade of continence as a mountain to us, saying, "It is good for a man not to touch a woman," yet he permitted turning aside to Zoar, that is, to a way of life still subject to perfect virtue, allowing, I say, each to be united with his own wife alone. The Savior also said that the good earth yields fruit,<sup><a href="#fn92" id="ref92">92</a></sup> one a hundredfold, another sixty, another thirty. He also distributed the talent not in equal measure, but to one five, to another two, to another one.<sup><a href="#fn93" id="ref93">93</a></sup> By these examples he indicates that he gives gifts to individuals according to each one's capacity and ability. For as we just said: "Each has his own gift from God, one in this way, another in that."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, the blessed angel permits him to turn aside to Zoar. "For behold," he says, "I have respected you also in this matter, not to overthrow the city of which you have spoken. Hurry therefore to be saved there." Then it says, "The sun had risen upon the earth, and Lot entered Zoar." And you will wonder no less, Palladius, when you learn what the meaning of the words is: "For I have respected you," he says, "not to overthrow the city of which you have spoken." For that way of life which does not perfectly compose itself to virtue is truly hateful to God; and this very thing, to yield even in the smallest part to vices, seems to him to be rejected and not far from condemnation. But he indulges by his kindness, and shows that the capacity for beginnings is equal to the strength of nature, and that he distributes gifts to individuals according to each one's capacity and ability. For as we just said: "Each has his own gift from God, one in this way, another in that." By this indulgence, as it were, he commands that even those who are still meditating on virtue, but do not walk in that way of life which is far removed from blame, be saved. But also for those who strive for this grade of virtue and are advanced to such a state, it happens that they enter there not without divine light and the preceding brightness of the heavenly lamp. "For the sun had risen," it says, "and Lot entered Zoar."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How these things which you have said agree!</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, the blessed Lot entered a still small city, by God's permission: but the wife who accompanied him and fled with him was found to be weak also in this. "For she looked back," it says, "and became a pillar of salt."<sup><a href="#fn94" id="ref94">94</a></sup> Observe, therefore, the manly and strenuous mind, when it undertakes virtue, even if it does not fully attain what pleases God, yet it certainly departs from vices and gradually progresses to better things: but the weak and less manly mind, whose figure is the woman when she turns to wickedness, becomes utterly useless: for I think that becoming a pillar of salt signifies this, that it not absurdly becomes a symbol of a mind grown dull and stupid, and a soul that has wished to pass into folly, and has at last reached utter stupor. For salt that has lost its savor is good for nothing, and the Savior himself says it is thrown out and made to be trodden under foot by men.<sup><a href="#fn95" id="ref95">95</a></sup> When, therefore, the woman had been hardened into stone, not long after Lot added what was lacking. For it is written: "Lot went up from Zoar and lived in the mountain, he and his two daughters with him. For he was afraid to live in Zoar, and he lived in a cave, he and his two daughters with him."<sup><a href="#fn96" id="ref96">96</a></sup> For the mind progresses as if by steps to the perfection of virtue, and gradually ascends to that state to which it had been unfit and weak at the beginning; it proceeds and is promoted to better things, supported by prudence and spiritual fortitude as by its certain daughters, and leaving that pleasure-loving and effeminate affection, whose figure is the woman, below. Then it lives as if on a mountain and in a cave. And the mountain indeed signifies well the height and eminence of spiritual strength, and the cave a fixed and firm perseverance in virtue. For thus it is written concerning good men: "He who walks in righteousness and speaks the straight way; who hates injustice and iniquity, and shakes his hands from gifts; who stops his ears from hearing the judgment of blood, and shuts his eyes from seeing iniquity: he will live in a high cave of solid rock."<sup><a href="#fn97" id="ref97">97</a></sup> Moreover, another not absurd exposition of this passage can be brought forward by us. For the rock is Christ,<sup><a href="#fn98" id="ref98">98</a></sup> on account of that firm and invincible nature of all substances. Furthermore, that cave can be understood in Christ as the Church, namely that dwelling of holy men and shelter of the pious, in which just men live, and whoever escape the punishment of fire.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How excellently this exposition seems to me! But I would wish you to handle the present passage with very many other proofs. For I would greatly value fully knowing what is useful.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But indeed, Palladius, you speak fittingly. For that matter, I think, is the fruit of a very studious mind, and my speech will overcome all sloth, since it does not seem right to me to maintain silence, if it has crept in untimely, in such illustrious and pleasant discourses. Therefore, we can contemplate without any trouble that we ought to be, in every way and by all means, as far as possible, separated from the affection and society of vicious things; and indeed that we cannot otherwise happen to return to virtue than by this very mode which we have mentioned, if we cast the eyes of our mind both on the things which happened to the blessed Abraham and on the more admirable outcome of the sons of Israel than can be expressed in words, when in their times they went out from the effective bonds of the Egyptian dominion.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Proceed, therefore, with the details; for know that you will bring us the greatest pleasure if you undertake to do this.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> We were saying, therefore, that the blessed Abraham, when he was once pressed by an intolerable famine and lack of necessities, did not descend to the Egyptians willingly, but yielded to necessity. This guest and stranger Pharaoh vexed with many troubles and injuries. For he wished to violate his wife, inflamed with intemperate lust to most shameful Egyptian desire. But God did not permit him to accomplish this. For "he scourged Pharaoh," it says, "with great scourges because of Sarah, the wife of Abraham..."<sup><a href="#fn99" id="ref99">99</a></sup> Now Pharaoh is a figure and image of the devilish intemperate one; for he strives for this and exerts all zeal to pour the seeds of impurity into the minds of holy men, so that they may produce the desired and pleasant fruits; and these are, I think, the crimes of various and diverse sins. And indeed, no one would not be captured by his force and injury and yield unwillingly (for our nature labors with weakness of strength), unless God did not permit it at all and restrained those attempts against holy men and the snares of that malignant one. But it would not have happened by any other means for the blessed Abraham to avoid those troubles unless, having left the region of the Egyptians, he had returned to that ancient place given by divine gift. When he arrived there, free from all care, he devoted himself to the best studies. For thus it is related: "Abraham went up from Egypt, he and his wife, and all that was his, and Lot with him, into the desert. Now Abraham was very rich in livestock, gold, and silver. And he went by the way he had come into the desert as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been before, between Bethel and Ai, to the place of the altar which he had made there before, and there Abraham called on the name of the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn100" id="ref100">100</a></sup> You understand, therefore, that for those who return from secular intemperance to the other life, all things must be taken away at once. For with his whole family, and his whole kindred, I will also add, with all his household goods, the patriarch Abraham migrated from the region of the Egyptians. For it is necessary to depart in every way and to migrate, as it were with the whole family, into the desert, that is, to the undisturbed and tranquil state of mind, from which human nature departed at the beginning, when for lack of higher goods it declined to worse things: for that descent to foreign nations signifies this by an enigma, from that ancient and most pleasant land in which there was also an altar: for in this way, returning until we come to the place and region of his altar, which was from the beginning, that is, of that ancient and innate holiness, we ourselves also call upon the God of all things, saying those prophetic words: "Lord, we know no other besides you, your name we call upon."<sup><a href="#fn101" id="ref101">101</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You have spoken most elegantly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And you will easily understand that this is not otherwise, if you diligently examine what also happened to the sons of Israel in their times: whom when the Egyptians had captured, compelled by famine from the beginning, and had subjected men from the very origin of their ancestors, sprung from the stock of saints and free, to unexpected and unaccustomed servitude, they treated them savagely and violently, having fabricated this occasion for their cruelty against them. "For a new king arose in Egypt," it says, "who did not know Joseph, who said to his people: 'Behold, the race of the sons of Israel is numerous and mighty beyond us. Come, let us deal craftily with them, lest they multiply; and when war befalls us, they also may join our enemies, and having overcome us, go out from the land.'"<sup><a href="#fn102" id="ref102">102</a></sup> For it vexed, I think, the prince of the land of the Egyptians, that those who had been subjected by a necessary and unexpected bond should at some time look back to freedom. "And he set," it says, "taskmasters over them, to afflict them with works; and they built fortified cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses, and On, which is Heliopolis."<sup><a href="#fn103" id="ref103">103</a></sup> For these were the fruits of that unbearable dominion, namely vexations and continual hardships in mud and brickmaking, also cities surrounded with walls and towers, and the construction of mounds in the fields. And they performed these works laboring without any pay and with much sweat. For the princes of this world, when they have taken the unhappy souls of men under their power, force them to lead a life full of bitterness and all troubles, distracted and bound to laborious and useless occupations (for such seem the works of the flesh and those which are done concerning it), which bring no utility at all to those who are forced to engage in such works. For what do the works of the flesh and vices profit our miserable soul? And a kind of profit will pertain to the devil and demons, and the wealth and glory will be for the kingdom of the adversaries, just as it was also no small glory for Pharaoh, as he thought, that cities were built for him by the sons of Israel, who undertook that labor with no food or pay provided.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> So the matter stands. For your discourse is very evident.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, the labor of the Israelites depicts for us the form and image, as it were, of our vain and profane pursuits on earth, when Satan and his most wicked companion powers, whom the divine Scripture signifies by the name of taskmasters, are present and imminent. These pursuits I would call a most distracting and busy occupation, full of sweat and labor, and filled as if with the mud of impurity and filthy pleasure. But then also God had mercy on those who were vexed by the unjust dominion of the Egyptians with utmost impiety and savagery, and served them contrary to all right and law. For immediately he chose Moses, an excellent man, as the minister of his kindness towards them. What? Do we not find that God does this very thing for us? For he bestows mercy on us who have fallen into sins, and immediately inserts his law into the hearts of all, which as a certain mediator calls us back to a free life.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I understand what you are saying.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do you wish, therefore, that, the history being briefly comprehended, we may say fitting things as far as possible?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very much so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Thus, therefore, it is written: "After these things, Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh; and they said to him: 'Thus says the Lord God of Israel: Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the desert.' And Pharaoh said: 'Who is he, that I should hear his voice, to let the sons of Israel go? I do not know the Lord, and I will not let Israel go.'"<sup><a href="#fn104" id="ref104">104</a></sup> For Moses and Aaron affirmed that the people of Israel ought to be let go from the region and land of the Egyptians, God calling them to hold a feast. For a feast is truly to shake off the yoke of coerced servitude from oneself, and to be in the power of God thereafter, and to carry out things pleasing to him, with no one opposing; that is, with no one compelling to undertake and accomplish what seems good to oneself. But Pharaoh uses excessive license of tongue and is borne with audacious temerity against the glory of God, and denies that he knows the Lord, who he is, and that he will allow Israel to be let go. But the blessed Moses did not desist at all, and boldly affirmed that the will of God ought to be accomplished. For when Satan hinders those who are in his power from striving to recover liberty, it is necessary for the men to make the journey and overcome all obstacles, and not to seem at all timid, but rather to stand firm, saying: "The God of the Hebrews has called us. We will go, therefore, a three days' journey into the desert, that we may sacrifice to our God, lest perhaps death or slaughter meet us."<sup><a href="#fn105" id="ref105">105</a></sup> For the wise man Moses was saying these words to us then also without contentiousness of voice. For he says, Not as you, O Egyptians, do we Hebrews worship a calf, nor a pig or goat, nor the shadowed form of a man, nor the images of birds and animals, nor the figures of reptiles, which are placed in your temples. But God and the Lord, who fashioned this universe, has called us. And he is great, and not to be reckoned with the gods of the Egyptians, but above all creation, the God of the Hebrews, who calls us into the desert, that we may offer a pleasing sacrifice to him there. And Egypt is indeed called darkness. But I think it is right that we who are spiritual understand spiritually the things which were done in shadow and figures. For it is necessary for us to depart far from everything that is wont to pour forth darkness; and when we have gone out from that facility of sinning, as from a certain region which is under the power of the tyrant, namely Satan, then to strive vigorously towards that free and purer life, and to walk by the way of lawful conduct, not subject to demons; then at last we will be able to offer to God the fruits of justice. Moreover, Moses affirmed that a journey of three days must be made by the Israelites: by which words he signified that it is necessary to be far from the boundaries of wickedness, and from that life which is pressed down by unjust dominion. Moreover, the blessed Moses uses a certain pretext of wisdom, and a very reasonable cause, saying that those who are called by God ought to withdraw from Egypt: "Lest perhaps," he says, "death or slaughter meet us."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But what is this? For it is not easy for those who desire to know to understand this.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> I will explain. A custom had grown strong among the Egyptians, which is still kept among idol worshippers, that those going to temples avoid meeting a corpse. For they say that it is the greatest impurity not only to touch it willingly, but even to happen upon the sight of it. Therefore, from the customs received among them, he persuades that they cannot sacrifice purely if, when they have begun to do this, a corpse or slaughter should meet them unexpectedly from elsewhere, that is, either one dead by the law of nature, or killed by murderers through violence. For to you, he says, there are sacred shrines and temples, fortified with enclosures and gates, within which, when you have entered, it will be permitted to sacrifice chastely, as you yourselves think; but we, sacrificing in the middle of the city and in crossroads and in fields, are necessarily polluted by the sight of corpses; for there is nothing at all that can restrain the sight. And the account of the simple history has probability from the customs of the Egyptians. But we will find the words of the most wise man no less rightly said if they are understood spiritually. For it is necessary for us to sacrifice as if in the desert, and to celebrate a holy feast to God, going out from the land of the Egyptians; moreover, the sight of death must be avoided; for with a mind at leisure and far removed from the darkness which the world pours, and with eyes averted from those things which lead to death and corruption, thus at last we will sacrifice chastely to God the ruler of all. For dead works are the works of the flesh; but worldly darkness is that disturbance and confusion from laborious and useless cares and distractions, which pollutes the pure and clear ether of the mind; from which it is necessary to withdraw for those who wish to worship God sincerely, as the words of the history also persuade us.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> This is indeed not at all obscure; and therefore I would wish you to pursue those things which follow next.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, a most ardent and sharp desire for ancient liberty, I think, had seized the Israelites: and when they aspired to it vehemently, they stirred up the wrath of him who had imposed the yoke of servitude on them. And since he said that the desire for such things came from leisure, he ordered the sweat and labor of their works to be increased for them. And so, so that the sum of the customary work might be exacted from them without any delay, but the provision of straw might be denied contrary to custom, he imposed it; for he said: "You are at leisure, you are idle, therefore you say, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.' Now therefore go, work; for straw will not be given, and you will give the sum of the brickwork." And the scribes of the sons of Israel saw that they were in trouble, saying: "You shall not diminish the set amount of bricks for each day." And they met Moses and Aaron coming to meet them, as they were coming out from Pharaoh, and said to them: "May the Lord look upon you and judge, because you have made our odor abominable before Pharaoh and before his servants, so as to put a sword in his hand to kill us."<sup><a href="#fn106" id="ref106">106</a></sup> For, O friend, will you not say that it is most true, when someone begins to shake off the yoke of the devil's dominion, and to take up the splendid and free glory of divine worship, and to be at leisure and to know him who is truly the Lord, as is sung in the Psalms: "Be at leisure and know that I am God"<sup><a href="#fn107" id="ref107">107</a></sup>, then he will challenge the leisure and zeal in such business as a kind of impiety. But let us not attribute it to our fault, and let him, together with other wicked and impure spirits, that enemy of all, rise up against us, and fiercely compel us, so that by carnal and earthly impurity, and the cares and distractions of the world, according to each one's habit, we might firmly cling to them, and by no means abstain from the wickedness in which we have long been involved; indeed, he makes that very thing scarcely to be hoped for by us, lest the vice, since it is readily at hand, be despised, and he create a satiety of itself? For I think this signifies that they fiercely demanded the making of bricks; moreover, the things by which they could easily be made, that is, the straw, were withdrawn. For it is somehow in our nature, that we seek those things to which we are accustomed with the greatest eagerness and contention, and burn with a more ardent desire for them, when something intervenes which by a certain force draws us away from obtaining them. Therefore, when the divine law teaches the human mind to unlearn base things, then a certain great desire arises, which calls it back to them, and almost makes it cry out against the lawgiver himself: of which matter we have an example in the shadows, as it were, in the Scribes of the sons of Israel, who were then both worn out by the labor of the works, and saw no easy way to complete them; for they were in want of straw: and they also blamed Moses and Aaron heavily, saying that they had provided the occasion for their vexation, and that they were suffering a more grievous injury for no other reason than this one, that a desire for recovering liberty had seized them, from which they had given credence to their words:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What do you think about these things?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is entirely so, Palladius. For as soon as a laudable desire and right thought has aroused us, perhaps to embrace the things that please God, and we remember the law which exhorts us to piety, that common enemy of all impels us worse to the things that harm. But God snatches us from there and sets us free; and so He said to Moses: "Go, say to the sons of Israel: I am the Lord; and I will bring you out from the power of the Egyptians, and I will free you from their servitude, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and great judgment, and I will take you as a people for myself, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the power of the Egyptians."<sup><a href="#fn108" id="ref108">108</a></sup> For when Satan discourages and turns us away from every good desire, and by whatever means he can, repels us from our inclination towards good; on the contrary, the law of God exhorts to good will; and showing that He who helps us is invincible, it arouses us to daring with the fullest hope, and adds the sinews of faith, and dedicates us to God as to the true savior and liberator.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How good and salutary a thing is faith, and a burning desire to follow God!</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You speak rightly. Moreover, that faith tends towards perfect virtue as to its end, you will then know, when our discourse reaches the point to which it specially tends. For when Moses and his companions came to Pharaoh, to treat with him again, and to persuade him to release Israel from the land of captivity, and to loose them from their ancient bonds, they wished to sway him with signs, admirable beyond what can be said; for they showed the rod changed into a serpent, and they openly professed that they could easily perform far greater and more excellent things by God's help. But he commanded his Magicians to do similar things, crying out in this manner: "We are not ignorant of such works, and there are far more among the Egyptians who profess these things than among you; and the art and study of the Magicians is to produce these miracles, in whose number you also are." Therefore, when he was hardened to such a degree, and would not let the sons of Israel go, four plagues were inflicted upon him, one worse than the other: for the waters were wonderfully changed into blood, and frogs, and gnats, and finally dog-flies with unbearable force rendered Pharaoh more compliant. And so when he had summoned Moses, he said: "Go, sacrifice to the Lord your God in the land." And Moses said: "It cannot be so; for we shall sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians to the Lord our God. For if we sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians before their very eyes, we shall be stoned. We will go a three days' journey into the wilderness, and we will sacrifice to the Lord our God, as he has commanded us." And Pharaoh said: "I will let you go, and you shall sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness; but do not go far away..."<sup><a href="#fn109" id="ref109">109</a></sup> For when Satan resists, and bravely opposes his wickedness to the alacrity of our souls, by which we are raised to virtue, God rises up against him, and breaks his audacious assaults, and softens him with plagues. But he at length reluctantly lets go; yet he tries to persuade us that we should not exhibit the worship of God too accurately, nor entirely recede from his servitude: for he orders the Jews to sacrifice not outside his region, but within its borders. But the most wise Moses said, "It cannot be so." For that inventor of sin is always the author of base things; but the divine law rejects them and forbids those things to be done which please him. Therefore, those who wish to live rightly must attend, not to what that malignant deceiver suggests, but to what the divine response commands. "For your law," he says, "is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my paths..."<sup><a href="#fn110" id="ref110">110</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> So it is.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, when that malignant one deceives and wishes to restrain us, and to subject us to himself, we must serve God, who alone is according to nature; and we must say without any fear: "It cannot be so." — "For no one can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will sustain the one and despise the other."<sup><a href="#fn111" id="ref111">111</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is also written: "Woe to the faint-hearted, and the slack hands, and the sinner walking along two paths!"<sup><a href="#fn112" id="ref112">112</a></sup> For it is necessary, as I think, to offer to God, the ruler of all, a pure worship, free from all blame, having gone out entirely from that life which is under the dominion of that malignant one; and thus to strive bravely towards that other praiseworthy one; otherwise, "We shall sacrifice," he says, "the abominations to the Lord our God. For if we sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians before them, we shall be stoned." And as regards the exposition of the simple history, the excuse was suitable. For he calls here "abominations" those things which they worshipped: for they worshipped a calf; the Egyptians. "Therefore," he says, "if we sacrifice these things to the God of the Hebrews, it is entirely necessary that we provoke the wrath of the Egyptians, who think this must not be borne at all." And this exposition is indeed probable. But as regards the spiritual contemplation, it has no mediocre utility; for if we put to death what the crowd of demons considers great and highly values, and in which it thinks the whole sum is placed, we will exhibit a most pleasing worship to God.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How then?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> What? Do they not value the life of the flesh highly? And indeed not for its own sake, but because through it we are destroyed, and led conquered into their power.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> So it is.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, if we put these things to death, and, as it were, sacrifice them, we will be a sweet-smelling odor to God. Moreover, Paul writes in this manner: "Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, pleasing to God, your reasonable service."<sup><a href="#fn113" id="ref113">113</a></sup> And he will do this rightly who has put to death the members which are on the earth: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and avarice.<sup><a href="#fn114" id="ref114">114</a></sup> Therefore, the individual things which are in us by life, are the abominations of the spiritual Egyptians, that is, their principal worship. And that this is the custom of the Sacred Scriptures, to call that which is in the place of an idol and deity an "abomination," God confirms, when through the voice of Jeremiah He says concerning the Synagogue of the Jews: "Why has my beloved committed abomination in my house?"<sup><a href="#fn115" id="ref115">115</a></sup> But if anyone wishes to understand it as a hateful and detestable thing, he will not have strayed from the right understanding: for the things which the unclean spirits have always been accustomed to hate and abominate, these are offered by us to God for a sweet odor, and are spiritual hosts: faith, gentleness, continence, temperance, mutual love, and the glory of sincere piety towards God.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And who indeed were those who sacrificed in the region of the wicked one? Or who can be understood as those who are outside that region?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Those who have not yet gone out from the lands of the Egyptians, and sacrifice to God there, are certainly very many, and perhaps innumerable: but those who are outside the land and in the wilderness are very few and chosen: "For many are called," He says, "but few are chosen."<sup><a href="#fn116" id="ref116">116</a></sup> Therefore, we have all been called to liberty through the faith which is in Christ, and redeemed from the devil's dominion; Christ leading us to this, who was beautifully prefigured in Moses and Aaron for those ancient men, so that you may understand in the same one, Emmanuel, the lawgiver and chief priest, and the apostle by a dispensatory action. But very many of those who are called, most willingly remain in their old evils, who, since they have not departed from secular error with a whole heart, worship God for the time being with bare and sole faith. These we say are those who sacrifice in Egypt, or at least having gone out a little way. "For do not go far away," said that stiff-necked Pharaoh, "even if you go out from the lands of the Egyptians." But those who transfer themselves perfectly to virtue, and strive to please God, and depart entirely from worldly confusion, these go out from the borders of the Egyptians, and escape the hand and power of the tyrant, and in a life empty and free from cares, as in a wilderness, they sacrifice to God purely and chastely. Indeed, I would say, that for another reason also those must go very far from the borders of the Egyptians, who come from worshipping the creature rather than the Creator to the truth, and are called to the knowledge of Him who is God by nature. For they have not yet perfectly gone out, in whom the remnants of the old error have not yet been wiped away from their mind. For some observe certain days and months, and times and years. These, although they have been called to the dignity of liberty through Christ, yet, dwelling in the region of the Egyptians, they sacrifice to God, because they retain that manner of life which is not very displeasing to Satan. But if anyone has gone out entirely, and has pronounced a great farewell to his former morals, he sacrifices in the wilderness, and leads a life worthy of the highest praise.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I agree; for you think rightly. But now let the discourse return to its channel.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, Pharaoh lies, and denies his promise, and does not yet send away the sons of Israel. Then he is vexed with three other plagues, and at length with difficulty he agrees, and says he will let them go; and again he is caught lying... "For he is a liar, and did not stand in the truth,"<sup><a href="#fn117" id="ref117">117</a></sup> as the Savior says. For when God was threatening and also sending a very violent hail upon the Egyptians, and also the locust, the devastator of the fields (if it is permitted to borrow this word from the Greek); then at last those once fierce and invictible satellites of Pharaoh's crimes cry out against him with the greatest voices, saying: "How long shall this be a stumbling block to us? Let the men go, that they may sacrifice to the Lord their God. Do you not know that all Egypt is perishing?"<sup><a href="#fn118" id="ref118">118</a></sup> And to me again from this place that consideration occurs, that Satan, in those things in which he thinks it fitting for himself to conquer, perhaps shows himself stronger...</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> ...although they are, as it seems, very harsh and utterly unyielding, and indeed scarcely and late, yet they certainly take hold of even a moderate perception of the divine wrath; but this one is surpassed by that unspeakable ferocity, and is hardened to the extreme. For it is written: "For his heart was compacted like a stone, and he stood like an anvil minutely ductile."<sup><a href="#fn119" id="ref119">119</a></sup> When, therefore, there was a very great outcry against him, he said at last to Moses and his companions: "Go and sacrifice to the Lord your God." "But who are they that are to go?" And Moses says: "We will go with our young men and our elders; we will go with our sons and our daughters, with our sheep and our oxen; for it is the feast of the Lord our God." And he said to them: "So be the Lord with you, as I shall let you go, and your little ones? See that evil is set before you. Not so; but let the men go, and sacrifice to God: for this you yourselves also asked."<sup><a href="#fn120" id="ref120">120</a></sup> You understand therefore, Palladius, that Moses was saying they ought to set out with a perfect departure; but he said, "Not so; but I will let go a part," and he said that the part that was left behind ought to be, as it were, a kind of hostage for the return of those departing, with their very baggage remaining in Egypt. "For let every one of your young men go," he says, "and every generation that is in its prime." But the divine Moses strongly affirms that they ought to depart, with nothing passed over or left behind; but together with the adolescents and those of advanced age, with sons and daughters also, and herds of oxen and other cattle. For indeed it is fitting that those who wish to obtain true liberty should strive to depart from the evils which are in the world, and to enter the path that leads to virtues, leaving behind no remnant at all of their soul and mind, through which they might again be brought under the dominion and tyranny of that malignant one. And the divine law calls to this young men and virgins, old men with younger ones, according to the voice of the Psalmist,<sup><a href="#fn121" id="ref121">121</a></sup> and every age that is understood in Christ. To whom also the divine John spoke, saying: "I have written to you, children, because you have known the Father; I have written to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning; I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one."<sup><a href="#fn122" id="ref122">122</a></sup> But in another way, young men can be a type of courage, old men of prudence, and infants of that which is understood in Christ, sons and daughters; for with courage and prudence, and that simplicity which is according to God, we set out from sin to sanctification. "Act manfully," he says, "and let your heart be strengthened."<sup><a href="#fn123" id="ref123">123</a></sup> And again: "Be wise as serpents, and simple as doves."<sup><a href="#fn124" id="ref124">124</a></sup> And when he said that the sheep and oxen should also depart together, he signified perhaps that not even those bodily and irrational motions of ours are to be left to Satan; and so the divine Paul writes, "As you have presented your members as slaves to impurity and to iniquity unto iniquity, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness for sanctification."<sup><a href="#fn125" id="ref125">125</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But for what reason does Pharaoh let go the adults and those of mature age, but retain the others?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Who do you say are those who remain in Egypt?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> They were, I think, without doubt the women, the children not yet of age, the infirm old men, and the brute animals.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Why then, Palladius, do you not immediately understand that?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What is that?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> He considers the robust and young, and those who are already of a firm habit towards piety, to be burdensome and troublesome: for he desires to free himself, I think, though unwillingly, from those who resist him, who can also, when aroused, do something, and avenge his injuries, according to that: "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."<sup><a href="#fn126" id="ref126">126</a></sup> But those who cannot act manfully, he tenaciously holds back, and loves that kind which is of a womanly and soft sense, as being weak and feeble: also that which has not yet reached puberty, and lacks strength, and is still of a childish sense: finally that coarse and more remote from reason, which is signified by the oxen and sheep.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But again that most great and rigid Pharaoh lies. Then, when the whole region was almost destroyed by swarms of locusts, he summons Moses, who was accompanied by Aaron, and says: "Go and serve the Lord your God; but let your sheep and oxen be left behind, and let your baggage go with you..." But Moses: "You yourself will also give us burnt offerings and victims which we may make to the Lord our God, and our cattle shall go with us; and there shall not a hoof be left behind; for from them we shall take to sacrifice to the Lord our God."<sup><a href="#fn127" id="ref127">127</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What meaning can we apply to the things said by the most wise Moses? Or in what way can one understand that the things which were led out from Egypt by Pharaoh's permission were offered to God?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But indeed, Palladius, the discourse is clear. For he who resists those who are able to cultivate piety, and fights against it for them, if he cannot dominate with full power, yet desires to obtain this in some part; but the law of God teaches us to depart entirely in every part, and to leave nothing subject to his dominion and rule: not any part of the soul, not of the mind, not the opportunities of any bodily motion: it teaches that we ought to offer to God the most beautiful and excellent things whatever that are in the secular life. For I think this signifies, to take from Egypt, and to sacrifice to God what has been received from Him. Do not those do this who contend with worldly wisdom for our divine doctrines, and pursue the splendor of speech joined with the keenness of knowledge, and offer to God a reasonable service? "For although all wisdom is from the Lord,"<sup><a href="#fn128" id="ref128">128</a></sup> as it is written, yet we say that the poets and writers of the Gentiles have attained that eloquence of speech by a worldly spirit; and so the blessed Paul says, "We have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is from God, that we may understand the things bestowed on us by God. And we speak about them not with words taught by human wisdom, but with words taught by the Spirit."<sup><a href="#fn129" id="ref129">129</a></sup> But that Moses, though in a shadowy way, yet truly says that the things which are held as principal in this secular life are by no means rejected by the true God, he clearly shows continuously, at least in figure and shadow. For by God's command, he says it was necessary to despoil the Egyptians, and to borrow gold and silver vessels from their neighbor and fellow-dweller. This very thing was perfectly done by the women; for that sex is most apt for whispering and loquacity, and ingenious for constructing frauds. And the gold and silver vessels were borrowed from the Egyptians, as I think, and as I just said, about which it would be right for some who are in the world to boast, if they also acknowledged the true God. But what I say is again of this kind. The motions of the mind and soul are common to all men, and an intellect apt for all things, both for good and for evil. And those who rightly use the more excellent gifts of nature, lead a praiseworthy and outstanding life: but those who most foolishly distort these to things which are not fitting, show in a way that the goods of nature can also be transferred to the most base uses. For courage and prudence are indeed excellent for those using them best, but the same, when possessed by those not using them rightly, become harmful: for it happens to act bravely and prudently with praise and applause, it happens to possess these same things with great disgrace for all. But these are common, and in all, both in those who are still in error, and in those who have known God. When, therefore, the courage which was formerly the artisan of wickedness, and that acuteness of understanding, are taken in a way from the Egyptians and from the secular life, and turned by us to that which is pleasing to God, they become sacred and acceptable to God; for they are transferred to the use of virtue and the ministry of holiness; as indeed it is declared that the gold and silver vessels from Egypt were for building and completing the tabernacle. After the despoiling of the Egyptians, therefore, and the death of the firstborn, the Israelites were at last set free, when they had immolated the lamb in the figure of Christ; for they could not otherwise achieve this; for all redemption is in Christ, and through Him every perfect gift is given. Moreover, they are sent out from Egypt around midnight, having set out as if from darkness and servitude at the same time; for those who are slaves of sin almost always desire to be in spiritual darkness, not in the divine light: "for everyone who does evil hates the light,"<sup><a href="#fn130" id="ref130">130</a></sup> as the Savior says. They also carry out a mass of unleavened dough, and flee without provisions. "For the Egyptians," it says, "were urgent with the people, to send them quickly out of the land. For they said: We shall all die. And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders."<sup><a href="#fn131" id="ref131">131</a></sup> For I think that those who are about to cling to God, and have entered into familiarity with Him, ought not to carry the remnants of worldly malice, nor to be equipped for the journey with foreign and profane provisions, that is, clearly with spiritual ones; but to be unleavened and sincere, and to seek that bread which gives life to the world; such men will celebrate purely, and offering the unleavened worship to God, they will remain under Him forever.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is concluded, therefore, that whatever men are lovers of God and good, they ought to arrive, as at a certain holy and sacred land, namely to the life to be led under Christ's rule, and free from the force of tyranny, and to strive to sacrifice, not in the territories of the enemies, that is, not with that disposition of soul which loves sin, and if not altogether blameless, yet with a disposition eager and raised towards virtue, and in a state of character far removed from the devil's tyranny.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do not suppose it to be otherwise than thus, Palladius; for our discourse has been correctly concluded. But it is easy, if it pleases, to contemplate this same thing in another image. For when the inhabitants of the holy city, Jerusalem, I say, by a headlong course into all crimes, had dared to offend God the Savior of all, they came under the power of the Babylonians: who, when they had taken them by force and arms, ordered them to serve; for necessity compelled the conquered to yield to the conquerors, even unwillingly. When, therefore, they were very much dismayed, and groaned on account of the unexpected calamities, they sometimes sought even a slight solace of their labors: and this was, with songs composed in praise of God, to soften the bitterness of their present sorrow. "For I remembered God," says David, "and I was delighted,"<sup><a href="#fn132" id="ref132">132</a></sup> by which words he declared that songs to God are a spiritual feast: but to those wishing to sing songs, and to fulfill their customary duty, it seemed almost shameful to commit so sweet a sound to the ears of foreigners, and to pour forth their sweetest and most delightful song, as it were, into the air, while the Babylonians sometimes laughed at them, and were utterly displeased with the songs of the musical instruments. And so they said: "By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept, when we remembered you, O Zion;"<sup><a href="#fn133" id="ref133">133</a></sup> in which city, according to the prescription of the laws and customs of the Jews, the sacrifice of praise was offered, accomplished with strings and pipes, and charming with its melodies those coming to the divine temple. But since they were bound by the yoke of servitude among foreign nations, groaning they said: "On the willows in the midst thereof we hung up our instruments;"<sup><a href="#fn134" id="ref134">134</a></sup> signifying by this very thing the cessation of songs; for the willow is an unfruitful plant, indeed fruit-destroying, to speak better; for so it is called from a certain Greek poet. They hung up the musical instruments, therefore, for cessation and sterility; and crying out the cause of this cessation, they say: "How shall we sing the song of the Lord in a foreign land?"<sup><a href="#fn135" id="ref135">135</a></sup> But when Jeremiah had brought words to them: "They all wept," it says, "and prayed before the Lord; and they gathered silver, according to what each one's hand could afford, and sent it to Jerusalem to Joakim the son of Hilkiah, the son of Shallum the priest, and to the priests, and to all the people who were found with him in Jerusalem."<sup><a href="#fn136" id="ref136">136</a></sup> And after a little: "And they said, Behold, we have sent you silver; buy with the silver burnt offerings, and for sin, and incense, and make manna, and offer it on the altar of the Lord our God."<sup><a href="#fn137" id="ref137">137</a></sup> For they thought it fitting that they themselves should abstain from sacrifices for a time, since they were far from the holy land, and were not yet living under God's rule, but were subject to another lord, and had come under a tyrannical dominion; but they entrusted the parts of the divine worship to those who still dwelt in the holy city, and had obtained the glorious office of administering the sacred rites; in which, clearly, they considered with the best reason what was fitting and what was necessary. That most wise Daniel himself also devoted himself to sacred studies;<sup><a href="#fn138" id="ref138">138</a></sup> and although he was a captive with the others, he also wisely used the evils of necessity. I will tell how: for three times each day he prayed; and he had windows in his upper room that looked towards Jerusalem, and were open: for so it is written. For he thought his prayer would then be pleasing to God, when, if he could not be there in body, at least in soul he might separate himself from the foreign and hateful land, and with the eyes of his mind look towards the land most pleasing to God; and into the very temple, as it were, offer prayers for whatever he wished.</p>
