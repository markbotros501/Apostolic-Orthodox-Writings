    <h1>On Adoration and Worship in Spirit and Truth, Book IV</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">That he who has been called to righteousness by God and (been) redeemed must follow Him. And he must not only reject the depravity of moral weakness, but must rather strive earnestly to live in accordance with the law and in a vigorous manner.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is indeed dangerous, Palladius, as it seems, and even, if I may say so, most abominable and utterly wicked, not to be accustomed to act manfully against wickedness and sin; but to be enervated, as it were, by disgraceful pleasures, and to sink into effeminate softnesses, and to shun the efforts of virtue, although it is in our power to ascend by the help of Christ to every kind of praiseworthy thing; and to this end the most blessed Paul exhorts us with these words: "Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak very well.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For in Christ we shall do valiantly; nor yet, I think, does it happen to anyone that he can act bravely against anything without labor, and raise his soul to it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I agree.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For it is a most excellent thing, and one in which it is worth putting effort to obtain, which cannot be held by supine men; but it is most easily prepared for by him who prefers labor to sloth. For it is written: "The man who labors, labors for himself, and drives his own destruction."<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> But to think that the most excellent things can be obtained with little labor is foolish, I think. What? Is it not the most desirable of all things to save the soul, and for each one to strive to retain his own life?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very much so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But that glory and brightness, which do you think most befits the athletes: those who contend with right and exercise, and who have the greatest account of victory; or those who flow in most pleasant pleasures, and have preferred a life of idleness as the best and most excellent?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How indeed, or whence can there be any doubt to anyone, that it least becomes those who are given to idleness to conquer, but that victory is to be obtained by those who have been more eager?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Shall we then say that those who have said much for salvation by labors, and have embraced a remiss and voluptuous life, will this itself be glory for them?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> By no means.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is therefore consequent, that they who most willingly undertake labors deserve praise now; nor does the glory of a name happen to anyone without a contest.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It seems to agree so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Rightly therefore, Palladius, we ought to proceed to praiseworthy things; and to strive for that fortitude which tends to virtue, and that greatness of soul which is excellent, which the divinely inspired Scripture is wont to admire, and which is familiar and friendly to the souls of holy men. Therefore that admirable man David, speaking to those who were studious of it, says: "Act manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, all you who hope in the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> And as if he himself had previously fulfilled this very thing, he speaks magnificently of himself, and says: "The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Innumerable scandals surround us: but the multitude of demons, I think, exceeds all number, who incite us to sin: besides, the savagery of innate pleasures in us is not ignoble, avarice, boastfulness, envy not far from slaughter, hatreds also and detractions rush upon us, and other vices of this kind. Therefore those who are fickle and easily led away, when they do not even touch with the tips of their fingers the contest undertaken against such vices, carelessly concede victory to the enemy (like a half-cooked snail), according to the voice of the prophet, cast to the ground, and, as it were without a fight, prostrated under the feet of wickedness. But indeed the lovers of this man, and good men, and those who desire that celestial glory and wish to be partakers of that eternal life, meet the rushing disturbances bravely and strenuously, when they mortify the flesh and rise up against those motions which are in it and from it. And so, having driven away every kind of wickedness and sin with great skill and industry, they lead a holy and blameless life: to whom also the divine man Paul speaks, saying: "Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the fiery darts of the wicked one."<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> For the spiritual armor most befits holy men, which we, even if in another way, yet the Savior Himself commands us to expect: "For let your loins," He says, "be girded, and your shoes on your feet, and burning lamps."<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> For by the word "girded" is signified that we ought to be girded, and as it were with gathered and compressed garment, ready to endure evils for virtue and the love of God; and the shod feet indicate that we are prepared and eager to migrate from this world, that we may set out as soon as possible wherever the divine command orders us to go; and the burning lamps finally signify that no one ought to live in darkness and ignorance, but to strive in the light of Christ for all things that are praiseworthy. To the Jews indeed, because they were of unsound mind, refusing to do this, Christ spoke, saying, "While you have the light, walk in the light, lest darkness overtake you."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Therefore, eagerness to pursue virtue, and fortitude joined with prudence, makes the lover of piety illustrious and conspicuous.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak very well.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For it is not lawful to obtain glory by a dissolute and remiss life; but rather, even if anyone should decide to endure labors and sweats, yet he will scarcely obtain splendid and distinguished praise. And so to the sons of Israel, when they were still dwelling in Egypt, that profane Pharaoh indeed imposed taskmasters, grievous and harsh: but they, because they made that harsh way of life, though unwilling and imposed by necessity, an exercise for endurance, were rather benefited than injured. For the Hebrew Pharaoh feared when he saw them growing into an immense multitude; and with the greatest malice he endeavored to restrain the growth and increase of that people: "He set," it says, "taskmasters over them, to afflict them with burdens."<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> But this plan of his had the opposite result; for that very vexation which was inflicted became an occasion of increase for them, when God governed the matter with His wisdom, and opposed His grace to the Pharaoh's malice. "For the more they afflicted them," it says, "the more they multiplied and grew."<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> For although Satan brings tribulations, gnashing his teeth against the race of saints; and he rushes upon those whom God has claimed as His own, always watching over them, "For they are His chosen,"<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> He says: yet, those who labor diligently in such things become better by the very things by which they are tempted, and the endurance of contests undoubtedly makes them more illustrious, so that through those things which he thinks to trouble and vex, through them also, even unwillingly, he benefits, and through which he thinks to conquer them, through the same he makes them stronger. But when Pharaoh saw that his cunning device had an outcome other than he had thought, and that in that very thing in which he thought he was harming, he was also helping, having at last, though late, begun to perceive it, he immediately changed his plan of attack. For having summoned the Hebrew midwives, he said, "When you midwife the Hebrew women, and the time of delivery comes, if it is a male, kill him; but if a female, preserve her. But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded them, and they kept the male children alive."<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> And when that impiety against the Hebrew race, and the plan of murder, had come to nothing (for God did not permit the midwives to commit such a crime), he now turned to open force and injury, and not content to vex secretly any longer, he undertakes open war, and decrees a cruel death for those who were born. "For Pharaoh commanded," it says, "all his people, saying, 'Every male that is born to the Hebrews, cast into the river; and every female, keep alive.'"<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> For he had no concern for the female sex; for the female sex is unwarlike and not suited for wisdom; but the male is troublesome in both respects, as being both wise and also most fit for war. Therefore, that foul dragon, Satan, I say, finds most pleasant and agreeable that effeminate sense of soul, weak and unwarlike, and also little suited for wisdom: but hostile and hateful to him is that eagerness for fortitude, and the strength of soul superior to languor and fear, and the mind endowed with the highest prudence. For this reason he preserves the female sex alive, and in it he lays down that bloody deliberation and plan. For it is foolish, I think, to wish to fight with those who are prostrate by themselves, and are so disposed of their own accord that they prefer to be subject: but he suffocates the male, as it were, when he casts him into the gulfs of temptations, as the prophet says: "Unless the Lord had been in us, when men rose up against us, then they would have swallowed us alive; when their wrath was kindled against us, then the water would have overwhelmed us; our soul has passed through the torrent."<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> So it is.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Observe then the manner of the plot. For first he instructed them with savage labors, most wickedly scheming that they should not increase into a great multitude, through which he thought to harm; and the injury was still secret, the tyrant's purpose not very manifest; but it was opposed, as I said just now, by the grace of the compassionate one. And the more they were humbled, the more they increased in strength and number. Then through the midwives he wished to arm them against the Hebrew women. But God did not permit this to prevail either. Finally, in the third and last manner of plotting, he commanded all his own people to suffocate the male, no longer avoiding the appearance of tyranny. Therefore, against those who act manfully, Satan wages war invisibly, and composes plots in a threefold form: and he begins the battle indeed with cunning schemes, hindering the progress of the mind to virtue: for he prepares them to be worn out by unexpected labors and to be involved in harsh struggles. But when he could do nothing by these, God helping, he often incites those who are our kinsmen by faith and of the same race, and tries to sharpen them to enmity and fight. And Paul will testify, saying: "In perils from false brethren, in perils from my own race."<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> But if indeed he should fail in this, God, the protector of the saints, inspiring them with divine fear, as formerly to the midwives; then at last he openly arouses his own satellites to savagery and murder. But we will resist even thus with love of confidence and zeal for fortitude, not ignorant that what is hated by him is honorable to God. For He sets in word and worthy of care the overcoming of the above-mentioned softness.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I am persuaded. And I think this is also at hand, and we can contemplate it from the Holy Scripture itself. For it is not a rejection of ideas, surely.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, God granting, let us speak what is in the book called Numbers; and this is a book of Moses: "And the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the testimony, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying: Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to the number of names, every male by their polls; every male from twenty years old and above, all who go out in the army of Israel, you shall number them by their armies: you and Aaron shall number them."<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> Therefore, whoever is male, and most fit for fight, and has reached puberty, that is, to spiritual firmness, and to the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ, that he is enrolled in the divine description and in the book of God can be seen most clearly from these words: for no other cause, I think, is the male numbered, and he who is twenty years old and above, than that we ourselves may understand that he is rejected by God, and therefore disapproved, who is unwarlike and not perfect in sense, both of which we say are in those who are still mere youths and have not yet reached the measure of puberty: which measure the divine law sets and defines. And this is the twentieth year: but he is in value and in number, and is known by God by people and family, and by heads, and by name, whoever is now of adult age and male. For to the holy apostles, who were now of such manly age and had reached that measure of reason, it was said by Christ at some time: "Do not rejoice that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven."<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> At another time again: "Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them falls to the ground without your Father, who is in heaven. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered."<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> In which, when He says that the hairs are numbered, He clearly indicates, I think, with how diligent care He follows them. Therefore, those who are of adult age and males are entered in the book of God. And that census description was made through Moses and Aaron, that through both we may understand one Christ, as in Moses the lawgiver, as in Aaron the high priest: for our legislator was made both holy and innocent and high priest, and by the work of that mediator the census of those who are of manly age and virtue conspicuous above others is described in the divine books. To whom also that most wise John spoke, when he said: "I write to you, young men, because you are strong and have overcome the evil one."<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> And such are those of whom we just spoke: "Every male from twenty years old and above, every one who goes out in the army of Israel."<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> That God provides for these from their maker, and has care for them, that he who is a lover of virtue may easily perceive, Palladius, also through the things that are written subsequently. For again to Moses and Aaron, God, without doubt, says: "And with you there shall be a man from every tribe, each one the head of his father's house. And these are the names of the men who shall stand with you."<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> For each tribe appointed as leader and champion, and chief in counsel, and author of actions, him who excelled others in glory and virtue of fighting: whose figure the angels bear, who are set over those select men and described in the book of life. For it is written concerning each and every just and good man: "The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him, and delivers them."<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> But that we are surrounded by the help of angels, God so willing, can be made manifest from everywhere, and I think it superfluous to heap up proofs of this matter in the present place, since especially for those wishing to do so it is at hand, and indeed most easily, if only they so decide.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, in the figure of Moses and Aaron, you think that the description and census of strong men is made through Christ?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> I think so: for to this manner of exposition a not improbable conjecture leads us from that which is in Daniel.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What is that?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For he contemplated as it were the Father in old age, adorned with white hair, distinguished with a garment white as snow, and said: "The books were opened and the judgment sat, and I saw. And behold, with the clouds of heaven as the Son of Man was coming, and He came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before Him. And to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom."<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> For when the Only-begotten was made in our form, then the Father opened the books, and rested from judging those who were guilty of sins: He also gave power to strong men, that it might be lawful for them to be enrolled and numbered among those heavenly choirs, and to be contained in the memory of God. Hear also the blessed David singing concerning those who raged against Christ: "Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous."<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> For they fell away by weakness of reason, and were terrified by the sternness of Christ's conversation, when the same honor was offered to them by the kind and merciful will of God and the Father: for they were called to the wedding, but they answered the holy invitees negligently and remissly, saying, one that he had bought a field, another that he had married a wife, and could not come. You hear them everywhere saying: "I cannot."<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> For the human mind, inclined to the pleasures of the world, is weak and feeble for executing the things of God: and so it will be absent from the divine and heavenly feast.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, only adult and flourishing men, and now adorned with prudence, are enrolled in the description of God and in the book of life; and all who are not of this kind are disapproved, or not?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> If you apply your mind accurately and vigilantly to the Scripture, you will certainly understand what is true. For not only he who is adult and twenty years old is described, but the description of every male is commanded. Or do you understand what I say a little?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I understand.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> If therefore that fortitude which is understood in Christ alone is sought, and the mode of executing the virtue of those who are suitable is inquired into, they will have their own description who have attained to this glory, since they are now strong and prompt for fight, and have surpassed boyish understanding, is it not so, Palladius, that whoever shall be like us, to him also some place of description and glory proper and fitting will be suitable, which may be proportioned to the splendor of things done?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I confess.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For he will never be in the number of the holy apostles who has been unlike them; by no means, I say.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But again we do not assert that the rank which those holy men have attained, who have been very illustrious with many kinds of virtues and have cultivated a way of life most agreeable to the divine law, will be attained by him also who has been by no means such; but that he will obtain according to his own measure, is not obscure.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, in that we have believed in the Savior and Redeemer of all, and through baptism have obtained that strength given from heaven and on high; for we have put on the power from on high (that is, sealed and marked by the Holy Spirit), we also have been placed in the order and number of males, and have been reckoned in the book of God. Yet there is also some distinction here: for the more sacred and holier are placed first, as it were, in this description and nearer to God. For although faith in Christ is one, yet not all believers are equal in morals and kind of life; but some indeed so, others so, according to the word of the blessed Paul.<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup> Therefore, those who excel in gravity of life, and are therefore holier, hold the first place in the divine description and in the monuments of God; but those in whom sanctity is less, because they are inferior in virtue, undoubtedly obtain the second place in the descriptions.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But how can this also be made clear?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> From the very testimony of the Scripture itself: for we do not speak rashly: for after that enumeration which recounted the males and men of more vigorous age, the God of all things again designated to us another mode of description. And it is of this kind: "And the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying: Number the sons of Levi by their fathers' houses, by their families, by their peoples; every male from a month old and above you shall number them. And Moses and Aaron numbered them according to the word of the Lord, as the Lord commanded them."<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup> The description having been made by peoples and by fathers' houses, he immediately adds the whole sum, saying: "All the numbering of the sons of Levi, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the Lord by their peoples, every male from a month old and above, twenty-two thousand."<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup> To this he immediately joins and says: "And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Number every firstborn male of the sons of Israel from a month old and above, and take the number of their names, and you shall take the Levites for me, I am the Lord, instead of all the firstborn of the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the sons of Israel. And Moses numbered, as the Lord commanded him, all the firstborn males according to the number of names from a month old and above, from their numbering, twenty-two thousand three hundred and seventy. And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn of the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle, and the Levites shall be mine; I am the Lord; and the redemption of the two hundred and seventy-three, the excess over the Levites from the firstborn of the sons of Israel; and you shall take five shekels per head, according to the holy didrachm; you shall take twenty obols per shekel, and you shall give the money to Aaron and his sons, the redemption of those who are in excess among them."<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> How deep and difficult to reach is the matter, Palladius, to be able to look into the things commanded here, finely and accurately.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak well; but nevertheless lower your mind to the examination, trusting in Christ, the giver of all good.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Know then, that in the first description, everything was male, and twenty years old was required, that is, the prudent and brave, and in the prime of the power to accomplish whatever God willed. But let our discourse about this suffice. For it has been made, as I think, sufficiently. In these two descriptions, every male from the tribe of Levi is enrolled in the divine and sacred rolls. From the other multitude, not every male simply, but the firstborn, but from a month old and above all are numbered. Now the numbering of the Levite infants is twenty-two thousand; but that of the firstborn is twenty-two thousand three hundred and seventy. Then God ordains that the Levites must be offered instead of the firstborn. But since the popular number is found to be superior or to exceed by two hundred and seventy-three heads, the lawgiver has decreed that the redemption money should be brought for them to the Levitical tribe, as if they would perform the liturgies for them, and offer the services, receiving this as a kind of reward for their undistracted attendance. Do you not confess that in these the meaning of the proposed Scriptures is briefly comprehended?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I do.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> I will ask that then; and my discourse will not proceed from the mark, according to what is likely and not unreasonably: for the one was the remembrance of manliness and prudence understood in Christ, and as in a type, the male sex was described, which was not of weak bodily age. But because besides it was necessary that that description also which is made through faith and charity in Christ should be clearly signified, at the same time comprehending that distinction which is seen in those who believe, of whom some, as soon as they have received faith, devote themselves to sacred works and the service of God, others do not dedicate themselves wholly to God but are divided and give part of themselves to secular things; for this cause, with very good right, the lawgiver ordered that sacred distinction of men, which is understood in the Levitical race as in a type, to be preferred, and commanded it to hold the first place in the description. For this cause he made mention first of the Levitical race. Then follows, and is joined to it, the numbering of the males and firstborn. For that race of men is in value with God, which is seen to be endowed as it were with spiritual fortitude and conformed to Christ, who is the firstborn. Therefore the blessed Paul writes to some who were limping in faith and effeminate in frigid opinions: "My little children, for whom I am again in labor until Christ be formed in you."<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup> Therefore, whoever shall be firstborn, as being conformed to Christ, is admitted into the book of God: likewise male and adorned with prudence. But I would wish you to observe that from the other tribes, as I said just now, not every male is numbered without distinction, but only the firstborn: for not all men are distinguished by faith and conformed to Christ; for very many are unbelievers: but he alone is described and numbered who is firstborn, on account of Him who is the Firstborn among us and many brethren.<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup> But in the census of the Levites, every male promiscuously, without rejection, is brought into the descriptions and collected into the sum: for what is holy is in every way akin to God. But they are described from a month old and above: and what reason can be brought for this? That indeed, because that infancy of the faithful in Christ is by no means rejected by God; for that smallness of age is as it were a mark of that simplicity in Christ and spiritual infancy. For as we were saying, the description was rightly made of one time of those who were most prompt for fight, the sign of that infancy in Christ is clear. Paul says: 'Brothers, do not be children in your thinking; be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature!'</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> So therefore we must think that we shall be partakers of those things which the holy men have each happily done at their own risk, in that they have shown themselves men and have taken the utmost care that they might deserve praise.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Very much so: for although indeed they themselves are full of divine charisms, and have obtained this gift by labors and sweats, and have run through infinite contests; yet they also pour out their gifts upon us from the charity of God. Therefore the blessed Paul was speaking to certain ones who had believed: "For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift."<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup> Or do you deny that knowledge of God, free from reproof and error, and the most certain understanding of the most excellent things, is a spiritual gift?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Indeed I confess it; for to know what nature and who truly is the maker and God of all things, and what is the best path, that indeed leads to that perpetual and eternal life.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You speak rightly. And Christ taught us this, when he commanded his holy apostles, saying: "Freely you have received, freely give."<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> In another way also, that splendor of holy men is not useless to other men: for by their well-performed deeds, our unhappily performed deeds are overwhelmed, and when our virtue-loving God considers the fortitude of the souls of more noble men, he pardons the crimes of the weaker. And so the Israelites, when they were carried headlong to contempt of the divine commands, and omitted no part of wickedness upon which they did not expend effort, necessarily stirred up the wrath of the lawgiver against themselves; and when he wished to exact punishments for their crimes from those who had so monstrously offended, the prophet Jeremiah brought supplications to him. And what did God say to these things? "Go about in the streets of Jerusalem, and see and know, and seek in its broad places; and if you find a man, if there is anyone who executes judgment, and seeks faith; and I will be propitious to them, says the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup> He also said he would pardon the punishments of fire to the Sodomites, if only five pious and upright men were found there.<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup> Therefore, the nobility of holy men sometimes obtains for even the greatest sinners that they are not immediately punished, when it appeases the divine indignation and recalls his wrath. But with those who have sincerely received the faith, yet have not been able to attain the magnitude of virtue, so as to procure for themselves an abundance of divine gifts by labor, they almost share the praise of their own deeds, in that they instruct them, as far as possible, and lead them to all things whatsoever that are pleasing to God; and they admit them into the fellowship of their own brave deeds; and what they themselves have produced with the greatest labors, they implant in the souls of other men. Moreover, that we will be partakers of the glory which is in the holy men, and will be associates of their gloriously performed deeds, God in his kindness and mercy confounding and mixing our faults and weaknesses with their rightly performed actions, and conferring that which is begun and imperfect with that which is more perfect, so that it may be acceptable and pleasing, this also can be made manifest.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What is that?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The Moabites and Midianites were impious and barbarous nations; they inhabited the land which the sons of Israel were to possess. And when the war was now near and at hand, and they were unequal and about to engage with the army of the Israelites, they tried by magical arts and nefarious studies, to which they themselves were devoted, to repel the enemy. But when they attempted all things and inconvenienced the enemy not at all (since God was his protector, and had turned the false prophet Balaam, who had been hired for a reward to curse, to blessing), as they were now brought to the utmost lack of counsel, they took this reasoning among themselves, that they could not harm the Israelites in any other way unless they offended God, in whom their protection was established, and being stripped of the supreme aid, they judged that battle should be undertaken against them. And so, since they knew the male sex to be fervid and prone towards women; and that youth was not safe against such obscene pleasures, they sent forth adorned little women, who would draw the sons of Israel to foul intercourse; by whose appearance whoever were inclined to the vileness of the flesh were most easily captured; and following their persuasion, they were gradually led away from the worship of God. And so, to the disease of fornication was added the languor of apostasy. For it is written: "And you were initiated to the idol Baal of Peor."<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> God himself also spoke thus by the voice of the prophet: "And an understanding people joined itself with the prostitute."<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> He bore these most grievous scourges, not undeservedly, the lawgiver; nor was that matter unpunished for the Israelites; for immediately on account of this crime they suffered intolerable evils: for those who had fornicated were each slain by the hand of their brother and neighbor. But God immediately commanded that war should be undertaken against the Midianites, saying to Moses, that interpreter of sacred things: "Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites; and afterwards you shall be gathered to your people."<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> And Moses spoke to the people, saying: "Arm men from among you for war, and let them fight before the Lord against Midian, to execute the vengeance of the Lord upon Midian. A thousand from each tribe, a thousand from each tribe out of all the tribes of Israel, you shall send to the war."<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup> So there were numbered out of the thousands of Israel a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. And Moses sent them, a thousand from each tribe, and a thousand from each tribe with their army: and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, and the holy vessels, and the trumpets of the signals were in their hands. And they fought against Midian, as the Lord commanded Moses, and they slew every male, and they slew the kings of Midian together with their slain, namely Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian; and Balaam the son of Beor they slew with the sword together with their slain; and they took captive the women of Midian, and their baggage, and their cattle, and their goods and their substance they plundered, and all their cities, which were in their dwellings, they burned with fire, and they took all the booty and all the spoils, from man to beast, and brought them to Moses and to Eleazar the priest, and to all the children of Israel the captives, and the spoils and the booty in the camp, in the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan near Jericho. And Moses and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the synagogue went out to meet them outside the camp, and Moses was angry with fury against the commanders of the army, the officers over thousands and hundreds, who were coming from the battle of the war; and Moses said to them: "Why have you saved all the females alive? For these were to the children of Israel according to the word of Balaam, to cause them to apostatize, and to despise the word of the Lord because of Peor; and there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord. And now kill every male in all the number, and every woman who has known the bed of a male; kill them. But all the number of the females, who have not known the bed of a male, keep them alive for yourselves."<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup> When God had commanded these things, chosen young men assembled for waging war, and from each tribe, those who were most accustomed to enduring labors, and most approved for fighting, came together, so that whoever excelled from each tribe might be a glory to the whole people, and the nobility of one part might pertain to the whole fullness; similarly as it is most wisely said by Paul: "For whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it."<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You understand rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, the most brave line of chosen young men contended against the Midianites, and with them was Phinehas the priest, and also the sacred vessels and the trumpets, which were called of the signals. For always together with those who bear themselves bravely, Christ, our great high priest, is at the same time in arms, and present to bring help; the angels also fight at the same time, who are signified by the sacred vessels. For the holy vessels, suited for divine ministries, are those rational spirits in heaven: for they are appointed by God to bring help to us. There are also no less the trumpets of the signals, that is, the words of the divine preachers, which most clearly signify how bravely we must fight against the enemies, that is, the passions of the soul which are innate in us. Therefore the priest, I mean Phinehas, is a figure of Christ, but the sacred vessels of the angels, and the trumpets of the signals of those who preach to us the word of God. For thus we will overcome the enemy in Christ without labor, saying that which is sung in the Psalms: "In you we will push down our enemies with the horn, and in your name we will despise them that rise up against us."<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup> The Israelites themselves did this: for when they had laid waste in a hostile manner all the cities and the whole region of the Midianites, they brought all the captives to Eleazar the priest, and to the whole congregation of the children of Israel: for the illustrious deeds of holy men are offered like sacred and chosen gifts to Christ the high priest of all, nor are they hidden from the people, according to that: "There is nothing hidden, that shall not be made manifest; nor anything secret, that shall not be known and come to light."<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup> Therefore, all that booty from the captivity is brought into the sight of the priest and the whole people, by a figurative and wise administration. Moreover, Moses rebuked the victors, because they had not transacted the matter with sufficient accuracy and in a manner that could in no way be reprehended: for it was not fitting, he said, to take the males alive, nor likewise the females who had experienced marriage. And the reason of the history is probable: for it was altogether necessary that the male race should be exterminated from that region, which was shortly to be under their dominion, which, when it had soon come to adult and robust age, would be hostile to that people: and the female sex also had to be destroyed at the same time, which had given occasion of scandal: and, if it were preserved, it would perhaps give it again. But as pertains to the spiritual contemplation, that, unless I am mistaken, can be understood not inconveniently signified in this matter.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What is that?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Those chosen soldiers from the tribes, although they had gained the victory, nevertheless did not escape blame: by which it is signified, and indeed manifestly, that not even to those themselves who bear themselves bravely does it ever happen that they are free from all blame in every part. For this very thing, which we seem to have done rightly, will in no way be free from reproof and blame, if God should search out and investigate the matter more diligently. And therefore it is written: "If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?"<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup> And again: "Cleanse me from my secret faults, and spare your servant from strange sins; if they have not dominion over me, then I shall be blameless."<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup> There is therefore sometimes room for just accusation even in the brave deeds of eminent men, which the prudence of the lawgiver perceives, although it escapes our notice: for we do not detect it in any way according to that: "Who can understand his errors?"<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup> Moreover, Isaiah says that all our righteousness is as a menstruous cloth.<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup> For to preserve purity and integrity in every part does by no means happen to us. Paul also, a most wise man, although he had said: "I am conscious of nothing in myself," added nevertheless: "but I am not thereby justified; but he that judges me is the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> Moreover, that rebuke of Moses did not touch all without distinction, but only the bishops and leaders of the army and the officers over thousands and hundreds: "For powerful torment shall be to the powerful,"<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup> and it is most just that especially with them it should be dealt: "For from him to whom much is committed, much will be required."<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup> Therefore that disciple of our Savior wrote: "Be not many masters, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive the greater judgment."<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup> Therefore, upon the bishops and those who preside over orders, the common fault is conferred. For almost always by the vigilance of the rulers it happens that the souls of those who are under them are saved, as it is written to the peoples who were under authority: "Obey your prelates, and be subject to them; for they watch over your souls, as those that are to give an account."<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup> But after the killing of the women and children, the divine Moses does not permit those soldiers to settle themselves in the camp, but orders that they first be purified, saying: "And you shall camp outside the camp seven days: everyone who has killed a person, and everyone who has touched a wounded person, shall be purified on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives, and every garment, and every leather vessel, and every work of goats' hair, and every wooden vessel you shall purify."<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup> Do you see that even the best and most approved kind of the chosen among us is not entirely without blame? "For no one is clean from filth,"<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup> even if one is accustomed to be among the most approved: for that perfect holiness is reserved for the future age. Therefore he places the victors outside the camp, and says that they must be purified on the third day and the seventh. And the third day indeed signifies to us the third time, in which that purification through Christ took place, after the time of Moses, and in which the choir of the holy prophets was manifested, or the time of the Resurrection, in which Christ rose again, having nailed to the venerable cross the handwriting that was against us, and having endured the passion which took away sin for our sake.<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup> But the seventh day suggests to the mind the time which will be at the consummation of the present age, in which, having shaken off the whole burden of sin, and going to the highest sanctification, we shall be with Christ, leading a pure and purified life, and a most blessed life according to Christ.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is well, as it seems to me.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You will surely wonder also at the mystery that follows next in order: for immediately the speech of Moses is taken up by Eleazar the priest, and he says to the men of the army who were coming from the battle line of the war: "This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded Moses: except for the gold, and the silver, and the brass, and the iron, and the lead, and the tin, every thing that will pass through the fire shall be purified by fire, but whatever cannot stand the fire you shall pass through the water. And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean, and afterwards you shall come into the camp."<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup> Observe therefore that Moses first indicated to the victors the time for purification, but not yet the manner. For the law proclaims beforehand the time of the purification through Christ; but in the second place, after Moses, the priest speaks, that is, Eleazar. For Christ gives commandments after the law, and indeed no longer declares the time of purification to the brave and strong men: for that was the time itself; but he introduces the manner, and places the mystery itself, so to speak, before our eyes, interpreting what the law especially looked to. For he commands that the vessels, whatever could endure the force of fire, should be passed through fire; but whatever did not have a fiery nature, but were weak, and whatever could be entirely corrupted, for example, clothing, and whatever was made from skins and wood, should be passed through water; clearly signifying us figuratively by the name of the golden and silver vessels, and those made from the other metals, who have been cleansed by that purification made through Christ, as if by fire and water: for we have been baptized in the Holy Spirit and fire.<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup> That therefore the things which were collected from the captivity are passed through fire and water, aptly signifies our purification made a little before, whom Christ claimed for himself as certain riches from the devil, when the strong one, having entered, plundered his vessels and bound the strong man.<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup> Then at last Eleazar says that it is permitted to the victors to enter the camp, when on the seventh day they have washed their clothes: and thus at length they would be clean. For the perfect purification and the laying aside of all uncleanness will be in the times of the consummation of the age, as I just said; when, sin having been entirely removed, man's nature will be recalled to that ancient and pristine beauty. "For then," he says, "the way will be clean, and the way will be called holy, and no unclean person will pass through it, but the redeemed by the Lord will walk in it."<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup> I think this explanation of this passage is not foreign to the purpose. But if anyone understands it otherwise, let him think so. Moreover, he commanded that the vessels of the victors, whether perhaps golden, or silver, or even made of brass, or from any other material, should pass through fire: for as the blessed Paul writes, "The fire will test each one's work of what sort it is."<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup> He also commanded that they should pass through water; for the words of the Psalms suggest to us that the souls of holy men are tested in no other way than by certain similar methods. And so David sang: "You have tested us, O God; you have tried us as silver is tried; we went through fire and water, and you brought us out into refreshment."<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But, I pray you, perhaps the more studious will say: How those chosen men from the tribes fought with and conquered the Midianites, and how they wiped away the stains contracted from the battle, your discourse has abundantly shown us: but now it is time for you to prove whether we will truly be partakers of the fortitude of the strong men, and associates of their gloriously performed deeds, although we have by no means an equal weight in virtue, and are far inferior to their magnanimity: for your discourse promised this to us.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And indeed, the established law concerning this matter follows next and is joined, having indeed a very clear proof, and not hard and difficult to understand: "And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Take the sum of the spoils of the captives, from man to beast, you and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation: and divide the spoils between the warriors who went out to battle, and between all the congregation: and you shall set apart a tribute for the Lord from the men of war who went out to battle, one soul out of five hundred, from the men, and from the cattle, and from the oxen, and from the sheep, and from the donkeys, and from the mules, and from all the beasts you shall take; and you shall give it to Eleazar the priest as the firstfruits of the Lord. And from the half of the children of Israel you shall take one portion out of fifty, from the men, and from the oxen, and from the sheep, and from the donkeys, and from all the beasts; and you shall give them to the Levites who keep the guards of the tabernacle of the Lord. And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses."<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup> For immediately what was commanded by the divine oracle was performed. Therefore, when the most minute and most diligent numbering of the spoils was made, and the distribution of the half; and when the separations or firstfruits of the Lord were given to the priest Eleazar, I say, and to the Levites; are you minded to be so mindful as to overcome forgetfulness, and to be able to recur to that which we were saying at the beginning?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What is that?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For did not the sacred Scriptures record that a thousand from each tribe assembled for waging war?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> They indeed recorded it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Were we not saying openly and manifestly that the splendor and praise of one part would pertain to the whole fullness? God's kindness and mercy wisely administering this also in us, so that as one most fragrant incense, made from various spices, the one odor of all is offered to God, and that which is not so approved acquires praise together with the most approved part.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is so. For our discussion had undertaken to investigate this very thing.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> See therefore God openly commanding this same thing to the children of Israel: for those chosen soldiers, a thousand from each tribe, contended against the Midianites; and when they had undoubtedly obtained the victory by labor and sweat, they immediately divided what they had collected from the war with the whole synagogue, and the rest of the multitude was honored by the glorious deeds of those strong men: "For you shall divide," he says, "the spoils, you and Eleazar the priest, and the chief of the fathers of the synagogue, and you shall divide the spoils between the warriors who went out to the fight, and the whole congregation."<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup> Moreover, that praise will be attained together with the chosen and illustrious men also by those who are somewhat lacking in virtue, and follow their nobility of soul from behind, the blessed Paul also indicated covertly. For when he had enumerated those ancient and holy men who had been commended by faith, and who had acquired illustrious glory for themselves by their excellent piety towards God, he says: "These all died in faith, and did not receive the promises, God having provided some better thing for us, that they should not be perfected without us."<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup> He also writes to others: "You are already perfect, without us you have reigned, and I would that you did reign, that we also might reign with you."<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup> You see that those who are of an inferior order will be perfected together with the perfect; and they are blessed together with the chosen men, who are not equally strong in powers. For the blessed David sings: "Blessed are you by the Lord, who made heaven and earth; the Lord blessed the house of Aaron; the Lord blessed the house of Israel; the Lord blessed them that fear him, the small with the great."<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup> For together with the great are blessed those who are called small, who cannot boast of equal fortitude, and who are inferior in alacrity of soul for enduring labors, but perhaps equal in zeal and faith, and by the strengths according to their ability gladden Christ. And Moses and Eleazar not absurdly hold the figure of Christ, who is both priest and lawgiver, and distributes the spoils to the people, with the holy angels standing by at the same time, whose care those chief fathers of the synagogue bear. Or do you not think that there are many holy angels on earth appointed by God to bring help to the faithful, and to govern, so to speak, peoples?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I indeed confess it: for why should I deny it?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Christ is expected to come from heaven with the holy angels; and he will sit on the throne of his glory, and will distribute worthy rewards to each, and will repay honors according to the account of rightly performed deeds. Therefore that wise Isaiah says concerning Christ: "Therefore he shall have dominion over many, and shall divide the spoils of the strong, because his soul was delivered to death, and he was numbered with the transgressors."<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup> Therefore, the distribution of rewards will be through Christ, who is prefigured as in Moses and Eleazar. For Christ is both lawgiver and high priest.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very well said.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But if the very manner observed in distributing is considered, will it not be judged most worthy of admiration?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Certainly indeed: for in equal share, those who fought and those who remained at rest are honored.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> By no means equally, by no means, I say; although the fighting men had the half of the whole prey, but the other half the whole synagogue: for the whole number of the children of Israel was six hundred thousand, plus three thousand five hundred and fifty, the sum of the sacred tribe being separate and taken out of this number. But the number most fit for battle was no more than a thousand from each tribe. Therefore, the spoils being distributed into which portions, and each multitude receiving the half of the whole, the fewer had the honors in much more, and not the more numerous and superior in number. Therefore, whatever that glory and measure of the heavenly gift is, which will be given to the whole people in its times, the accurate half, so to speak, of it will be distributed to the chosen, who show themselves worthy of the divine inspection; but the other half being given to the whole multitude, although that multitude is so much superior in number: "For many are called, but few are chosen."<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup> For the word is deep. Or have we not understood what I say? For it is somewhat obscure.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I understand. For even if we will be partakers of the glory of the saints, yet certainly in lesser things than they; for your discourse hints this to us not obscurely.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You have spoken rightly. But observe besides this another thing, in which you can easily see especially the confidence in God of the brave men.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What do you say?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For he commanded that the twelve thousand warriors should bring from the half of the whole that was allotted to them, one soul from five hundred, both from the men and from the cattle, to the high priest; and this was the tax to be paid by them to the Lord. But he commanded the other multitude to set apart one soul from fifty, from the men, and from the oxen, and from the sheep, and from the donkeys, and from all the cattle, for the sacred tribe. Since therefore Eleazar in himself figures him who is one and alone truly the high priest, that is, Christ, to him especially and truly, and as it were directly and properly, the gifts of the chosen men are consecrated: for they are offered to him, no other who receives being interposed; which thing those blessed disciples did; and the leaders of the peoples do even now, making the labors undertaken in the divine preaching a kind of offering dedicated to Christ. But the other multitude of the approved men indeed makes offerings to the glory of Christ, yet through the interposition of the saints, understood as in the sacred tribe; for it has been said: "A chosen generation, a royal priesthood."<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup> Therefore, through the interposition of the saints, their reverence and worship towards God is exhibited, bearing fruit indeed, yet not making their offering properly and directly to the person of Christ, such as those endeavored to perform who were collecting the so-called collections, and sending ministries to the saints in Jerusalem, or by whatever other service they were refreshing those dedicated to God.<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup> Therefore, the gifts of the more excellent are a proper offering to God; but the offering of the inferior also pertains to the same through the saints as through a middle hand, and holds a second place, as it were. Moreover, the former offer one soul from five hundred, the latter from fifty: for the approved owe less; and therefore their offering is less: but the inferior owe much more, and therefore the things brought by them are in a greater number, proportionally to the offenses of each, their offerings are made for them: "For to whom more is forgiven," he says, "he will love more; and to whom less is forgiven, he will love less."<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup> Therefore they offer ten times more than those chosen ones, who are by no means equal to them in virtue; not because they are more religious and live more laudably, but because they are held bound by many more faults, and need far greater purification than they. For as the Savior says: "He who is washed does not need except to wash his feet; but is clean all over."<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup> But holy men need little purification; for human nature labors with this disease, that it cannot be entirely without sin.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Those chosen men from the tribes, having obeyed the divine laws, divided the booty of the war with the whole synagogue, and offered offerings to God, as was established by law: but indeed the leaders of the chosen, as they were more illustrious in glory than the others, venerate God also with more excellent gifts. For thus it writes again: "And all the counselors in the office of the army, the officers over thousands and hundreds, came to Moses, and said to Moses: Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are with us, and not one is missing from them, and we have offered a gift to the Lord, what every man has found of vessels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make atonement for our souls before the Lord. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all wrought vessels, and all the gold of the separation which they separated for the Lord, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the tribunes and from the centurions. And the men of war took the booty each for himself. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the tribunes and the centurions, and brought them into the tabernacle of the testimony, a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup> Do you hear how diligently he says the fighters were counted, so that no one was absent, but each brought a gift, as it had pleased God? They also say that they determined to offer to the Lord even what he had not commanded to be offered, namely, chains, and bracelets, and the ring, and the other ornaments wrought of gold. For the lawgiver had commanded that they should take gifts from the men and from the cattle, and these had now been offered, as had been commanded by the divine and heavenly precept: but besides these, they offer voluntary gifts from the principal things which they had from the booty, the leaders of the chosen soldiers, and they surpass the prescribed limit of the law by their magnificence. And so, when Moses and Aaron had received them, they brought them into the holy tabernacle, and took care that they were stored up as memorials before the Lord; for those who are set over the peoples, and constituted as princes, honor God with more illustrious and distinguished gifts, and offer to him the variety of virtue as a kind of ornament and dedicate it: and when they themselves transcend the very measure of the law, they obtain more illustrious praise. These owe far more: hence it also happens that the things which are offered by them are greater in number; since indeed, according to the measure of each one's offenses, gifts are also offered for the same: "For to whom more is forgiven," he says, "he will love more; and to whom less is forgiven, he will love less."<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup> Therefore they offer ten times more than those chosen ones, who are by no means equal to them in virtue; not because they are more religious and live more laudably, but because they are held bound by many more faults, and need far greater purification than they. For as the Savior says: "He who is washed does not need except to wash his feet; but is clean all over."<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup> But holy men need little purification; for human nature labors with this disease, that it cannot be entirely without sin.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Those chosen men from the tribes, having obeyed the divine laws, divided the booty of the war with the whole synagogue, and offered offerings to God, as was established by law: but indeed the leaders of the chosen, as they were more illustrious in glory than the others, venerate God also with more excellent gifts. For thus it writes again: "And all the counselors in the office of the army, the officers over thousands and hundreds, came to Moses, and said to Moses: Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are with us, and not one is missing from them, and we have offered a gift to the Lord, what every man has found of vessels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make atonement for our souls before the Lord. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all wrought vessels, and all the gold of the separation which they separated for the Lord, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the tribunes and from the centurions. And the men of war took the booty each for himself. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the tribunes and the centurions, and brought them into the tabernacle of the testimony, a memorial for the children of Israel before the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup> Do you hear how diligently he says the fighters were counted, so that no one was absent, but each brought a gift, as it had pleased God? They also say that they determined to offer to the Lord even what he had not commanded to be offered, namely, chains, and bracelets, and the ring, and the other ornaments wrought of gold. For the lawgiver had commanded that they should take gifts from the men and from the cattle, and these had now been offered, as had been commanded by the divine and heavenly precept: but besides these, they offer voluntary gifts from the principal things which they had from the booty, the leaders of the chosen soldiers, and they surpass the prescribed limit of the law by their magnificence. And so, when Moses and Aaron had received them, they brought them into the holy tabernacle, and took care that they were stored up as memorials before the Lord; for those who are set over the peoples, and constituted as princes, honor God with more illustrious and distinguished gifts, and offer to him the variety of virtue as a kind of ornament and dedicate it: and when they themselves transcend the very measure of the law, they obtain more illustrious praise.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What then is that truly like?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Christ appointed that those who announce the Gospel should live from the Gospel: he also took care to confirm this very thing by the precept of the law. Paul, when he writes, now indeed: "Those who eat of the sacrifices are partakers of the altar"<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup>; now again, when he shows that this is entirely free from blame by necessary examples, saying: "Who plants a vineyard, and does not eat of its fruit? Who feeds a flock, and does not drink of the milk of the flock? Do I say these things according to man? Does not the law also say this? For it is written in the law of Moses: You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain. Is it for the oxen that God cares? Or does he say this altogether for our sake? For it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes, in hope of partaking."<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup> Then, having said these things, he immediately adds: "If we have sown spiritual things for you, is it a great thing if we reap your carnal things? If others partake of this power over you, do not we rather? But we have not used this power; but we bear all things, lest we should give any hindrance to the Gospel of Christ."<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup> Then again he confirms: "What then is my reward? That, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel without charge."<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup> You see therefore how, beyond what Christ and the ancient law had established, although he had the ability to live from the Gospel, yet he places the Gospel without charge; and this deed is consecrated to God as a kind of voluntary gift. Concerning the not taking of a wife, neither the old law nor the recent preaching of the Gospel has sanctioned anything for us. Therefore Paul says: "Concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup> But those who are very strenuous in the pursuit of piety, mortify and put to death the flesh. And so they offer continence, which is beyond the law, as a clear gift to God, and a life excellently composed in word and deed, as an ornament skillfully wrought. Moreover, Moses and Aaron brought into the holy tabernacle the things which had been offered: for the deeds of strong men are pleasing to Christ, and therefore as excellent and splendid ornaments, through which they obtain to be consecrated to a lasting, indeed eternal, memory; and they show themselves such as to be deemed worthy of divine inspection: for, that it is said that the gifts were placed in the sight of the Lord, signifies something of this kind. Truly it is great and excellent to be placed, as it were, in the eyes of God: for he esteems most highly those whom he deigns to look upon.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It seems therefore to be signified to us with many words, that we ought to be so persuaded and to think, that this very thing, to offer gifts to God, belongs not more to others than to those who bear themselves strenuously and bravely, and often procure praise for themselves from right deeds.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Well done, Palladius, for you think rightly; and not only does the matter itself stand so, but it is also confirmed by the testimony of Sacred Scripture. For when God wished to erect that sacred tabernacle, while the sons of Israel were still dwelling in the wilderness, which would bear the figure and image of the Church gathered from the Gentiles, he commanded that those who were zealous for that work should be gathered. And so he thus addressed Moses, the interpreter of the sacred things: "If you take the sum of the children of Israel, in their numbering they shall give each one the price of the redemption of his soul to the Lord, and there shall be no plague among them in their numbering; and this is what they shall give, everyone who passes over to the inspection, half a shekel, according to the holy shekel (the shekel has twenty obols), and the half shekel shall be the offering to the Lord. Everyone who passes over to the inspection, from twenty years old and above, shall give the offering to the Lord. The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than the half shekel, when they give the offering to the Lord to make atonement for your souls: and you shall take the silver of the offering from the children of Israel, and you shall give it for the service of the tabernacle of the testimony; and it shall be for the children of Israel a memorial before the Lord, to make atonement for your souls."<sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup> Behold, the lawgiver says that a diligent numbering must again be made, and he commanded that gifts should be brought to the Lord, half a shekel. But who they are who ought to offer, he openly defines; for God did not permit women to do this, nor yet boys: in which, unless I am mistaken, he disapproved of the unwarlike and soft, and those who are less perfect in prudence: and he enrolled in the number of the offerers the adult and vigorous young man, and he who passes over to the inspection, to whom he prescribes the twentieth year of age. For only those are worthy to offer gifts to the Lord according to the prescription of the law, who transcend childish sense and a womanish spirit, and have now arrived at the measure of a man, since they are full and complete with that age which is understood in Christ and is spiritual. These pass over to the inspection, that is, they show themselves worthy to be in the eyes of God, as is sung in the Psalms: "The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous."<sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup> Moreover, those prices of redemption were offered for the salvation of the offerers, and for the works of the holy tabernacle, and as a memorial before the Lord: for the excellent deeds of holy men constitute churches, and are useful for the ornament of the sacred tabernacle, and at the same time effect the salvation of the soul, and eternal glories crown the brave men. Do we seem to you to speak insufficiently truly?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> To me indeed most truly.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> God therefore commanded that the price of redemption or the shekel should be exacted as a kind of census, and that was their tribute, who had come to manly age. But indeed the princes of the tribes added to those things which were prescribed in the law, and offered certain greater and more precious things, namely from those principal things which they had with them. For it is written: "The princes offered emerald stones, and stones of perfection for the ephod, and the breastplate, and the compositions, and the oil of unction, and the composition of incense."<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup> Do not these things agree with those which were said a little before? For that multitude of fighters offered to God from the booty, as was commanded, from the man even to the beast: but the tribunes and centurions added to these the chain, and the bracelet, and the necklace, and the ring, and every vessel of gold skillfully wrought, which the priest Eleazar also stored up in the very holy tabernacle. And here again, when indeed the whole multitude of adults paid the shekel, the princes offer chosen stones for making the ephod and the breastplate, which pertain to the ornament of the high priest. For the leaders of the peoples offer themselves, to be an ornament to Christ, just as certain precious stones. Therefore the prophet, when he indicates the holy apostles to us, says: "The holy stones are rolled upon the earth,"<sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup> such as was the blessed Paul, who went about from Jerusalem even to Illyricum for the sake of preaching.<sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup> The precious stones, therefore, and prepared for the glory of Christ, are the assembly of holy men: they are also the oil of unction, and the composition of incense, when they breathe the knowledge of Christ as a fragrance, and make the minds of those who are imbued with the mysteries richer, as it were, with doctrine and the words of the Holy Spirit as with oil. But that incense was composite; for that knowledge of Christ is composite from two things: for he is both God and man; yet one Son and Christ from both, to whom certainly it is said, and indeed by us ourselves: "Your name is ointment poured forth."<sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup></p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, those who are fit and firm for fighting are in the inspection of God, and the constitution of the churches is also from their fruits, and those things which pertain to the glory of God. For the passages of Scripture proposed for contemplation seem to bear this in themselves.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You speak rightly. But that a distinguished and preeminent lot, and the communication of every good, is bestowed by God upon those who are accustomed to bear themselves so excellently, how or from where can anyone be able to doubt? And do you not hear David singing in harmony: "You shall eat the labors of your hands"?<sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup> Likewise Paul, that wise and sacred man, writing thus: "For whatever a man sows, that he will also reap"?<sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup></p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I hear indeed.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For no one will bear himself bravely, with no reward proposed; and without doubt he is entirely true who says: "For God is not unjust, so as to forget your work, and the love which you have shown towards his name."<sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup> And indeed he will not forget me; but that he will bestow rewards upon those who have overcome the languor of soul leading to sin, the things which are again written in Numbers are an argument: "And the Lord spoke to Moses and Eleazar the priest, saying: Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel from twenty years old and above, according to the house of their fathers: all who go out to fight in Israel ..."<sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup> Then, after the enumeration by peoples and tribes, he adds again: "And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: To these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names: to the more you shall give the greater inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the lesser inheritance; to each one, as they have been numbered, shall his inheritance be given: the land shall be divided by lot according to the names; according to the tribes of their families they shall receive the inheritance: by lot you shall divide their inheritance between the many and the few."<sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup> And this indeed is the law, by which those who were now in their twentieth year were to possess the inheritance by lot. After the numbering therefore of the common crowd, he numbers the Levitical race: "And the sons," he says, "of Levi according to their peoples: Gershon the people of the Gershonites, Kohath the people of the Kohathites, Merari the people of the Merarites: these are the peoples of the sons of Levi."<sup><a href="#fn92" id="ref92">92</a></sup> Among these, when he had numbered the family of Moses and Aaron, he adds again concerning the sons of Levi: "And they were from their numbering twenty-three thousand: every male from one month old and above: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel; because no lot was given to them in the midst of the children of Israel. And this is the numbering of Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan, opposite Jericho. And among these there was not a man of those who had been numbered by Moses and Aaron, whom they had numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai; because the Lord said to them: They shall die by death in the wilderness; and there was not left of them even one, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun."<sup><a href="#fn93" id="ref93">93</a></sup> Come therefore, again going over each part briefly and in parts, let us speak more clearly and distinctly.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Speak therefore without delay; for in matters of this kind it is pleasant to discourse shrewdly.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, bringing the proposed words into a brief summary, we say this: God again commands that the adult and not inexperienced age for war be numbered. For as we have already said before, they are known and described before God, and enrolled in the book of the living, not the unwarlike and weak, nor those still boys in understanding, but all who are strong and prepared to wage war with vices and sin, and are firm and established in wisdom, and are now fit to do and accomplish those things which God would wish: these same ones divided the land by tribes, and by name, and individually. For heirs of the holy land, and partakers of the hoped-for goods, will be those of whom we speak, by tribes and families, as in those words: "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth; blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy"<sup><a href="#fn94" id="ref94">94</a></sup>; and in the other beatitudes also it can be seen: for the inheritance of the merciful, and of the poor in spirit, and of those who suffer persecution for righteousness' sake, is, as it were, proper to them. But yet to each one also according to his name a crown of glory will be given, when God renders honors to each according to the account of right deeds, and adds grace to the brave men by supplying what was lacking; although this perhaps is to be understood as distributed with a greater and more abundant measure: "For a good measure," he says, "and pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, they will give into your bosom"<sup><a href="#fn95" id="ref95">95</a></sup>: and this very thing, I think, is signified when God says: "To the more you shall give the greater inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the lesser inheritance: to each one, as they have been numbered, shall his inheritance be given."<sup><a href="#fn96" id="ref96">96</a></sup> For that greater number of names is an open figure of more excellent and superior virtue; for this one thus, that one indeed thus, deserves the same, as the blessed Paul says.<sup><a href="#fn97" id="ref97">97</a></sup> But the land is divided by lot, perhaps for that reason which is said to God: "In your hands are my lots."<sup><a href="#fn98" id="ref98">98</a></sup> For by divine judgment will be made the firm distribution of future goods, when, what it is fitting to bestow upon each, he will determine at that time, to whom all our things are known. Moreover, again the enumeration of the Levites is made separately, from one month old and above; and no lot is given to them in the midst of the children of Israel, nor are they numbered with them. For that race is always holier, more sacred than the others. And therefore their description is separate from the other tribes, and their lot is not mixed with the others; but they have both their own inspection and numbering, and indeed their part and lot is God himself of all, according to that: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."<sup><a href="#fn99" id="ref99">99</a></sup> For while those who are called poor in spirit will possess the kingdom of heaven; and those who have proposed to mourn will have consolation; and those who have been merciful will obtain mercy: Blessed, he says, are the pure in heart, for they shall see God; these indeed are they who are held more sacred and holy beyond all others, and that excellent vision of God is appointed as their lot and part, that is, the knowledge of the divinity itself. This very thing Christ promised he would bestow upon the holy apostles, when he said: "These things I have spoken to you in proverbs; the hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in proverbs, but will announce to you plainly concerning the Father."<sup><a href="#fn100" id="ref100">100</a></sup> Moreover, the description of the sacred men is made from one month old, as I just said: for from that number of the more sacred, not only those are described in the book of God who excel in spiritual strengths, and are more famous for the name of wisdom, but also all who have embraced that simplicity which is according to Christ, and are little ones in malice. Therefore that more sacred race is wholly described, namely both those who excel in wisdom, and those who excel in simplicity. It is easy, Palladius, to perceive such a distinction in the souls, senses, and morals of the saints. God also added, that there was no one of those who had been numbered before by Moses and Aaron, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai, because the Lord said to them: They shall die by death in the wilderness, and there was not left of them even one, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun<sup><a href="#fn101" id="ref101">101</a></sup>: in which he clearly shows that the distribution of possessions does not pertain to the unbelievers, and that description in the book of God, but rather it befits those who have sincerely embraced faith in Christ: for concerning the unbelievers the divine David says: "Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous."<sup><a href="#fn102" id="ref102">102</a></sup> In which words also the divine discourse secretly shows us that grace is given to believers: and therefore Scripture says mystically that the description was made near the Jordan; for he is described who has been baptized. Nor yet has the whole Israel fallen from hope. For there is a remnant, according to the voice of the prophet<sup><a href="#fn103" id="ref103">103</a></sup>: of which thing Caleb and Joshua bear the figure, alone left out of all, who would enjoy that hereditary lot, and would be described together with those who were not held by the crime of unbelief. Observe, however, everywhere the description of holy men and the distribution of lands: for it is done through Moses and him who performed the most excellent priesthood, so that, as I have already said before, you may understand through both the one Christ, as the high priest and lawgiver; through whom every grace is bestowed, and that description is made in the heavenly books. Which also the blessed Daniel says he saw. "The books," he says, "were opened"<sup><a href="#fn104" id="ref104">104</a></sup>: for because the description is multiple and diverse, therefore there are several, not one book.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Rightly therefore and shrewdly that saying from Proverbs admonishes: "The slothful become needy; but the strenuous are sustained by riches."<sup><a href="#fn105" id="ref105">105</a></sup></p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> They indeed are sustained, and have God as their protector and defender, who increases them with those heavenly blessings, and crowns them, and most amply adorns them with most splendid honors and distinguished glory. Do you think it less true, when he says: "As I live, says the Lord, those who glorify me I will glorify"?<sup><a href="#fn106" id="ref106">106</a></sup></p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Indeed very much so.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But certainly he brings to perfection the things which pertain to the glory of God, I think, whoever is strenuous, and has cultivated spiritual fortitude, and has been exercised to resist the visible and invisible enemies, and knows how to preserve both himself and others, and has been able to do all things in God.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I agree.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do you wish therefore to contemplate this very thing in those things which are narrated concerning the blessed Abraham for our greatest benefit, as if sketched lightly on a certain tablet?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I would indeed most willingly; why not?</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is written therefore, that Lot dwelt and lived in Sodom<sup><a href="#fn107" id="ref107">107</a></sup>; but when a severe and harsh war invaded that region, and the neighboring nations and those from the region of the Euphrates, together with their leaders, had taken the city by force, Lot was carried away together with those who had been taken captive, and together with the others he was taken captive. When someone of those who had escaped came, "It was announced," he says, "to Abraham the sojourner; but he himself was dwelling by the oak of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner, who were confederates with Abraham. And Abraham hearing that Lot his brother's son had been taken captive, numbered his own home-born servants, three hundred and eighteen. And he pursued after them as far as Dan, and he fell upon them at night, he and his servants. And he struck them, and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is on the left of Damascus. And he brought back all the cavalry of the Sodomites, and Lot his brother's son he brought back, and all his substance, and the women, and the people. The king of Sodom went out to meet him, after he returned from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and the kings who were with him, to the valley of Shaveh. This was the plain of the kings. And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; and he was a priest of God most high; and he blessed Abraham, and said: Blessed be Abraham of God most high, who created heaven and earth; and blessed be God most high, who has delivered your enemies into your hand. And he gave him a tenth of all. And the king of Sodom said to Abraham: Give me the men, but take the cavalry for yourself. But Abraham said to the king of Sodom: I have lifted up my hand to the Lord God most high, who created heaven and earth, if from a thread to a shoelace I take anything of all that is yours, lest you say, I have enriched Abraham; except what the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, Mamre; let them take their portion. And after these words the word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision, saying: Do not fear, Abraham; I am your protector, your reward shall be very great. And Abraham said: Lord God, what will you give me? And I am going childless; and the son of Masek, my home-born maid, this Eliezer of Damascus. And Abraham said: Since you have not given me seed, my home-born servant will be my heir. And immediately a voice of the Lord came to him, saying: This one shall not be your heir; but he who shall come out of you, he shall be your heir. And he brought him outside, and said to him: Look up to heaven, and count the stars, if you are able to number them. And he said: So shall your seed be."<sup><a href="#fn108" id="ref108">108</a></sup> Do you see the readiness of the saints for boldness, and how they have the voluntary endurance of hardships? For as soon as he heard that Lot was in danger, immediately pitying the calamity of his relative, and seizing the home-born servants and some of the confederates, he quickly set out against those who had inflicted the grief, and subdued them without any difficulty, and freed from captivity both his brother's son Lot, and also those who had come into the hands of the victors. Then, to show due honor to the victor, the king of Sodom came out to meet him, and also the priest of God most high, Melchizedek, as it is written; and he was by no means empty-handed; for he brought the symbols of that which was then in use for a priest, namely bread and wine, and he blessed Abraham, and bestowed upon him the sacred words in place of a reward. Abraham therefore strenuously managed the affair and conquered: for such almost always are those brave men according to Christ, who bear in mind that most pleasing confidence and alacrity of soul conceived in the mind. And to make faith in the words by way of example, I will add the holy apostles, who, when Satan easily snatched away all things, and those who resisted the true doctrine were plundering the souls of simpler men, opposed themselves bravely, and armed with them the home-born servants, that is, those who were educated in the Sacred Letters; also certain confederates who were not Hebrews, namely those who, although they still savored the things of the world, nevertheless entered the contest together with the holy men, and strove to imitate them. And so, when they had borne themselves strenuously, they produced victory, and snatched captives from that tyrannical dominion: for they save some from the worship of idols, and the adoration of the creature rather than the Creator, others drawn out from the knowledge of a false name. But from this so illustrious and lofty magnanimity of soul they obtain that reward, that they are not only honored by those who are in the world: "For the king of Sodom," it says, "went out to meet Abraham"<sup><a href="#fn109" id="ref109">109</a></sup>; but they also obtain that blessing which is given through Christ, who gladdens us with life-giving grace as with bread and wine. Therefore they most truly say of themselves: "Blessed are we by the Lord, who made heaven and earth."<sup><a href="#fn110" id="ref110">110</a></sup> Moreover, Melchizedek is a figure of the priesthood of Christ; nor will there be need, I think, of many things to demonstrate this matter; since the Sacred Letters are sufficient in this part. But when the king of Sodom said to the blessed Abraham as to a victor: Give me the men, but take the horses for yourself; he immediately swore that he would receive nothing, except perhaps the food of those who had undertaken the labor with him, and the portion of the confederates Eshcol, Aner, and Mamre. For although the holy men wage war and strive strenuously for the salvation of the men who have perished, and undergo every labor: yet they receive nothing from the world. And they do not collect earthly riches: in which they especially avoid that reproach which is wont to arise from that: "Lest you say," he says, "That I have enriched Abraham"; they will only receive the food which is supplied by those whom they have helped. "For the laborer is worthy of his reward"<sup><a href="#fn111" id="ref111">111</a></sup>, and Christ commanded that those who announce the Gospel should live from the Gospel.<sup><a href="#fn112" id="ref112">112</a></sup> But the confederates receive portions, because, I think, in those things also which pertain to the present life, the emulators and imitators of the holy men are blessed by God: for good things abound to them, acquired according to the just reason and way of their condition; for to those who have not yet perfectly withdrawn from earthly things, and are in a certain way divided between God and the world, God also bestows earthly blessings. Thus he blessed Jacob when he multiplied his cattle.<sup><a href="#fn113" id="ref113">113</a></sup></p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Now indeed, with so great praise and splendor having been obtained, that author of salvation says that his cultivators must by no means grow sluggish; and he opportunely promises that they will also receive no small reward: in which at the same time he repels as far as possible from the flock of those who fear him the affection of cowardice and sloth of soul, and sharpens them to alacrity of soul by the hope of the things which he promises, and makes them stronger: and therefore also the blessed Paul, because he was so affected, sometimes says: "I can do all things in him who strengthens me, Christ"<sup><a href="#fn114" id="ref114">114</a></sup>; sometimes again: "I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness."<sup><a href="#fn115" id="ref115">115</a></sup> Come now, Abraham is greatly distressed in mind because he had a home-born son, and was going without children: For what, he says, will you give me, if I am sent away childless?<sup><a href="#fn116" id="ref116">116</a></sup> And he considers that he has no fruit, just as if he were barren. Then God promises that a son will be from the free woman, that is Isaac, and in him that he will be the father of many nations, and his seed will be as the stars of heaven: for the holy apostle was grieved that they had a spurious fruit, as it were from a certain bondwoman, namely from the legal worship; and they were seeking a son rather from the free woman, that is, from the New Testament; but that was Christ, in whose figure also Isaac is understood to be born through the promise and through faith. Therefore the blessed Paul says concerning the ornaments of the law, which were in him: "What things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ; but indeed I count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ, and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ Jesus."<sup><a href="#fn117" id="ref117">117</a></sup> In Christ, indeed, the fathers of many nations and of innumerable seed, as Abraham was in Isaac, are made. But what has been said by us concerning this matter, we attribute not only to those ancient men and the holy apostles, but we also refer it to those who after them have obtained the priestly office, and have been constituted leaders of the Church, or even to any holy and upright man.</p>
