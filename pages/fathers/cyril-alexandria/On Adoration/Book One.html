        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Where then and from what point do you think we should begin? For I suppose it is superfluous to ask. For you would say, I well know, without hesitation, as from home and as it is with us.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> True.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> What is this in your hands, then, if you please?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> An Evangelical book, the writing of Matthew and John.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And to what end and for whom do you think it ought to be used? For surely you would not practice it while going abroad, O Palladius. Rather, the labors are sweeter at home and in leisure.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak well. I will read it for you. And I bring the sacred book; for though I have toiled over countless things, I can conceive of nothing that our Lord Jesus Christ might more clearly declare, on the one hand in Matthew, saying: "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> And in the writing according to John, to the woman from Samaria: "Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> What then seems to you to be the difficulty in these passages? What is the deep and hard-to-reach meaning? Tell me as I ask.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> The sacred word commands us to depart from the ancient customs and abandon the righteousness of the Law. And Paul said to those who were eager for it even after faith: "You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness."<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> And again, showing us the polity according to the Law, and indeed splendid and great boasts concerning himself, he says: "Whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God."<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> And he clearly affirmed that the old commandment was not blameless. For this reason, he says, that useful new commandment through Christ, that is, the evangelical one, has been introduced to us. He writes thus: "For on the one hand, there is a setting aside of the former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness (for the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God."<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> And again: "For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second."<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> For rebuking them, he says: "Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt. For they did not continue in my covenant, and so I showed no concern for them, declares the Lord. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws into their minds, and write them on their hearts."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> And understanding and interpreting the name "new" excellently: "In speaking of a new covenant," he says, "he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away."<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> If, therefore, the Law perfected nothing, and there has been a setting aside of the old commandment and an introduction of a second, which brings us near to God, what then does the Savior mean when he says, "I have not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it,"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> and that "We ought to worship God the Father in spirit and truth"?<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> For he indicates, I think, this: that we must cease from the customs and worship according to the law.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You have launched into a wide sea of questions! For what mind will suffice to weave skillfully into such subtle contemplations, as to show that the new Scripture is a sister and neighbor, so to speak, going through the same matters as those decreed long ago through the all-wise Moses, and that the life in Christ is not very far removed from the legal polity, if one leads the things decreed for the ancients to spiritual contemplation? For the law is a type and shadow, and the form of piety is as yet in labor, having the beauty of truth hidden within itself. Will you not say that this is as I have said?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Certainly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But what could be the clarification of this? Or what is the manner of living evangelically while seeming to have risen above the old commandment, and thinking to fulfill the things through Moses?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The matter is not simple, as one might suppose. Virtue is, I think, a thing of many branches and manifold forms; and the boasts of the polity in Christ are embellished for us with the greatest variety of good works. And indeed, the divine David presents to us in the forty-fourth psalm the Church as a pure virgin, as in the order of a queen, standing before Christ, and he puts upon her a robe embroidered with gold and varied colors, saying thus: "The queen stands at your right hand, arrayed in robes of gold, adorned with variety."<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> The gold, I think, signifies the honorable and splendid; the variety, the manifold forms of virtue. For the Church is most beautiful, having an intelligible adornment, seen not with the eyes of the flesh, but within the mind and heart, the hidden Jew understood in secret,<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> manifesting gracefully a broad and excellent array through very many beautifications. For as the blessed Paul writes: "For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God."<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Tell me then, since the circumcision of the spirit has been introduced, and the sacrifices according to the law have been overturned, and the polity has no place among us, does it not seem somehow implausible to say that Christ "has not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it"? Or if it is not so, would nothing, I suppose, prevent us also from honoring the God of all with animal sacrifices and incense, and offering to him turtledoves and pigeons, and whatever else has been customary for the ancients, and hastening to fulfill this ourselves?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Truly, O friend, you are carried far from what is fitting. For you think the law has been overturned, as if it has profited nothing and has a completely useless signification for any necessary thing, rather than having been transformed into a demonstration of truth, even though the blessed Paul writes: "Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law."<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> For the law is a pedagogue,<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> and leads well to the mystery in Christ. And we say that the things decreed long ago through Moses for the ancients are the elementary principles of the beginning of the oracles of God.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> But if we spurn the pedagogue, who will still bring us to the mystery of Christ? And if we refuse to learn the elementary principles of the beginning of the oracles of God, how then, or from where, shall we arrive at the end? For is not Christ the fulfillment of the law and the prophets?<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Yes.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For it is written thus. And "fulfillment of the law and the prophets" would be, I suppose, that every prophetic and legal decree looks and is directed towards him. Therefore, reproaching the disobedience of the Jews, he said: "Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope. For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> If then he said he came, not at all to abolish the law, but rather to bring it to completion, do not think he intended the complete overthrow of the things decreed of old; but rather a kind of reshaping and, so to speak, re-engraving of the things in types into truth.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You have spoken rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And such indeed was fitting to be done by Christ. Those who have practiced the skill of painting on tablets and in writings, not beginning to write immediately, apply the complete and fully finished form to their writings, first sketching very well in a preliminary and less beautiful color, and perhaps first revealing the outlines still rather faintly, then painting over the sketches, transferring the outlines into the manifest form, and incomparably better than at the beginning. Is it not so?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I say it is.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And those who practice the craft of metalworking, if they wish to cast a statue, first form it in wax into a lifeless shape, then melting it with fire, they pour in the bronze, and thus bring the crafted work to its proper form and beauty. And when the variety of colors is applied to the sketches, and moreover the bronze melts the wax, the first and initial shapes might seem to have been set aside and overturned. But the matter is not so by nature. For the metalworker and the painter would say truthfully: "We have not destroyed the sketches; we have not sent the outlines into complete uselessness; rather, we have fulfilled them. For what was to be seen as still in sketches and types, more obscure and less beautiful, this has advanced to the better and more manifest."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak well.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And if anyone chooses to investigate truly the sacred and God-inspired Scripture, he will know certainly that what I say is true. For Moses used to put a veil over his face, because the sons of Israel could not gaze at his face, according to what is written.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And what does this signify?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For to the minds of the Jews, which were still rather dense, the external aspects of the law—I mean again those through the letter alone—were somehow bearable, but the things hidden within, and so to speak the true face of the meanings, were utterly unbearable and not to be approached. Therefore the divine Paul writes for us: "For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away. Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts."<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> But so much for the Jews. "We all," he says, "with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit."<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> For just as those looking in a mirror see an image and type of the true thing, and not the truth itself, in the same way, I think, those desiring to see the beauty of the polity in Christ, using the law as a mirror, would achieve perfectly what is desired. For transforming the same image of things into truth, they will know purely what is most pleasing and acceptable to God.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Then what might be the reason that the new and evangelical oracle was not given to the ancients at the beginning, but rather types and shadows were legislated?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The exact nature of the dispensation, and how these things are, in truth, we must reverently ascribe to God who knows all things. But reasonings, not ignorant of good thoughts, bring us somehow at least to a moderate understanding, or perhaps even to a seeming knowledge of the purpose of the dispensation. We say, therefore, that much pedagogy and a kind of childlike upbringing was needed for those redeemed from Egypt. For they were still dense and very easily led astray to any of the most abhorrent things. And for those sick with a love of the flesh, very hard to wash away, and seized by passions difficult to escape, it was somehow unattainable and not yet ready to grasp the ability to leap immediately to the exceedingly excellent, as to choose a certain kind of life, perhaps so splendid and transcendent, as to walk on the earth but have their citizenship in heaven,<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> according to what is written. For is not solid food for the mature, but milk for infants more suitable?<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Quite so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> There was need, therefore, of pedagogy in types for infants, and so to speak, of a more tender upbringing, not of the word that directs to perfection and is able to bring to the perfect state. And the Israelites were so light-minded and of little understanding, and very prone to every passion, that if there were any exact testing of character and attempts among them, they would not, I think, be worthy even of a shadow. And Moses demonstrated this. For when God commanded, he himself went up on the mountain to receive the law. But they immediately slipped into apostasy. For they made a calf, and the wretches dared to say: "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt."<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> Therefore, at such terrible levity Moses was distressed and broke the tablets on which the law was, not thinking those to whom their mind was so stricken as to forget such wonders, which were accomplished for them by divine power, and to ascribe reverence again to a calf, and to come into remembrance of the worship in Egypt, worthy even of shadows or types, or indeed of any pedagogy from above. But then the law was sketched in shadow on stone tablets with the finger of God, as it is written.<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup> And those things were a type of what has been believed to happen among us in Christ. For the Master of all, God, writes the knowledge of his own counsel in us, as it were, using the Son as a pen in the Spirit. For he named him thus through David, saying: "My tongue is the pen of a ready scribe."<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup> For the pen of the Father, that is, the Son, engraved in the hearts of all the knowledge of every good, using as it were a certain finger of God, both that of the Father and his own Spirit. For he called the Spirit of God a finger, saying once: "But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons,"<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup> and again at another time: "But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons."<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> And Paul also called us the spiritual letter, saying: "You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, to be known and read by all. And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts."<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But that the things according to the law are types and shadows, I too would affirm, know well. Come then, applying a subtle and exact mind to the things prophesied in type, let us investigate very well the beauty of the truth. For thus henceforth the mystery of worship in spirit will be clear to none of those who are.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And indeed, O noble one, I am very reasonably afraid, and I am very reluctant for this. For such things, having a contemplation so lofty and transcendent, are, I suppose, not to be grasped by our people. And I think one must say, considering the depth of the contemplations in the law: "Who is wise and will understand these things? Who is intelligent and will know them?"<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> The matter is not easy, O friend. Yet Christ says: "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> We must go then to what is necessary to pursue for benefit; and indeed let us extend a supplication, saying: "Uncover my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law."<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> But it is necessary for us, as seems fit, before other things to speak of man's fall into depravity, concerning slavery and captivity under the enemy of all, how and in what manner these things are accomplished by us and in us. And then to speak accordingly, and in what manner one must turn away from evil, and shake off the yoke of slavery to it, and leap back to the original state, with God preserving and helping. For our discourse proceeding by this fitting path, the rest will also, I think, be appropriate.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You think most rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For to be able to bear fruit for God and to offer spiritual sacrifices, or rather to act manfully and to succeed, desiring to accomplish virtue, would surely not be fitting for those thus freed from slavery and the compulsion of passions, but for those whose mind has already in some way recovered to freedom, and does not have an unpracticed ability to shake off the yoke of the devil's tyranny.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I agree, for you think correctly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And so let us say that man was made in the beginning, having his mind still somewhat above sin and passions, yet not wholly incapable of turning to whatever he might choose. For it seemed right to the best Maker of all, God, to give him the reins of his own wills, and to permit him to do what seemed good by self-determined impulses. For virtue must be voluntary, and not seen as by necessity, nor yet deprived of the laws of nature without possibility of stumbling; for this would be the property of the highest essence and superiority. Since, then, the living creature was perfected by the working of God according to the principles of its own nature, it was immediately enriched with the likeness to Him. For the image of the divine nature was engraved upon it, the Holy Spirit having been breathed in. For that is the breath of life, since indeed God is life by nature.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Then did the divine Spirit become the soul for man?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And how is it not utterly absurd to think thus? For then the soul would be unchangeable, and it would have remained so; but now it is changeable. And the Spirit is not changeable. Or if changeability is a defect, would the blame ascend to the divine nature itself? If the Spirit is of God the Father, and indeed of the Son, substantially from both, that is, proceeding from the Father through the Son? It is ignorant, therefore, to think that the Spirit was transformed into a soul and passed over into human nature. But the fashioned creature was animated by ineffable power; and it was immediately adorned with the gift of the Spirit. For not otherwise could we possess the divine image.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak well.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Having adorned the workmanship, then, God granted the dwelling in paradise. But since it was necessary that one thus glorified and crowned with the abundance of heavenly goods should not be easily carried away to arrogance, ignorant of servitude and what is the measure of servile things (for excessive breadth towards glory and immoderate freedom lead to the haughty and accursed passion), a law of self-control was given to him as a pretext for not being ignorant of the Master; so that through it he might always be called to remembrance of Him who commanded with authority, and might know clearly that he is yoked to the ordinances of the Ruler. But that impious and God-hated beast did not remain quiet.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You would say, I suppose, Satan, who was cast down from the heavenly vault like lightning;<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup> for it seemed to him a boyish folly to wish to be God, and imagining things beyond his own nature, he fantasized.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You infer well. For being the inventor of envy and sin, and father, he did not wish to be inactive concerning the living being on earth, that is, man. Then by deceit and trickery he led him into disobedience, using the woman as an instrument of wickedness. For always in some way the pleasures with us and among us shake us towards the unseemly, that is, into sin; and woman is a type of pleasure. And the mind is often led by the flatteries from pleasures to the unwilling. What therefore happened in Adam as in a dense and perceptible mass of events, this one might see fulfilled in each of us, intellectually and hiddenly. For pleasure arising beforehand bewitches the mind, and little by little draws it to think henceforth that transgression of the divine law is absolutely nothing. And the disciple of Christ will confirm, saying: "Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am being tempted by God,' for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death."<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> The account is accurate.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Having sold, then, the grace from God, and being stripped already of the original goods, human nature was sent out from the paradise of delight, and was immediately transformed to ugliness, and having fallen into corruption henceforth was shown to be.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Necessarily. For lack of the gifts from God is nothing else than a falling away from every good. And human nature would fall sick very easily with a derangement to any of the extreme things, if the grace of the Preserver did not uphold it towards virtue, enriching it with the good things from above and from itself.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You speak well. For I would agree quite reasonably; for the living bread, that is, the word of God, nourishes into spiritual strength. For it is written: "And bread strengthens man's heart."<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> And it frees from slavery and passions, and gilds well with the boasts of freedom. But when God has withdrawn His hand, as it were, and does not distribute to us the supply in these things, every necessity somehow befalls us to fall into involuntary evils, and to slip away from all virtue, and to come under another yoke, so to speak, and to come to such evils and tyranny that we come near to losing even the very understanding that serves and is allied to us for every good, and to be shown utterly devoid of the wisdom according to God, the heart of the sufferer being, as it were, prostituted to Satan and easily subjected to the insults and licentiousness from him.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Would you show how, or will you leave it to float on bare reasonings?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Not at all. For I would show well how the things that happened to the ancients are skillfully formed into a type of the intelligible realities. For clear and very distinct images of things in subtle contemplation can be for us the things that signify as in sensation and as in visible form. It is written, then, concerning the patriarch Abraham: "Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land."<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> For leaving his beloved and native land, he moved to another, which God showed him. "Go from your country," He says, "and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you."<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> But when the famine weighed heavily, and brought a loss very difficult to escape, he was forced to see Egypt, and unwillingly. And he did not settle, but rather sojourned in it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What then is this?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It forms for us an excellent contemplation of the more hidden things.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> In what way?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Reproaching the disobedience of the Jews, God said somewhere: "Behold, days are coming when I will send a famine on the land—not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord. They shall wander from sea to sea, and from north to east; they shall run to and fro, to seek the word of the Lord, but they shall not find it."<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup> Is it not so, O friend, that those crushed by such a famine, and having fallen away from the supply that holds fast to virtue, and not having the nourishment from heaven and above, every necessity somehow makes the mind, like a migrant and exile, run about to baser things, and being thrust out from a certain native land of strength for virtue, to go down into another habit and will—no longer under God, but rather subject to diabolical scepters? For the father and king of sin, I think, who first brought it into the world, would one not receive Pharaoh, the ruler of the Egyptians, as an image and type, and very reasonably? Among whom the darkness of error was very deep; and no manner of wickedness was un-practiced.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And what grieved blessed Abraham from having come to the Egyptians?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Very much indeed. For he was brought to the brink of every evil. And you may learn this easily, from the holy Scripture speaking: "When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house."<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup> Consider then that his wife was nearly lost to him, O friend.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How sharp the matter, and sufficient to cause distress.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And indeed this will happen to us ourselves intellectually. For those who happen to slip from their native land, as it were, of their accustomed and most beloved good order and virtue, and come to worse things, and come under diabolical scepters, everywhere and in every way the wicked and opposing powers attack and plot terribly; and if they see someone among those under them having an understanding not uncomely, they strive to acquire him for their own leader, and bring him under his sowings, so that he may no longer bear fruit for God, but rather for Satan.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"For his food is choice," according to what is written;<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup> and bewitching, as it were, the mind that has slipped and slid, so that it may not look much to freedom, they cause it to depart from their service. They sometimes procure the pleasures on earthly things, and as it were enrich with delights leading to nothing, just as indeed the rulers of the Egyptians, about to destroy the wife of blessed Abraham, as it were, flattering with honors and offerings, wished to take away his great grief. For it is written: "And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels."<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup> For Satan, depriving us of the most critical things, and as it were of free offspring and fruitfulness, and subjecting the noble mind to his own insults and licentiousness out of greed, binds it with the pleasure of earthly things. And he once advanced to such madness as to bring the temptation even to Christ Himself. "For taking him up," it says, "he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, and the devil said to him, 'To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.'"<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It holds rightly. But tell me as I ask: What could be the deliverance or rather the aid for those who have suffered?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> God, O noble one, and the grace from Him, not allowing the weakened mind to be under diabolical feet forever, but protecting and delivering the one unable to help himself. And you would see this happened also with the patriarch Abraham. For when the righteous man was at a loss and able to do nothing at all, God intervened and freed the woman from the Egyptian licentiousness. "For the Lord afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife."<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup> And thus he released her, free from insult, though with difficulty. God, therefore, alone would deliver the mind that has slipped from the hand of the devil, and turn it back to the good order of the beginning.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Pressed by lack, then, of the heavenly goods, we sometimes go down to shameful and abominable things.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> So I say.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But is it not surely fitting for the God who loves the good, not to allow us to fall into any such things?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> This is most fitting for God, and desired, O friend; for He would be not at all good, and not very virtuous, if He did not have this aim towards us. But we ourselves are responsible for our suffering, provoking the Master of all to anger; for He is thus angry towards a weak and unmanly mind. Do you not hear Him crying out through one of the holy prophets: "Behold, I will send upon this people weakness, and they shall be weak in it, fathers and sons together; neighbor and friend shall perish."<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup> And the most wise Paul writes concerning some: "And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done."<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup> And the divine Isaiah makes this clearer, saying, as from the person of the sons of Israel, that is, those who have slipped into sins: "Behold, you were angry, and we sinned."<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Tell me then: if we are neglectful of what is fitting and caught by sins, shall we throw the blame on God, and accuse Him of anger, as having sinned because of this?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> We will not accuse, for that is madness; but saying, "You were angry, and we sinned," we understand something of this sort: that if we do not have Your favor, O Master, nothing hinders us from being tyrannized by sin, because of the weakness of our nature, and henceforth to be held by every evil.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I understand what you say.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Being deprived, then, of care and also of the sparing from above, and of extreme forbearance, and paying the penalty for unbridled impulses towards evil, we are shown weak and easily captured, and indeed sick with all such things. And you may clearly see this, coming upon the words of Jeremiah. For the savage multitude of the Jews, though living very richly and luxuriously in the honors from God, and having overcome all their enemies henceforth, and having reached, perhaps, the very height of human glory, practiced a hard and unbreakable disobedience. And almost saying that they were strong in the commandments through Moses, and holding the decrees in very little account, they were carried with unimpeded force to destruction and ruin. For under every green tree and under every leafy oak, according to the prophet's voice,<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> they built altars, and in the most wooded groves, setting up precincts for the demons, they thought fit to honor them as gods and saviors with animal sacrifices and incense, and all the rest, not blushing to say such things, the things crafted by themselves. And they reached such folly at one point as to make the impious slaughter of children a matter of boasting, thinking thus to offer the most splendid sacrifice to them. And the deeds of impiety were not carried out by those from Israel only up to this point. Always adding, as it were, some increase to their daring, the unbridled departure to every extreme, they provoked Him to anger not a little against themselves, though the Lawgiver is kind. And since they boldly shook off servitude to Him, He henceforth let them be tyrannized also by enemies, and to be brought into necessary servitude, I mean under the Chaldeans and Babylonians. For they came, leaving their homes, having enslaved them, and burning the holy and renowned city. And the prophet Jeremiah was asked with difficulty by those being fought, where their evil would end. "And Jeremiah said," it says, "Thus you shall say to Zedekiah: 'Thus says the Lord: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands and with which you are fighting against the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the walls, and I will bring them into the midst of this city. And I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and strong arm, in anger and in great wrath. And I will strike all the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast, with a great pestilence, and they shall die.'"<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup> Then after other things: "And to this people you shall say: 'Thus says the Lord: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, but he who goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall live and shall have his life as a prize of war. For I have set my face against this city for evil and not for good, declares the Lord. It shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.'"<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup> You understand, then, that abandoning God for temporal honors, we wretches will be unable to resist the strength of the enemies, and with divine anger pressing upon us and, as it were, leaping upon us, we shall be slaves instead of free, and live a life inglorious and pitiable.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak well.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For the law of God leads the tender and gentle to a blameless polity, and becomes like a lamp for each, for the demonstration of the useful and necessary; and being overcome by reverence towards it, one would live, I think, not unadmirably, and dwell as in a holy city, the mind established in virtue and standing in piety. But if one chooses to enter readily, as into a fertile and well-wooded thicket, into worldly pleasures, and to linger in the delights of life, and to admit into mind and heart, as it were, a swarm of idols—the manifold pleasure—and to burn for the demons the fruits of his zeal; then indeed, and very reasonably, he would slip away from the sparing from above,</p>
        <p class="paragraph">and a hunt most ready will lie in wait for those wishing to capture him. And being thrust out from the holy city, as it were, of the original good order, he will dwell henceforth as by a necessary yoke, according to the will of the rulers, and will be far from God, in manner of disposition, undergoing a deportation to Babylon, that is, beyond the borders of the holy land, where God is known and his name is great. Therefore, those enduring such a harsh pain, having fallen into the hands of enemies, and not bearing the dwelling with them as slavish and servile, cry out: "By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion."<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup> For the human mind suffers, I think, something of this sort.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What do you mean?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For it is always somewhat sluggish and prone to desire the good things at hand, and it does not greatly desire what it has the power to possess. But if there is a calling to the other side, and it is conquered by the splendor of what it might have, then only with difficulty does it perceive the passions, which it ought to repel with all strength, and not to come to experience if it cuts off the approach beforehand.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> True.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is necessary, then, and wise, and most advantageous, to cut off well the evil things beforehand, and the approach of involuntary servitude, and to strive to turn away quickly from things which, if one were to come to experience them, we would lie in every evil.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is so.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And if the yoke of necessary slavery is brought upon us by divine anger, and indeed the need to come to a debased mind, to resist is not easy. But I would say it is useful, even if only to remember from what things we have turned to what, and to lament bitterly the negligence, and the scarcity of help from above; "For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret."<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup> But if divine anger is not upon us, but it is in our power to choose and do what seems good, and the inclination to both—I mean to evil and to good—is still somehow left and not wholly forced, we must manfully reject the softness, as it were, in depravity, and I think we must beware of shaking off the pleasures on enemies, and of doing what is subject to the hand of enemies, who are said to rule this age.<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup> And if some prosperity should approach, not devoid of worldly honor—for I mean prosperity honored in the world—it turns to a shameful and ugly end altogether.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How did you say?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do you wish us to speak, taking examples from ancient times?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very much.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> When a famine was consuming throughout almost all the land, those from Jacob thought to go to the Egyptians; they were young men, about ten in number, and the purpose of the journey was to buy food, and there was no other. But when they came to this and were then recognized as brothers, Joseph then being the distributor and ruler of the Egyptians, to whom Pharaoh had entrusted what was done, "Pharaoh said to Joseph, 'Say to your brothers, "Do this: load your beasts and go to the land of Canaan, and take your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat of the land." You shall command them also, "Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. Have no concern for your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours."'"<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup> The ruler of the Egyptians, then, promised them rest and to fatten them well with luxury, and indeed gave wagons, making the descent easy, I suppose, for those hesitant. And they, with all their household, went down immediately, having somehow preferred the temporary enjoyment of food over the land and country given by God; for it was by far better and finer to dwell in that land, even if the matter succeeded with a little labor. But when they came to Egypt, they thought perhaps also to escape</p>
        <p class="paragraph">henceforth the toils at home, for which the sensation of present delights was somehow sweet to them. But as time passed, the inglorious yoke of slavery runs under the noble and free multitude from above and from their fathers. Therefore, if along with worldly prosperity comes the falling into baser things, we must reject it, O friend, if the free is in our power, for the slavish thing and mindset is abominable and hateful.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You have spoken excellently.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And what? Do we not say that also that other thing brings no small benefit, as it seems to me, to what we have just said?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What thing do you say?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Rabshakeh the Babylonian, the general of the Assyrians, once led a multitude of bodyguards greater than number, and came to besiege, or rather, thinking to take the entire holy city from its foundations very easily and without toil. Then he brandished the not unpracticed weapon of his tongue, very much accustomed to ranting against God. And saying countless reproaches, he finally addressed those dwelling in the holy city: "Thus says the king of Assyria: If you wish to be blessed, come out to me, and each of you eat from his own vine and his own fig tree, and drink water from his own cistern, until I come and take you to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards."<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup> Consider then that he too promises the luxury and delight of vine and fig tree; and he added, "And drink water from your own cistern."</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But what would these things mean, if led to spiritual contemplation?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> I think the power of depravity in us is accomplished in a twofold manner. For either persuaded by pleasures from without, or by those innate and in us, both from ourselves and from others, to revel, having slipped, they would be caught—those easily led to sin. And the Savior's disciple would show us that this is true, saying thus: "For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life."<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup> For the desire of the flesh is innate and rooted and remaining in us ourselves, and the divine Paul named it the law of sin dwelling in our members.<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup> And delights and pleasures from without and introduced, are those through the eyes. For the things from wealth are admired through the eyes, and fine clothing, and things to which some are devoted as having the sweetest enjoyment, giving them a not ignoble vote. Therefore, the vine and fig tree would be as a type of the delight and luxury from without and introduced, together showing gracefully the temporary and fading nature of worldly affairs, and with this, the sweetness that is accustomed to be with darkness. For all worldly luxury has a sweet immediate participation, but it darkens and terribly intoxicates the one who has received it. And the cistern is an image of the innate and inborn motions in us. For these are not introduced like those, but spring up as from within us, bubbling from the flesh itself. The wicked powers say, then, that participation in all these, both natural and acquired, will be free and very broad enjoyment for us, if, leaving behind the holy and unshaken city—self-control—we go over to the king of Babylon, who was in the type of Satan. But Rabshakeh promised to grant and give the immediate pleasure to those who had gone over to the Babylonians. But they, thinking rightly, were not persuaded; for to those wishing to choose worldly things, the necessity to fall into involuntary slavery and to be in the rank of captives will certainly follow.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> The account is accurate. What then could be the deliverance from these things? Tell me most pleasantly as I ask.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> What other than that which is opposite to the first and original? For inclining by our own wills to wish to live shamefully, and thrusting away the excellence of the blameless polity, we have fallen into an ignoble and slavish mind,</p>
        <p class="paragraph">thinking only of things on earth, and wholly devoted to the pleasures of the flesh. In this way, then, God also let us slip, into a debased mind.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is necessary, then, to return to virtue?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Immediately, O friend, no longer desiring the life in the world, according to that saying through Paul's voice rightly spoken: "For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God."<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup> But rather thirsting for the enrollment in heaven, and making the homeland and city above, as it were, and crying out well to God: "Hear my prayer, for I am a sojourner with you, a stranger, as all my fathers were."<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup> For he who walks on the earth and has his citizenship in heaven<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup> is truly a sojourner and stranger, as would reasonably appear from the very facts. And indeed the Savior's disciple commands us to do this, and to have this as a conspicuous and fitting boast for ourselves, saying thus: "Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul."<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Will such a disposition suffice for the accomplishment of virtue, I mean the ceasing from fleshly desires?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> If the other virtue is also wisely added, clearly the spiritual one. For it is written: "Your commandment is exceedingly broad."<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup> Is not the defilement in us twofold, of soul and body? I would think it necessary, and very reasonable, that the things accustomed to cleanse be equal and of equal power to those accustomed to defile.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You have spoken rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> As, then, the dirt is twofold—spiritual and bodily—so also the cleansing would reasonably be spiritual and bodily. Except that to consider it a sojourn, to love the life in the world, is not unprofitable to see without toil for those thus disposed, if one chooses to make Abraham an image of the matter, to whom it was said by God: "Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you, and I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup> You understand how he commanded him to depart not only from country and house, but also from kindred, and indeed from his father's house, and to come to a land which He Himself would show who called?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But what is this?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Is it not then clear, that when God calls to follow—clearly the spiritual following—and wills to lead out from the life in the world, I mean again the life in pleasures and love of flesh, those whom He chooses to honor, it is utterly senseless to think anything better than such a calling? Let him reckon as nothing country and family, and father's house, and the possession of earthly things. Therefore the Savior Himself called us to the same manliness, saying: "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me."<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup> He added: "And everyone who has left brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands or houses, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life."<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup> For do you not say that the work of the extreme strength understood in Christ is such exceedingly splendid and conspicuous manliness, which counts these things as nothing? And it considers it of great importance to follow Christ.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Certainly, since indeed those called to the marriage feast but refusing to come have slipped away from the best hope and the delight in Christ. One said: "I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come."<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup> Another, saying he bought a field, preferred the temporary things to the calling.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Well done, O Palladius; for you gladden us by saying the fitting things, and leaping well from great quickness of understanding to grasp eagerly the end of the discourse. Consider then that for those wholly and</p>
        <p class="paragraph">completely following God, and making the things of the flesh secondary to hope in Him, and worldly love of pleasure, there will certainly follow the abundant sharing of blessing from above. For what does He say to Abraham? "And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you," and the things connected to these.<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup> Do you see how great a multitude of spiritual goods He heaped upon him? And in what manner he departs from his native land—is it not worthy to see? "For he took," it says, "Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of Moreh."<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup> For he went out from Haran, leaving no remnant of himself in it, and with all his family, as it were, he most eagerly moved to the land of Canaan, which God showed. Then he passes through the land to its length, and comes to the high land. For he who has decided to follow well the divine decrees, and to deem the heavenly calling worthy of the best care, let him go out entirely and completely from the life in worldly pleasures, and as it were with all his family, leaving no remnant of his own mind in what he once was. For thus he departs rightly, and will pass through the land—for he is called by God—so that as the blessed Paul writes, he may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth of the mystery of Christ.<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup> For then he will arrive well at the high land, that is, to the condition exalted in virtues, and having no longer anywhere the inclination to love of flesh. And having already arrived at this, what again will be the good things, we shall learn from the holy Scriptures themselves. "For the Lord appeared to Abram and said, 'To your offspring I will give this land.' And Abram built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him."<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup> For while dwelling in his native land, and having thus moved to the holy land, he is given only the oracle that he must move to another, having been indifferent to his native land. But when he came to the land of Canaan with all his household and all his goods, and leaped up to the holy land, the grace of the vision of God is given, and the certainty of hope in the assurance of freedom, and the permission henceforth to raise an altar. So also for us, according to the same form of the argument, while remaining in the world and its most abominable pleasures, there will be no grace from God; but to those called and obedient to the divine laws, leaping as to a high land the desire and zeal for every good, God implants the knowledge of His own glory, and promises the establishment of hope; and thus He strengthens the mind in us, so that it is already somehow able to offer spiritual sacrifices and to be a pleasing aroma of Christ to God and the Father,<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup> according to what is written; and to present our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is our spiritual worship.<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup> For He gladly receives the modes of worship in spirit, and considers the matter a spiritual sacrifice.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is fitting, then, to move to better things, departing from the baser; and to receive most gladly the heavenly calling, and to cling most of all to love for the things honored by the law, and having obtained the best vote from God. For to seek to go backwards and to look back at any of the things accustomed to do wrong, we will not escape blame.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Indeed so, O friend. For it is most difficult to choose again to be sick with the things from which one has departed; but for those once led out by the power of God from worldly polity, it is very dangerous even to look back at it only, and to go, as it were, to remembrance of transgressions, going with the mind into love for them. And indeed the divine Psalmist begged, saying: "Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things."<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup> For worthlessness is truly the distraction of this life, and the empty delight of temporary things, from which it is fitting</p>
        <p class="paragraph">to stand apart and depart, and to reject even the mere contemplation with pleasure in thoughts for him who has truly chosen to walk uprightly, one may learn easily from there.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> From what, then?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The inhabitants of Sodom, being savagely maddened towards unnatural pleasures, and dishonoring the law of intercourse, which nature ordained for the begetting of children, but touching the seasons of youths, and accomplishing things extremely outrageous, they provoked to anger, and as it were forced justice to come upon them, though the Creator is loving towards mankind. And when the time for suffering was at the door, as it were, the forbearance towards them being exhausted, those who would fulfill this entered Sodom. And it is written thus: "The two angels came to Sodom in the evening. Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth and said, 'My lords, please turn aside to your servant's house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way.' They said, 'No; we will spend the night in the square.' But he pressed them strongly, and they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate."<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup> For Lot, being indeed from the blood of Abraham, and brought up in the laws of righteousness, and having cared not a little for piety towards God, sojourned in Sodom. He was an immigrant and stranger to them both in race and manner. "For what partnership has light with darkness? Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever?"<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup> And detesting the native evils, and treading his accustomed path of life, he held to holy pursuits, and honoring the law of hospitality most of all, sitting by the entrances of the city, he received those entering them kindly, knowing the thing to be God-loving. And when those came who would bring justice upon those who had licentiously run to licentiousness (they were a pair of angels), he meets them quickly, and clearly reveals the indication of the kindness in him by the address. For he bowed with his face to the earth, urges them to go home, and to revel in the laws of love. But they say: "No, we will spend the night in the square"; by this indicating that they were strangers and without a home, and provoking, I suppose, the one who had chosen to show hospitality to more earnest zeal, and almost cleverly hinting that he would not rightly leave them destitute of a hearth and cast out in the very crossroads; which indeed the righteous man understood, and pressed them more strongly, and did not make the invitation as a snatch from a weak and rather feeble mind. Therefore he brings them in, and set before them unleavened bread, and prepared a drink. But these things the righteous man did. The Sodomites, suffering a naked and shameful pleasure, going around the house of the righteous man impiously, and having fallen beyond the extreme shamelessness, demanded that they be allowed to do their customary things, then, when they ought to have chosen hospitality, they wished to harm with unnatural licentiousness. And when Lot tried to turn them away from such savage and most abominable attempts, they wanted to disable him; and he would have perhaps even suffered it, if the saviors had not been present. "For the men reached out their hands," it says, "and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door. And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door."<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup> And his deliverance is not measured only in these things. For it is written again: "When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, 'Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city.' And he lingered, but the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand,"<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup> in the Lord’s sparing them.”<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup> This then is a sign to you, and a very clear one, that we are not to be enticed by words alone, and by exhortations that reach the mind, to depart from sin, but that we must also henceforth come to this mildness of the whole Savior God towards us, so as to make His help effectual, according to that which is written, “You have held my right hand, and in Your counsel You have guided me.”<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup> For since human nature is not very strong, nor indeed sufficiently able to be able to penetrate evil, God somehow contends together with it for this. And He is seen to bestow a double grace: persuading by admonitions and providing help, and making the evil that is at our feet and that tyrannizes over us better. And you might see that this also is true, that very few indeed are the guardians of righteousness, and great in life is the scarcity of good men; for to find a faithful man is a work, according to what is written.<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup> Nevertheless, such a one is chosen, and has been deemed worthy of care from above not incidentally. For even if he is in the world mixed with others, yet he suffers no harm from it, for as a lily is snatched from thorns,<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup> so a righteous man would not perish together with the ungodly, according to the voices of the saints.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is clear, then, that by the forbearance from God, and the assistance of holy angels, we shall wash away the greed that comes from depravity, and we shall unquestionably find that we are in no way at all to be caught in the punishments of the wicked, believing clearly in God who has cried out through one of the prophets, “I am the Lord your God, who holds your right hand, who says to you, Do not fear, Jacob, you small number of Israel, I have helped you, says the Lord, who redeems you, Israel.”<sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For would not the fact that Lot was held by the hand of the angels show that the all-powerful God is a helper to the saints? For they would be a type of God. Three at first coming to Abraham in the oak of Mamre, and two visiting Sodom. “For the Father judges no one,” according to the voice of the Savior Himself, “but has given all judgment to the Son,”<sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup> with the Holy Spirit obviously coexisting and inhereing in Him naturally.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You understand very well. But let us gather what follows, if it seems good.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Very intricate indeed, and I will speak. “And it came to pass,” it says, “when they had brought him outside, they said, ‘Save your own soul; do not look back, nor stop anywhere in the surrounding region; flee to the mountain, lest you be swept away.’”<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup> Now in the words, “Save your own soul,” I say it is clearly meant, “Keep yourself pure; and do not share in another’s sin.”<sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup> And be better than the hindrances in the world; for nothing is equivalent to the soul. “For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul?”<sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup> And the need to say that we must make our departure without turning back, signifies perhaps the thing, not to think again equally with those who have been brought under the punishment of fire because of intemperance (“For no one,” He says, “who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of heaven”<sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup>), but we must hold to the way of salvation, not being distracted here and there, and a mind that is light and easily swayed by the attractive images of worldly desires, but a mind that is perfect and sleepless, and always practiced in looking straight ahead, keeping within ourselves. And I will say something even greater: for the angel says not only that he must now make his departure without turning back; he added usefully, “Do not stop anywhere in the surrounding region. Flee to the mountain, lest you be swept away.”</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And what would “Do not stop anywhere in the surrounding region” mean?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Sluggishness and inertia in the need to flee from evil, I think, is dangerous and harmful.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Explain how.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> A prophetic word says, “Woe to those who do the work of the Lord carelessly.”<sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup> And “Run that you may obtain,”<sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup> the divine Paul himself says somewhere. For indeed, the unwillingness to act most vigorously and with zeal to flee from baser things, when the mind clings tenaciously to its old ways and withdraws gloomily from each evil thing, and changes over to what is naturally beneficial with great reluctance, would be nothing else than to stop henceforth in the region of wickedness, though one ought to flee swiftly. For the possibility of those who are always hesitating and shrinking back, before getting outside the bounds of evil, being overtaken by punishment, before cleansing the stain, before washing away the defilement that has sunk into the soul from former carelessness, before unloading the accusations, and running under the saving yoke, to find rest through Christ. Therefore, the best of exhortations is, “Do not stop anywhere in the surrounding region,” that is, In no way delay and be caught in depravity, but rather go, as to a mountain, to a certain select and conspicuous life, having nothing lowly, but shining in high and exalted virtue, and freed from the most abject mindset, that is, the earthly and fleshly. For it is written, “The mighty ones of the earth are greatly exalted by God.”<sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup> For holy-mindedness is far above earthly things. “And the young eagles fly aloft,”<sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup> according to what is written, if indeed they have, as it were, their citizenship in heaven as in a mountain,<sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup> and they claim a homeland above. And Paul writes somewhere, “Seek the things that are above, not the things that are on earth.”<sup><a href="#fn92" id="ref92">92</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> The mountain, then, is the intelligible life in holiness, and the transcendent excellence of the select way of life, while that in impurity and love of sin, and attached to earthly things, is understood as below.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Well said; for this our argument makes very clear, and you might wonder at this also.</p>

        <p class="question">Palladius:</span> What is that?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For the blessed angel said that the divine Lot must run without delay and without turning back, and that he must leap to the mountain. But he entreated, saying, “I beg you, Lord, since your servant has found mercy before you, and you have magnified your righteousness, which you do to save my life; but I shall not be able to escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me and I die. Behold, this city is near for me to flee there, and it is small; there I shall be saved. Is it not small, and will my soul live?” And having said this to him, it says, “Behold, I have granted your request also in this matter, not to overthrow the city of which you have spoken. Hasten, therefore, to be saved there, for I cannot do anything until you enter there.” Therefore he called the name of that city Zoar. The sun had risen upon the earth, and Lot entered Zoar.<sup><a href="#fn93" id="ref93">93</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And what benefit might come to us through these things, I would very much like to learn, as you well know.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do you not understand, though leaning much toward what is very easy to understand, that for those who have just fled from depravity, and think they must hasten to the path of salvation, virtue is not immediately, nor indeed from first attempts, easily captured and the seeming path passable? But neither would one easily return to a select way of life, nor would he become far from the passions that have somehow been nurtured with him, but he will be outside such things gently, at least as far as eagerness for better things, and beginnings of attempts; but not very high, nor far; and he will almost migrate to a land as if to another, to a life indeed praiseworthy, but not yet having obtained high and conspicuous glory, such as was the pedagogy according to the law, referring to the beginnings of the best and good life. For it is written, “The beginning of a good way is to do just things.”<sup><a href="#fn94" id="ref94">94</a></sup> For just as for those devoted to knowledge, and desirous of the contemplation of the mystery, the word of catechesis would be suitable in the beginnings and most fitting; but they press on to the perfect man already, and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,<sup><a href="#fn95" id="ref95">95</a></sup> the more solid food would already somehow fit, that is, the discourse concerning the highest things, and every path henceforth of dogmatic inquiry; so also here I say, that is, in the corrections of character and habits, it would not be possible immediately to leap up</p>

        <p class="paragraph">to the blameless, or rather to a certain splendid and transcendent way of life. It would be fitting, I think, to proceed little by little toward the existing condition, beginning from small and moderate things, and almost running ahead as to a small city, neighboring a high mountain, the way of life that is subordinate and in the middle of the select and separated life. For indeed the righteous Lot would be a type of those disposed thus, not immediately to the mountain, but desiring to lodge in the small city Zoar. For is it not also in the evangelical preaching that we often find such dispensations occurring among the believers? And indeed the blessed Paul writes, saying, “It is good for a man not to touch a woman; but because of immoralities, let each have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. This I say by way of concession, not of command. For I wish that all men were even as I myself. But each has his own gift from God, one in this manner, and another in that.”<sup><a href="#fn96" id="ref96">96</a></sup> Do you see how he showed us the exceeding excellence of self-control as a mountain, saying, “It is good for a man not to touch a woman”; but he allowed us to lodge in Zoar, that is, in the way of life still subordinate to the perfect state, I mean the permission to be united only with one’s own wife? And the best land, the Savior said, would yield fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.<sup><a href="#fn97" id="ref97">97</a></sup> And He distributed the talent, not in equal measure, but to one five, to another two, to another one,<sup><a href="#fn98" id="ref98">98</a></sup> showing through these, I think, the inequality of capacities, and distributing to each according as he has aptitude and disposition. For as we said just now, “Each has his own gift from God, one in this manner, and another in that.”</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak well.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The blessed angel allowed him to lodge in Zoar. “For behold,” he says, “I have granted your request also in this matter, not to overthrow the city of which you have spoken. Hasten, therefore, to be saved there.” Then it says, “The sun had risen upon the earth, and Lot entered Zoar.”<sup><a href="#fn99" id="ref99">99</a></sup> You might wonder, O friend, what the meaning of these things might also be, “For I have granted,” he says, “your request, not to overthrow the city of which you have spoken.” For truly, the way of life that is not perfect in virtue, and that is in some way still subject to passions, is unacceptable to God, and worthy of rejection and not far from condemnation. Nevertheless, out of loving-kindness, and having measured what is attainable in the beginning according to nature, He commands to be saved, and while still practicing the good, thus to advance in the responsible way of life. But also for those who have come to this measure, and who enter into this condition, the entry would not be without divine light and illumination from above. “For the sun had risen,” it says, “and Lot entered Zoar.”</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You have spoken most reasonably!</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> So the divine Lot rushed into the still small city, God permitting him; but the woman who followed him and ran out with him was shown weak even for this. “For she looked back,” it says, “and became a pillar of salt.”<sup><a href="#fn100" id="ref100">100</a></sup> And see that the courageous mind and the youthful resolve, even if it does not arrive perfectly at what is pleasing to God, having begun to achieve virtue, nevertheless makes progress little by little toward the better. But the weak and unmanly one, of whom the woman is a sign, becomes utterly useless through turning back to depravity. For this, I think, signifies becoming a pillar of salt: which would be a symbol of a mind grown dull, and a mind set to change over to folly, and having already arrived at a kind of extreme insensibility. And salt that has lost its strength will be good for nothing, as the Savior Himself said;<sup><a href="#fn101" id="ref101">101</a></sup> and it will be utterly useless, cast out and trampled underfoot by men. So the woman was turned to stone, and Lot not long after added what was lacking. For it is written, “Lot went up from Zoar and sat in the mountain, he and his two daughters with him. For he feared to dwell in Zoar, and he lived in the cave, he and his two daughters with him.”<sup><a href="#fn102" id="ref102">102</a></sup> For the mind advances as if by steps to what it now has, and leaps up little by little to what it was in the beginning, not being suitably nor very adequately disposed. And it advances and returns to the better, being accompanied by spiritual prudence and courage as by its own daughters, and leaving below the pleasure-loving and unmanly, of which the woman is a type. And henceforth he dwells as in a mountain and in a cave: the mountain indicating to us the high and exalted condition of spiritual well-being, and the cave, the fixed and steadfast permanence in virtue, making it very clear. For it is written thus concerning good men: “He who walks in righteousness, speaks a straight way, hates lawlessness and injustice, and shakes his hands free from bribes, stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed, shuts his eyes from seeing evil, he will dwell in a high cave of a strong rock.”<sup><a href="#fn103" id="ref103">103</a></sup> And there would be another interpretation not implausible to us on this point. For Christ is the rock,<sup><a href="#fn104" id="ref104">104</a></sup> because of the strength and invulnerability of the highest essence of all. And the cave would be understood as the Church in Christ, the dwelling of the saints, the shelter of the godly, in which the righteous dwell, and indeed as many as refuse the judgment by fire.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How excellently our discourse holds, O friend! And I would wish to proceed with as many other demonstrations as possible for our exercise. For to love to know richly what leads to benefit, I would consider worthy of everything.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And indeed, O Palladius, you speak reasonably. For the fruit of a mind most eager to learn would be wealth for us, and the discourse from us will be better than that of the hesitant, not seeming to me to impose untimely silence on such brilliant and lovely narratives. Therefore, that we must entirely and wholly disentangle ourselves from disposition toward and association with base things, as far as possible; and moreover, that the ability to leap up to virtue would come in no other way than through this same manner, we shall see without toil, applying the eye of the mind well, and looking well at the things concerning the divine Abraham, and at the things accomplished beyond reason concerning the exodus of those from Israel, which they made at the time of the Egyptian oppression, having broken the bonds.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Speak then in order. For you know well that you will greatly delight us if you choose to do this.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> We were saying, then, that the divine Abraham, compelled by a terrible famine once, and by lack of necessities, made the descent into Egypt not willingly, and yielded to necessity. And being a stranger and sojourner, Pharaoh afflicted him with grief and greed. For he wanted to take away the wife who lived with him, being inflamed with uncontrolled lusts, toward shameful deeds. But God did not allow him to accomplish this. “For He plagued Pharaoh,” it says, “with great plagues because of Sarah, the wife of Abraham.”<sup><a href="#fn105" id="ref105">105</a></sup> And Pharaoh is an image and type of diabolical intemperance. For his aim and his most earnest endeavor is to implant the seeds of the impurity within him into the understandings of the saints, so that they may bear fruit that is pleasing and agreeable to him. And these, I think, would be the accusations leading to manifold sin. And everyone would be caught, and unwillingly subjected to his greed. For nature is sick with weakness, but God does not permit it, somehow checking the attempts against the saints, and the plots of the evil one. And it happened that the divine Abraham escaped the harms in no other way than by leaving the Egyptians and returning to the place given by God at the beginning, to which having come he was a diligent cultivator of good pursuits. And it is written thus: “Abraham went up from Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the wilderness. Now Abraham was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold. And he went wherever he had gone out into the wilderness, as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, to the place of the altar which he had made there at first. And there Abraham called on the name of the Lord.”<sup><a href="#fn106" id="ref106">106</a></sup> Do you understand, then, that it is necessary for those who flee from worldly intemperance to another holy life to bring with them all their belongings, as it were? For with all his household and family, I might add also with all his equipment, the patriarch Abraham fled from the land of the Egyptians. For one must depart wholly and with all one’s household, as it were, migrate to the wilderness, that is, to an undisturbed and pure condition of the mind, from which human nature also departed at the beginning, having turned toward worse things because of lack of the goods from above. For this is what the descent into foreigners mystically signifies, from a land and tent as it were that was at the beginning and most beloved, in which also was an altar. For returning thus, until we come to the place and region of the altar that was at the beginning, that is, of the sanctification that was of old, we also call upon the God of all, saying that prophetic address, “Lord, apart from You we know no other. We name Your name.”<sup><a href="#fn107" id="ref107">107</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You have spoken most elegantly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And we would have the matter not otherwise, also considering well the things that happened to the sons of Israel in due time; whom, after the Egyptians had taken them, a famine having driven them down at first, and yoking those who were from above and from a holy root, and free, to an unexpected and unaccustomed servitude to them, they oppressed savagely, having formed such a pretext for their cruelty. “For a new king arose over Egypt,” it says, “who did not know Joseph. And he said to his people, ‘Behold, the race of the sons of Israel is a great multitude, and they are stronger than we; come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and when war happens, they also join our enemies, and fight against us and go out of the land.’”<sup><a href="#fn108" id="ref108">108</a></sup> For it grieved, I think, the ruler of the land of the Egyptians, that those who were yoked by necessary bondage, not by choice, might at some time choose to see freedom. “And he set over them,” it says, “taskmasters over the works, to afflict them with the works, and they built fortified cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Rameses, and On, which is Heliopolis.”<sup><a href="#fn109" id="ref109">109</a></sup> For the fruits of unbearable greed were the continual sufferings in clay and brickmaking, and cities fortified with walls, and raising of mounds in the fields, and these things were accomplished for the laborers without pay and with much sweat. For the rulers of this age,<sup><a href="#fn110" id="ref110">110</a></sup> taking the wretched souls of men under their hand, entangle them in clay and brickmaking and in deeds done on and concerning the earth, and binding them with an evil and unprofitable trial (for such appear the works of the flesh and those concerning it), they compel them to lead a life bitter and utterly wretched, which in no way will bring benefit to those compelled to practice it. For what would the works and passions of the flesh profit our wretched soul? But gain will be stored up for the devil and demons from us, and the wealth and boast of the kingdom of the adversaries, just as indeed for Pharaoh he thought it no small glory to have cities built for him by those from Israel, who were compelled to come to this without pay and unwillingly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is so. For indeed the argument is very clear.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Well then, the toil of the Israelites describes a representation and as it were a clear image of our vain and unholy endeavors on earth, with Satan himself and the wicked powers with him pressing upon and leaping upon them, whom the divine Scripture indicates by the names of the taskmasters; and I would say that this wicked distraction, full of sweat and toil, filled as it were with clay and impurity, and muddy pleasure. But God pitied even then those who were most impiously and savagely oppressed by the Egyptians,</p>

        <p class="paragraph">and sent them a deliverer in due time, Moses. “For He saw,” it says, “their affliction, and heard their cry, and knew them.”<sup><a href="#fn111" id="ref111">111</a></sup> And He says to Moses, “I have surely seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows. And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey.”<sup><a href="#fn112" id="ref112">112</a></sup> And He adds, “And now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.”<sup><a href="#fn113" id="ref113">113</a></sup> Do you see how God, seeing the oppression of those who are under the devil, and knowing their grief, promises them deliverance from the evils, and leads them to a good and broad land, that is, to the free and untrammeled life in Christ, flowing with the milk and honey of spiritual goods?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I understand.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do you wish us to examine the story accurately, as we have said?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very much.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is written, “After these things, Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh and said to him, ‘Thus says the Lord God of Israel: “Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.”’ And Pharaoh said, ‘Who is the Lord, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know the Lord, and I will not let Israel go.’”<sup><a href="#fn114" id="ref114">114</a></sup> So Moses and Aaron, being sent by God, demanded of the Egyptians to release Israel, that they might serve God. But Pharaoh, being hard-hearted, said, “I do not know the Lord,” and refused to let them go. And they, being oppressed more severely, were in evil condition, as the Scripture says: “And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying, ‘You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks as before; let them go and gather straw for themselves. And the quota of bricks which they made before you shall lay on them; you shall not reduce it, for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, “Let us go and sacrifice to our God.” Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor in it and not pay attention to deceptive words.’”<sup><a href="#fn115" id="ref115">115</a></sup> So the officers of the sons of Israel, being in evil plight, said to Moses and Aaron, “The Lord look upon you and judge, because you have made us odious in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us.”<sup><a href="#fn116" id="ref116">116</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And what is this? For I do not clearly understand the meaning of the things said.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The Egyptians had a custom, established by law, that those who sacrificed to the gods should do so in temples and precincts, with closed doors, so that the uninitiated might not see the rites. But the Hebrews, being compelled to sacrifice in the open, in crossroads and in fields, were defiled by the sight of the dead. For the thing that prevented by boundaries was nothing at all. And the historical account might have for us the plausibility in the customs of the Egyptians, but it would be correctly said by the all-wise Moses, even if understood spiritually. For we must sacrifice as in a wilderness, and keep a holy feast to God, departing from the Egyptians, and refuse the sight of death. For with a mind at leisure and standing far from being darkened in a worldly way, and turning away the eye from things that bring to deadness and corruption, we shall sacrifice purely to the God who rules all. And dead works would be those of the flesh. And worldly darkness is the defilement from evil and vain distractions, polluting the pure and bright ether of the mind. That we ought to be separated from these, if we wish to serve sincerely, the historical account persuades us.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And indeed this is not unclear; but then, proceed for me with what follows.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Well then, a bitter and sharp longing for their ancient freedom, I think, entered those from Israel; and having already inclined to this, they terribly provoked to anger him who bound them with the yokes of servitude. And saying that it was a work of leisure to have such desires, he commands them to stretch themselves out in the sweat of the works, the accustomed quota being demanded without delay, but the distribution of straw being cut off unusually for them; for he said, “You are idle, you are idle; therefore you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord our God.’ Now therefore go and work; for straw shall not be given you, and you shall deliver the quota of bricks.”<sup><a href="#fn117" id="ref117">117</a></sup> So the officers of the sons of Israel saw themselves in evil plight, saying, “You shall not diminish anything from your bricks, your daily task.” And they met Moses and Aaron as they came out from Pharaoh, and said to them, “The Lord look upon you and judge, because you have made us odious in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us.”<sup><a href="#fn118" id="ref118">118</a></sup> For, O friend, do you not say that it is accurate, that whenever someone chooses to be released from the yoke of the devil’s greed, and to take up the bright and free boast of service to God, and to be at leisure and to know the true Master, according to that sung in the Psalms, “Be still, and know that I am God,”<sup><a href="#fn119" id="ref119">119</a></sup> the enemy will accuse us as something impious, this leisure and desire, and the adversary rises up together with the other wicked and unclean spirits, compelling savagely to cling incessantly to fleshly and earthly impurity and to the things in the world, according to each one’s habit, and not at all allowing to abstain from accustomed depravity, and making this also hard to obtain, so that the evil might not be easily escaped and come to an end? For these things, I think, indicate the demanding strenuously the quota of brickmaking, but depriving them of the means by which it might be done easily, that is, the straw. For we are somehow accustomed then especially to seek most eagerly and vigorously the accustomed things, and to be inflamed with hotter desires for them, when something appears in between that necessarily leads to not being able to obtain them. And when the divine law re-educates the human mind away from baser things, then especially a great longing enters, calling to the same things, and almost persuading to cry out against the lawgiver; and of this again the officers of the sons of Israel are a demonstration in shadows, being accustomed to the works, and not seeing the easy way to them; for they were in want of straw, and they blamed Moses and Aaron greatly for the charge brought upon them, saying that they had become a cause, and that they had to endure a more grievous onset of oppression,</p>

        <p class="paragraph">for no other reason than that a longing for freedom had entered them, persuaded by their words.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> For do you not think he speaks reasonable and true things?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Absolutely, O Palladius; for at the same time a good desire and a good reasoning perhaps stirred us to choose what seems good to God, and we remembered the law for piety; but the adversary, who is by nature prone to harm, especially presses grievously, but God hides and saves. And indeed He said to Moses, “Go, speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments; and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be your God, and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who brings you out from the land of Egypt, from under the burdens of the Egyptians.’”<sup><a href="#fn120" id="ref120">120</a></sup> For when Satan turns us away, and raises up every good desire, and pushes away by whatever means he can the inclinations to this, the law of God urges to good will, showing the helper unbroken, and sharpening to boldness with most confident hope, and strengthening with faith, and ascribing to God as truly Savior and Redeemer.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How altogether excellent and saving a thing is faith, and the need to follow the thirst for God!</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Rightly said. And that faith brings the good to an end, you will know well, as our argument reaches its proper goal. For when Moses and those with him came to speak to Pharaoh again, and to persuade him to release and free Israel from the ancient bonds of the Egyptians, they wished to persuade him with signs beyond reason, and they showed the transformation of a rod into a serpent, and moreover that they could accomplish greater and more excellent things most readily, clearly promising through God. But he commanded his own magicians to do likewise, almost crying out through this: We are not ignorant of such works. Very many are such among the Egyptians or among you; and to work wonders is the practice of the magicians, to whom you also belong. But as he was hardened exceedingly, and would not let Israel go, four terrible plagues, each worse than the other, were brought: for water was changed into blood paradoxically, and frogs and gnats, and finally the dog-fly, already somewhat more gently, as by an unbearable necessity, they made Pharaoh yield. Then calling Moses and those with him, he says, “Go, sacrifice to the Lord your God in the land.” And Moses said, “It is not right to do so; for we shall sacrifice to the Lord our God the abominations of the Egyptians. For if we sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us? We will go a three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the Lord our God, as He commands us.” And Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away.”<sup><a href="#fn121" id="ref121">121</a></sup> For when Satan resists, and has determined to oppose manfully our eagerness for the good, God rises against him, and subdues him when he becomes bold, and tames him with plagues. But then he lets go unwillingly, with difficulty; yet he still tries to persuade us not to make our service to God exact, nor yet to depart entirely from servitude to him. For he commanded the Jews to sacrifice not outside their own land, but in it. But Moses very wisely says, “It is not right to do so.”<sup><a href="#fn122" id="ref122">122</a></sup> For the inventor of sin always becomes the suggester of base things; but the divine law sends them away and forbids doing what seems good to him. Therefore, those who wish to live rightly must attend not to what the Evil One says deceivingly, but to what the divine oracle declares to us. “For Your law,” he says, “is a lamp to my feet and a light to my paths.”<sup><a href="#fn123" id="ref123">123</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> True.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, when the Evil One constrains us, or rather wishes to imprison us and make us subject to himself, we must serve the only God by nature, and going as far as possible from double-mindedness,</p>

        <p class="paragraph">let us say, “It is not right to do so.” – – “For no one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other.”<sup><a href="#fn124" id="ref124">124</a></sup> And it is written, “Woe to cowardly hearts and slack hands, and to the sinner who walks on two paths!”<sup><a href="#fn125" id="ref125">125</a></sup> For I say we must offer pure and blameless service to the God who rules all, having departed entirely from service under him; and thus seek to go to the better manfully; otherwise, “We shall sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians,” he says, “to the Lord our God. For if we sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians before their eyes, will they not stone us?”<sup><a href="#fn126" id="ref126">126</a></sup> And as far as the historical account is concerned, the refusal is well-founded. For abominations here he says are the objects of worship; and calves were the object of worship for the Egyptians. These, he says, if we sacrifice to the God of the Hebrews, we shall provoke the Egyptians to anger in every way and altogether, making the matter bitter. Sometimes the argument is plausible. But as far as it pertains to spiritual contemplation, it has no small benefit. For the multitude of demons honors especially, and considers of great importance, and deems worthy of all account; but we, putting them to death, offer our own service to God.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How did you say?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For are not the passions of the flesh honored among them, and not at all for themselves, but because through them we are destroyed, and we are strangled to servitude under them?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> True.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Putting these to death and as it were slaughtering them, we shall be a sweet-smelling aroma to God. And Paul writes thus: “Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.”<sup><a href="#fn127" id="ref127">127</a></sup> And one would do this correctly by putting to death the members that are on the earth: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness.<sup><a href="#fn128" id="ref128">128</a></sup> Each, therefore, of the passions in us is an abomination of the intelligible Egyptians, that is, most venerable. For that it is customary for the divine Scripture to call an abomination what is in the rank of an idol, and as it were an object of worship, God persuades by saying through the voice of Jeremiah, concerning the Synagogue of the Jews: “What has my beloved done in my house as an abomination?”<sup><a href="#fn129" id="ref129">129</a></sup> And if someone should wish to say that the abomination of the Egyptians is as it were a hated thing and a refusal, he would not miss the fitting meaning; for the things that the unclean spirits are always accustomed to hate and abominate, these will be offered by us as a sweet-smelling aroma to God, and as a spiritual sacrifice: faith, meekness, self-control, sobriety, brotherly love, and the boasts of sincerity toward God.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And who would be those sacrificing in the land of the Evil One? And who would be understood as those outside the land?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Those who have not yet gone out from the Egyptians, and sacrifice to God in it, are very many, and perhaps beyond number; but those outside and in the wilderness, are very few and chosen; “For many are called,” He says, “but few are chosen.”<sup><a href="#fn130" id="ref130">130</a></sup> We are all called to freedom through faith in Christ, and we have been redeemed from the devil’s tyranny, Christ bringing us to this, having prefigured it well of old in Moses and Aaron, so that in this you may understand the Emmanuel as lawgiver and high priest and apostle, in a dispensation. But most of the called still cling to the former evils, and with their mind not yet having gone out wholly from worldly deceit, they serve God as if in naked faith alone. These we say are those sacrificing in Egypt, or having gone out a little. “For you shall not go very far away,”<sup><a href="#fn131" id="ref131">131</a></sup> says the hard-hearted Pharaoh, even if you run out from the land of the Egyptians. But those who wish to be well-pleasing to God with a whole removal to the good, having been freed and entirely from worldly confusion, are carried out of the Egyptians, and escape the hand of the tyrant, and in the wilderness of the leisured and relaxed life, pure, they sacrifice purely to God. And I would say also in another way, that those who run to truth from serving the creature rather than the Creator,<sup><a href="#fn132" id="ref132">132</a></sup> and are called to the knowledge of the true God by nature, must be carried far away from the land of the Egyptians. For they have not yet completely gone out who have not yet wiped away the remnants of the ancient deceit from their own mind. For some observe days and months and seasons and years.<sup><a href="#fn133" id="ref133">133</a></sup> These, called to the free dignity through Christ, dwelling in the Egyptians, still sacrifice to God, preserving a life not unwelcome to Satan. But if someone goes out entirely, having declared that he is strong in the older customs, he sacrifices in the wilderness, and practices a life worthy of all praise.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I agree; for you think correctly. But let the discourse flow again for us.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> So then Pharaoh lies, and denies the promise, but he does not yet let the Israelites go. Then he is afflicted with three other plagues, and reluctantly yields, having said he would let go; and he is caught lying again. “For he is a liar, and the truth is not in him,”<sup><a href="#fn134" id="ref134">134</a></sup> according to the voice of the Savior. And He sends the most violent hail upon the Egyptians, God threatening, and indeed sending, and moreover the locust that destroys the fields, if one must also take a word from the Greeks to say. Then, then at last the formerly terrible and unbreakable bodyguards of Pharaoh’s vileness make a very great outcry against him, saying, “How long shall this be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God. Do you not yet know that Egypt is destroyed?”<sup><a href="#fn135" id="ref135">135</a></sup> And again it occurs to me to think that Satan is perhaps better than the powers under him, in matters where victory is fitting for him. For those, as it seems, are very harsh and utterly unrelenting, and go slowly and with difficulty; but yet they might at least come to a moderate perception of divine wrath; but he is preeminent in cruelty beyond reason, and hardened to the extreme. For it is written, “His heart is hardened like a stone, and he stands like an unyielding anvil.”<sup><a href="#fn136" id="ref136">136</a></sup> Therefore, when there was a very great outcry against him, he said with difficulty to Moses and those with him, “Go and serve the Lord your God. But who are those who are going?” And Moses said, “We will go with our young men and our old men, with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds; for it is a feast of the Lord our God.” And he said to them, “May the Lord be with you, as I let you go, and your little ones also? Look, evil is before you. Not so; let the men go, and serve the Lord, for that is what you desire.”<sup><a href="#fn137" id="ref137">137</a></sup> Understand, then, O friend, that Moses said the departure must be made in the best manner; but he says, Not so; but he would let go in part, and he said that the remainder must be as a kind of hostage for the return of those departing, and their baggage remaining in Egypt. Let all your young men go, he says; and every kind in their prime. But the divine Moses strongly insists that it is fitting to depart, leaving nothing behind; but together with those in youth and in the decline of age, sons and daughters, and herds of cattle, and other livestock. For indeed it is fitting for those striving to claim true freedom to depart from the evils in the world, and to go the path of virtues, leaving no remnant at all of their own soul and mind, through which they might again be brought under the greed of the evil one. And the divine law calls to this young men and virgins, old men with younger, according to the voice of the Psalmist, and every kind of age understood in Christ. To whom also the divine John spoke, saying, “I write to you, children, because you have known the Father; I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning; I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.”<sup><a href="#fn138" id="ref138">138</a></sup> And in another way, young men are a type of courage, old men of prudence, sons and daughters of the infancy understood in Christ; for with courage, and prudence, and simplicity according to God, we depart from sin to sanctification. “Be courageous,” he says, “and let your heart be strengthened.”<sup><a href="#fn139" id="ref139">139</a></sup> And again,</p>

        <p class="paragraph">“Be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.”<sup><a href="#fn140" id="ref140">140</a></sup> And saying that flocks and herds run out together, he indicates, I think, that we must not leave even the bodily and more irrational movements within us to Satan. And indeed the divine Paul writes: “For just as you presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.”<sup><a href="#fn141" id="ref141">141</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Does Pharaoh then let go those in their prime and in vigor, but claims the others?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For who do you say is the one remaining in Egypt?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> There were, I think, certainly women, unripe children, and weak old men, and irrational possessions.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Then, O excellent one, why do you not immediately perceive that?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What do you say?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For those who are vigorous and young, and have a more vigorous disposition to piety, he considers burdensome; for he dismisses them, I think, unwillingly, those who resist, who are able to oppose and defend themselves when wronged, according to that, “Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.”<sup><a href="#fn142" id="ref142">142</a></sup> But he claims very much those not inclined to be manly, and as a weak and unwarlike race, and he loves the feminine and soft mindset sick within himself, and as it were slack and weak, and still childish, and the dense and more irrational, as in the type of cattle and sheep.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Well said.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But again the hard and unbending Pharaoh lies. Then, with the assaults of the locust consuming their whole land, as it were, he sends for Moses, with Aaron running in with him, and says, “Go, serve the Lord your God; but let your flocks and your herds be left behind, and let your baggage go with you.” And Moses said, “But you must also give us sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God; and our livestock also shall go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind; for from them we must take to serve the Lord our God.”<sup><a href="#fn143" id="ref143">143</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And to what should we apply the meaning of the things said by the all-wise Moses? Or how might one take the things from Egypt and Pharaoh, and offer them to God?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And indeed, O friend, the argument is clear. For he who opposes and fights against those wishing to be pious, if it were not possible for some to be entirely under him, desires at least to have this in part; but the law of God teaches to make the departure most decisive, not allowing anything at all to be and remain under him, no part of soul, no part of mind, no occasion of bodily movement. Moreover, it commands to bring to God the finest and choicest things of life in the world. For this, I think, indicates taking from Egypt and sacrificing to God. Would not those who contend against our holy and divine doctrines through worldly wisdom, and seek the brilliance in speech and the sharpness in knowledge, and perform reasonable service to God, be doing this? “For all wisdom is from the Lord,”<sup><a href="#fn144" id="ref144">144</a></sup> according to what is written. But in a worldly spirit, we say that the poets and prose writers among the Greeks attained this brilliance in eloquence. And indeed the divine Paul: “We have received,” he says, “not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things freely given to us by God; which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit.”<sup><a href="#fn145" id="ref145">145</a></sup> That Moses was truly still in shadows, saying that the choicest things of life in the world would not be rejected by the true God by nature, he shows clearly immediately, though as in a type and shadow. For God commanding to spoil the Egyptians, he said they must use vessels of gold and silver, from neighbor and fellow-dweller, which indeed is accomplished through women. For the matter is always somehow whispering and very talkative, and clever for deception. And vessels of gold and silver from the Egyptians would be, I think, as I said just now, the things by which it was likely that some in the world were admired, even if they knew the true God. And it is, I say, something like this again. For the movements of mind and soul are common to all men, and the aptitude for every good and evil thing. But those who have used the advantages of nature well achieve a glorious and excellent life. But those who turn them most foolishly to what is not fitting, somehow indicate that the good things of nature also go the way of the most shameful things. For courage and prudence are good for those who use them best, but harmful for those who do not have them rightly; for it is possible to be courageous and prudent with praise and applause; but it is also possible to possess these with great blame. These things are common and in all, both in those still wandering and in those who know God. When, therefore, the courage that formerly worked depravity, and the sharpness in understanding are turned by us to what seems good to God, they will become, as it were taken from the Egyptians and from life in the world, holy and acceptable to God; for they are reformed for the use of virtue and the service of sanctification, just as indeed the vessels of gold and silver from Egypt were shown useful for the construction and completion of the holy tabernacle. After spoiling the Egyptians, and the death of the firstborn, the Israelites are redeemed with difficulty, having sacrificed the lamb as a type of Christ;<sup><a href="#fn146" id="ref146">146</a></sup> for it was not possible to achieve such a thing otherwise, since all redemption is in Christ, and every good gift is through Him.<sup><a href="#fn147" id="ref147">147</a></sup> They are sent out from the Egyptians at midnight, as it were freed from darkness and servitude together. For in intellectual darkness, and not in divine light, the slave to sin always somehow tends to be. “For everyone who does evil hates the light,”<sup><a href="#fn148" id="ref148">148</a></sup> according to the voice of the Savior. And unleavened dough is carried out, and they flee without provision. “For the Egyptians urged the people, to send them out of the land in haste. For they said, ‘We shall all die.’ And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.”<sup><a href="#fn149" id="ref149">149</a></sup> For I think those who are about to cleave to God, and have chosen intimacy with Him, must not carry a remnant of worldly wickedness, nor be furnished with alien and unholy food, clearly the intelligible ones; but to have unleavened bread is to desire henceforth the life-giving world; for such will keep the feast purely, and accomplishing the service acceptable to God, they remain under Him always.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is clear, then, that those who are God-loving and good must attain as it were a holy and sacred land, the life under Christ and free from tyranny; and they must hasten to sacrifice not in the land of the enemies, that is, not being in a sin-loving and not very blameless condition, but rather in eagerness for virtue, and in a settled character, having migrated from the tyranny of the devil.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do not suppose it is otherwise, O friend; for our discourse has been correctly made for us. But if it seems good, let us also consider these things through another image. For when those dwelling in the holy city, I mean Jerusalem, dared through running away to every foreign place to abandon the Savior God of all, they came under the hand of the Babylonians, who took them captive and commanded them to serve. For it was necessary to yield to the rulers, and unwillingly. And they, greatly distressed, and lamenting over unexpected calamities, sought sometimes to find a brief relief from the trouble. And this was, to be softened in the sharpness of their present grief by hymns to God; “I remembered God and was glad,”<sup><a href="#fn150" id="ref150">150</a></sup> the divine David said, showing a spiritual feast, the singing of hymns to God. But it seemed somehow shameful to those wishing to sing elegies and perform the accustomed things, to introduce so sweet a sound to the ears of the foreigners, and to cast their sweetest and clearest melody, as it were, into the air, while the Babylonians sometimes smiled and were altogether annoyed by the songs with instruments. Therefore they said, “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion,”<sup><a href="#fn151" id="ref151">151</a></sup> in which, according to the laws and customs of the Jews, the sacrifice of praise was offered, accomplished with strings and instruments, and charming with melodies those approaching the divine temple. But since they were strangled in a foreign yoke of servitude, lamenting they say, “On the willows in the midst of it we hung up our instruments,”<sup><a href="#fn152" id="ref152">152</a></sup> indicating through this very thing their inactivity in song. For the willow is a fruitless, or rather destructive, tree, as has been said by one of the poets among the Greeks. Therefore the instruments of song were set aside for inactivity and fruitlessness; and having cried out the occasion of their ease for this, they say, “How shall we sing the Lord’s song in a foreign land?”<sup><a href="#fn153" id="ref153">153</a></sup> And when Baruch brought them the words of Jeremiah, “They all wept,” it says, “and fasted and prayed before the Lord; and they gathered money, as each one’s hand was able; and they sent to Jerusalem to Jehoiakim the son of Hilkiah, son of Shallum the priest, and to the priests and to all the people found with him in Jerusalem.”<sup><a href="#fn154" id="ref154">154</a></sup> And after other things: “And they said, ‘Behold, we have sent you money; buy with the money burnt offerings and sin offerings, and incense, and prepare a grain offering, and offer on the altar of the Lord our God.’”<sup><a href="#fn155" id="ref155">155</a></sup> For they thought it fitting for them no longer to sacrifice, having been removed from the holy land, and acting then no longer under God, but yoked as to another and fallen under a tyrannical hand, but for those still dwelling in the holy city, who have obtained the glory of the sacred ministry, to offer the service, using, of course, right reasoning, for the consideration of what is fitting and necessary. And the most wise Daniel himself, while holding to sacred studies, and being a captive together with the others, wisely managed the matter of necessity. And in what manner, I will tell: for he was brought three times a day. But he had windows in his upper chamber open and looking toward Jerusalem.<sup><a href="#fn156" id="ref156">156</a></sup> For it is written thus. For he thought his own prayer would then be acceptable to God, if, from a foreign and hated land, if not in body perhaps, at least in thoughts he might separate himself, and with the eyes of his mind, looking toward the land most beloved to God, and as it were breathing into the temple itself, he might offer his supplication for whatever he chose.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Well indeed, truly, our whole discourse has been arranged.</p>
