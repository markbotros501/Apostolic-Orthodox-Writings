    <h1>On Adoration and Worship in Spirit and Truth, Book VI</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">Concerning the necessity of adhering to God with a free mind and whole heart, and the spiritual fortitude and strength of Christians.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Concerning Christian fortitude and spiritual strength, it seems, Palladius, we have spoken sufficiently; but we must again, I think, consider in what things these can be displayed by us.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Come then, let us turn the eyes of our mind around on every side, and diligently examine our actions, considering what path entering, we may become illustrious, and be adorned as with a crown by the approval of honorable and upright deeds. Or does it seem to you that I do not speak rightly, wanting to determine what should be approved in these matters?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Most rightly indeed: for I myself would not deny that one ought first to be incited to fortitude, and thus embrace those things through which one may become illustrious and arrive at a life free from blame.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Now therefore let us begin. The firmness of a house is the foundation; but the beginning of a ship is the keel; but the foundation and base and beginning of him who undertakes the work of virtue is the knowledge of truth, and the sincere preaching of faith in Him who is the one and natural and true God: "Unless you believe," says sacred Scripture, "you shall not understand."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> But if we understand nothing of what is necessary, we must cease from work, since we do not know how to act rightly. Or if we think we are doing rightly what must be done, do you not admit that it is necessary, for obtaining praise, to have that inquiry concerning all things to be done?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I admit it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Faith therefore is the nurse of understanding. Understanding examines the things to be done by us. And so, when the God of all gave the law through Moses to the Israelites, He placed as it were a certain pedagogue and wise guide, establishing as a certain base and firm the knowledge of the one true Divinity; for He did not think they could reach an innocent and pure life, or have their morals composed by the law which exhorted to excellent things, and easily obey the commandments, unless they had received that faith in God in their soul, fortified by it as by a wall, to resist strenuously the pleasures which drew them to laziness. There was need, there was need, I say, that those ancients first lay aside as it were a certain sickness of soul, the error by which a multitude of gods was worshiped, and be well confirmed in faith in Him who is one and by nature truly God; and therefore that first law shone forth for them: "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth. You shall not bow down to them, nor serve them. For I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, and showing mercy to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments."<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For it was necessary that they be moved by harsh terrors, who were about to block the approach to the commandments; and therefore He calls Himself a jealous God, and says He imposes the sins of parents upon children, if they wish to live similarly to them and contend with paternal faults. For we do not say that the sins of parents redound upon those who have committed no fault; since God testifies in clear words: "The fathers shall not die for the children, nor the children for the fathers; each shall die in his own sin."<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> But if children follow the opinion of parents, and have been imitators of paternal impiety, the indignation of God comes upon them also. And if it happens by His just benignity that God, who is above all, remits the punishments to those first ones, certainly to the second or third He inflicts the anger merited from the beginning by the impious generation. He compelled them therefore to fear, when He called Himself a jealous God; and He confirmed them in faith by another reason, promising that He would show mercy to thousands of those who loved Him. To this He added another related commandment, saying: "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain."<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Some were doing this, attributing the name of God to wood and stones, and stupidly casting down that name which is above every name to the workmanship and labor of human hands; concerning whom God said through the voice of Isaiah: "After the carpenter chooses wood, he sets it in measure, and composes it with glue to make the form of a man, and the beauty of a human, to set it in a house; he cuts wood from the forest, which the Lord planted, and the rain increased, to be for men to burn; and taking from it he warms himself, and they kindle it and bake bread upon it; and from the remainder they make gods, and worship them."<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> And after other things: "Know that their heart is ashes, and they err." These take the name of the Lord in vain.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Moreover, those who have now come out from the snares of the devil and have known the true God, I think ought not to limp into foolish understandings, nor in this matter foolishly embrace a degenerate sense, brought to the opinion that they acknowledge other gods, or certainly think there are any at all besides Him who is one and true. "For although there are those who are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords), yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through Him; and one Holy Spirit, in whom are all things, and we in Him."<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> For we shall not contract the nature of divinity into the one God and Father in a Jewish manner; but extending it in a certain way into the holy and consubstantial Trinity, and distinguishing by both the quality of persons and the property of hypostasis, we shall contract again into one God, on account of the same substance of the Three; and we shall serve Him, and worship Him, invoking the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. "For there shall not be," He says, "other gods besides me."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> And again, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve."<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But since the Father is one God, and the Son is one Lord, and the Holy Spirit proceeding is one, we shall not expel the one God from true dominion, nor exclude Him who is truly and by nature Lord from being God; for dominion belongs wholly to divinity according to nature, and to true dominion belongs the glory of divinity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Most rightly and most wisely said by you.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> We shall therefore know one God, Palladius, and count none at all with Him, making the impious and profane duplicity, as truly arrogant and insolent, far from our soul, lest the sacred word also cry out against us: "How long will you limp on both knees? Either Baal, or God."<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> For we must be single-minded, not double-minded and wavering, and seen to be changing most readily to what is not fitting; for to limp on both and to be unstable, I would say, is most impious. And indeed the old law also punishes the inconstant with death; for it says: "Whoever sacrifices to gods shall be utterly destroyed, except to the Lord alone."<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> Therefore to rise up against divine glory, and to attempt to distribute to those whom one chooses, and to those who are not gods by nature, what is fitting to it alone, is the foulest kind of sickness, or rather the crime of extreme impiety.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore it is necessary to be free from such vices for him who is truly genuine and God-loving; and not only to have a cleansed heart, but not even to utter from the tongue ever the name of an idol. For it is written: "You shall not remember the name of other gods, nor shall it be heard from your mouth."<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> For what is shameful to know is not harmless to speak. And everywhere those who have chosen to honor genuine faith ought to remember the blessed Paul writing thus: "For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, to renew them again to repentance."<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> For those who have once been brought through holy baptism to the reception of heavenly and divine grace, concerning the resurrection and the kingdom of Christ, and have received the true and life-giving word, if they run back to the ancient state and run under the first sickness, they shall not be renewed for purification through a second baptism; "For their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God,"<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> as the divine Paul says. Nor because some have despised and gone back from divine grace shall we ascribe inconstancy to it; but rather the judge of all ages will subject to punishments those who did not avoid slipping into this impiety, as having trampled the Son of God under foot, and regarded the blood of the covenant as common, and insulted the Spirit of grace, in which they had been sanctified and made partakers of the divine nature.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For as a soldier who has thrown away his shield and fled from battle ought not to be marked with a second character, but to be punished and pay the penalty for cowardice: in the same way, those who have been injurious to so august and admirable a grace ought not to be adorned with a second gift of the Spirit, since they have rejected the first, but to be subjected to the first. For those once enlightened ought to take up that opinion and firmness of thought, to know that He is one who is God by nature, and to execrate those who suggest anything else besides Him; and they should consider it especially desirable to leap upon idols and disturb temples, and think the deities of the Gentiles nothing; which also a passage of the old law will teach: for it is written in Numbers: "And the Lord spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan opposite Jericho, saying: Speak to the Israelites, and say to them: You shall cross over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, and you shall destroy all the inhabitants of the land before your face, and you shall take away their high places, and all their molten idols you shall destroy, and all their pillars you shall take away."<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do you understand therefore that those who cross the Jordan need to remove altars and groves from the midst, and disturb them without hesitation together with idols and pillars? For to spare such pests is a clear indication that we are not sufficiently confirmed, nor have consecrated a heart free from crime to God, openly deciding concerning impious and perverse things: "You shall not worship their gods, nor serve them; you shall not act according to their works, but destroying you shall destroy, and breaking you shall break their pillars, and you shall serve the Lord your God; and I will bless your bread, and your wine, and your water, and I will turn away sickness from you; there shall not be barrenness nor sterility in your land, I will fulfill the number of your days."<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For it is not obscure that for men well confirmed, and devoted to the God of all with an integral mind, and striving to show the most certain argument of this, this very thing, that they overthrow altars and pillars, and the toys of corrupted human minds, will secure divine gifts for them.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is true.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For if you destroy hand-made images, He says, and serve God, hating their morals, "I will bless your bread, and your wine, and your water." This is a mystical and hidden saying; for to sincere worshippers of God that communion of Christ's mysteries, and the grace of holy baptism, avails for spiritual blessing; but for those who are still double-minded, and look to apostasy and defection, there is both condemnation and a heap of all evils in the reception of that spiritual blessing: and that is, I think, what the wise man Paul said: "Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup."<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> For those who are truly lovers of God, He says, there will be that communion of the holy mysteries as a blessing; and they shall be freed from infirmity, that is, they shall not succumb to sickness and disease which lead to laziness; nor shall there be barrenness, He says, in them, nor sterility: for every God-loving and holy soul is most fruitful, and adorned with holy fruits, the glory, I say, of virtues.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> So the matter stands.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But because He does not allow us to be at all with a changeable heart, He skillfully turns us to embrace the stability of faith and firmness of piety; for sometimes leading with suitable reasons to what is better, He commands to neglect, indeed to reject, idol sacrifice and worship, as certainly leading to death, showing that such sickness is full of most serious crime, indeed of extreme impiety; sometimes opposing fear, I say the dread of punishment, as a certain stern teacher and severe guardian, He leads us on all sides to what pleases Him. Thus in Deuteronomy the blessed Moses says: "And these are the statutes and judgments which you shall keep to do in the land which the Lord God of your fathers gives you for a possession, all the days that you live on the earth. You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations served their gods, which you shall possess, on high mountains, and on hills, and under every green tree: and you shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire, and you shall cut down the carved images of their gods, and destroy their name out of that place."<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Indeed the wise among the Greeks, and the distinguished among others, especially the poets, call certain nymphs, Oreads and Hamadryads, that is, demons. There were also those who, when they wished to worship their gods on high places, were accustomed to build altars on mountains and sacrifice oxen; and when they had set up statues and images of demons around more beautiful trees, they gave themselves to slaughtering sheep. But it was necessary that men subjected to Him who is by nature and truly God, fearing nothing, should demolish the toys of erring men, and depart far from their morals. And therefore He says again: "When the Lord your God cuts off the nations which you enter to possess, from before your face, and you possess them and dwell in their land, take heed to yourself, lest you imitate them after they have been destroyed before your face; you shall not inquire after their gods, saying: As these nations did to their gods, so I will do also; you shall not do so to the Lord your God: for every abomination which the Lord hates they have done to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burned in the fire to their gods."<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For the lawgiver entirely forbids imitating the erring, and commands to depart from that impious slaughter of children, and convicts those who are bloodthirsty, and destroyers and corruptors of the human race under the name of false gods, who most foully, according to their own lust, despise even the laws of necessary affection: "For God created all things that they might exist, and the generations of the world are wholesome, and there is no poison of destruction in them. For God created no one for destruction, and the productive world is unimpaired. But by the envy of the devil death entered into the world."<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> And the divine will overturns death, and destroys destruction, and does not allow things that exist to perish; for He created all things that they might exist, as it is written: but those who have been drawn by the covetousness of demons as by nets to error, offer to Satan as condiments and most fragrant incense the destruction of those who were born to live, and the death of those who were created to exist.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Most beautifully therefore He shows that their morals are full of most serious crimes, and that nature is violated among them, and the laws of desirable love for children are trampled; so that He most suitably turns the noble mind of the hearers, hostile to vices, to embrace and bravely seize what He Himself would wish and command. And these things were decreed long ago for overturning their impiety. Moreover, He sanctioned with extreme punishment if anyone should attempt to lead away a confirmed man who had piously received the knowledge of truth. For thus He says again: "If there arises among you a prophet, or a dreamer of a dream, and gives you a sign or a wonder, and the sign or wonder comes to pass of which he spoke to you, saying: Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known; you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of a dream; for the Lord your God is testing you, to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. You shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear Him, and keep His commandments, and obey His voice, and you shall serve Him, and cleave to Him. And that prophet, or that dreamer of a dream, shall be put to death, because he has spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God."<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">How just is this law, and fitting to God! For if murderers of bodies must altogether and entirely be put to death according to laws, how would not he reasonably be in danger who brings destructive error to the soul, and casts into pits of destruction what is better than the body, according to the voice of the Savior Himself? God therefore justly decreed that the punishment for bloodshed should be inflicted on the deceiver and impostor; and He decrees the same punishment similarly against those who have applied a light and fickle mind to such men. For when it was very easy, if they wished to think rightly, to escape, why, he says, did they voluntarily run to destruction? "But if there be found in one of your cities, which the Lord your God gives you, a man or woman who does evil in the sight of the Lord your God, to transgress His covenant, and goes and serves other gods, and worships them, the sun or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded, and it is told you, and you inquire diligently, and behold it is true, that such an abomination has been committed in Israel; you shall bring out that man or that woman, who has committed that wicked thing, and you shall stone them with stones, and they shall die. On the evidence of two witnesses or three witnesses he shall die that is to die; he shall not be put to death on the evidence of one witness. The hand of the witnesses shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So you shall purge the evil from your midst."<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For when God has been wronged concerning His own worship, it is not safe to be moved to mercy; but it is altogether harmful to soften into ignoble mutual affection at an inappropriate time; and this, I think, is what the Lord said: "He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me."<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> For let the law of natural affection yield, and let the power of natural love depart, and whatever pertains to philanthropy, and as we may say, let God be worshiped with pious severity. Or do you not say it is pious that those who have no excuse for apostasy should be punished without mercy, as abandoning the glory beyond all things, and daring to insult Him whom it would be better to please with efforts toward stability?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is pious; how could it not be?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But I remember Him saying to the ancients: "What wrong did your fathers find in me, that they went far from me, and went after vanity, and became vain?"<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> And marveling at the sons of Israel as at sheer folly, He says thus: "The heavens are shocked at this, and the earth shuddered exceedingly, says the Lord; for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and hewed out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water."<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For I would think they erred from all good counsel, and very reasonably, who departing from the worship of God, serve the creature rather than the Creator and Maker; or rushing into a yet more shameful error, they worship the works of their hands. And yet it was easy, if they chose to think rightly, to contemplate the beauty of the nature above all and ineffable from the creation of the world, and from the harmony of created things to conceive of the commander and leader and maker of this universe. But some of those ancients, spitting out counsel so venerable and admirable, offered, as is among the Greek poets, golden calves for gods. Therefore, having cast aside the worship of God, who is by nature true, they turned childishly to the useless and vain cult of idols. And so they sprinkled shame worthy of laughter on their own head, and embraced of their own accord the destitution of heavenly aid. And therefore God said: "As the thief is shamed when he is caught, so the house of Israel is shamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets; who say to a tree: You are my father; and to a stone: You gave me birth. For they have turned their back to me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they say: Arise and save us. But where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you in your time of trouble; for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to Baal. Why do you speak to me? You have all transgressed against me, says the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> A grave crime indeed, Cyril.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But there is someone, I think, sometimes from our number still not very confirmed, who feigns a false and simulated love for Christ, and has put on as it were a sheep's skin, namely that he may seem to be a lover of God, while he is earthly, and a monstrous beast, also malignant and various; so that at home and by night, secretly, I say, he is given to the cult of demons; yet the same, as is likely, thinks he can escape God Himself, and deceive the understanding of that ineffable nature. But it can easily be shown that he who thinks thus thinks more shameful things than the folly of the Gentiles. For among the wise of the Greeks, the sun, which is created and made, that great luminary, and created by God for this very purpose, seems rightly to see all things and hear all things: for they thought that what was received as God ought to be endowed with the properties of divine nature: but the property of supreme nature is to know and perceive all things. But they indeed thought so: but God cried out to us: "I am a God at hand, says the Lord, and not a God far away. Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him?"<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup> For nothing can be hidden from Him who is by nature and truly God. And the divine David will teach us, saying: "Understand, you senseless among the people; and you fools, when will you be wise? He who planted the ear, does He not hear? He who formed the eye, does He not see?"<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> For some said foolishly: "The Lord does not see; the God of Jacob does not understand."<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup> Is it not the height of folly to say that He does not know who is the giver of knowledge, and to think that He does not hear who gave this sense to the things He created?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Utterly absurd.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore the Lord God alone must be worshiped, according to the Scriptures, and wholly; but another besides Him, none. For it is written: "You shall be perfect before the Lord your God."<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup> Spiritual perfection is being established in faith, and blameless in worship, and the irreproachable beauty of love for God.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> So I say.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Shall we then, Palladius, free from blame and accusation those who have least chosen to worship other gods, or rather the creature than the Creator, but who nevertheless, I know not by what reasoning, obey the false prophecies of idolaters? Or is it safe to declare free from the charges of apostasy those who are truly genuine?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> By no means.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Astrology and omens and false prophecies and demonic deceptions, I think, belong only to those who have most extremely desired to introduce into their mind the ignoble and accursed idolatry.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly. For indeed the divine word instructs us that we must abhor the shamefulness toward such. It goes thus: "When you come into the land which the Lord your God gives you, you shall not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations. There shall not be found among you anyone who burns his son or his daughter as an offering, anyone who practices divination, a soothsayer, or an augur, or a sorcerer, or a charmer, or a medium, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup> And after other things He says again: "You shall be blameless before the Lord your God. For these nations, which you are about to dispossess, give heed to soothsayers and to diviners; but as for you, the Lord your God has not allowed you so to do. The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brethren—him you shall heed—just as you desired of the Lord your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly."<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Well said, friend. For we shall follow not portent-observers and necromancers, nor shall we accept the flight of birds as something true, whether they bear to the right or to the left, or toward evening or toward dawn; for these are the utmost folly. But making Christ the leader of all, the prophet for us according to us, we shall receive from Him the knowledge of necessary things, and we shall attend to Him, saying that the false speeches of demons are far off and to be rejected. For to Him alone, as to God who ought to give life and rule all things, by nature and properly belongs to God alone; so that, as I think, to have knowledge of all things is also proper to His nature; but it is proper to His nature to know future things clearly and to hold, as if gathered in Himself, the knowledge of all things. Or does it seem to you that we speak insufficiently wisely and truly?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Not at all; indeed, most fully.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore we shall sin against Him, and our crime will pertain to injury of that supreme glory, if we believe that the qualities with which He is adorned and is most distinguished belong to impure and unclean spirits. For then it will be permitted for those thinking foolishly to suspect that Satan can also bestow life and even be the Creator, if we grant not only to him what are most excellent of all and properly attributed to the divine nature, but even say that they are inherent in his nature. But it is proper and exceptional to that highest nature to know future things. Or is what I say not true?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Indeed most fully; for He says through the voice of Isaiah to those who attributed the things of God to creation: “Remember these things, and groan; repent, you who err; and return in heart, and remember the former things from of old, that I am God, and there is no other besides me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, ‘My counsel shall stand, and I will do all that I please.’”<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup> For to show that there is no other besides Himself who is by nature and truly God, He added that as evidence to the hearers, namely that He could declare the end before it happens.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You have spoken excellently, Palladius. But I would like that we diligently examine the truth further, and consider this: by what reasoning, if we are counted among those who wish to live rightly and evangelically, we follow the assertions of false divinations; and being thus intent, as if something true were spoken by them, how do we not condemn the voice of our Savior as false? For He said indeed to the arrogant and proud Jews: “You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you wish to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and did not stand in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own; for he is a liar and the father of it.”<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup> How then, he who is a liar, will ever be truthful? Or how is he not wholly a liar, who did not stand in the truth of good? Therefore, Palladius, will it not now be abhorrent to anyone, if we ascribe truth to the voices of demons, that we would condemn Christ as a liar and call the truth a liar?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> We would not be far from it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Moreover (for I will add this also to what has been said), we have learned from Christ not to admit the words of impure spirits, even if they wish to bring forth inaccessible and unusual truth.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How do you assert this?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do we not truly read in the holy evangelists, who wrote that demons came to Christ, crying out with a loud voice: “What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us before the time? We know who you are, the Holy One of God.” And it says, “He rebuked them, not permitting them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ.”<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> And yet, for what reason (for one might rightly wonder) did Christ rebuke them when they proclaimed the truth? But first the event was going to be useful for us. For by this we are taught that we ought not to believe their words, even if they wish to proclaim the truth itself and say things that are evidently true; for sometimes inserting falsehoods among truths, they harm the hearers: not dissimilarly, as it seems to me, we see some do who, by the admixture of honey, remove the sense of bitter things, and by the infusion of sweetness wish to secretly steal the taste of what is unpleasant.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore it is indeed dangerous to be devoted to the impostures of diviners.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Indeed this is punished by God and reckoned among the worst crimes. For thus it is written in Leviticus: “And the soul that turns to those having a Pythonic spirit and to enchanters, to go whoring after them, I will set my face against that soul and will destroy it from among its people. And you shall be holy to me; for I the Lord your God am holy.”<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> And after other things again: “And a man or a woman, whoever among them has a Pythonic spirit or is an enchanter, shall surely die; they shall stone them with stones; their blood is upon them.”<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> For He forbade, first, that those who follow false divinations from the observation of stars or the dead should be considered alien to holy conversation, asserting that such a thing is most abhorrent to those devoted to God; then He established extreme punishment against others, and says they are guilty, not permitting those who have advanced to this crime to become a snare of death and a net of innocent souls, and the pit of perdition and the depths of hell, and such a pestilence that mercy be shown to them by us. But I think this is wisely and truly understood: that so severe a punishment, which surpasses all evils, was not established by God against those who can know and declare future things to others and predict something truly about future events. For the word of truth is not punished; but to lie is execrable. If anyone does this and is caught as if by God’s authority, he undoubtedly casts calumny upon the very ineffable nature; and so, since he attributes falsehood to truth itself, as if pertaining to it, he will pay penalties equal to his crimes and go into perdition. For Scripture does not establish penalties for those who predict the future from God—far be it! For that order of holy prophets is excepted from punishment—but for those who feign those things as if from God, who do not even make the office of prediction free from falsehood. Therefore, because they do not offend against truth.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Shall we then discern in this whether it is God who has given the response, or whether they speak from themselves?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Indeed most fully; for divine law will persuade us of this also. For thus God said in Deuteronomy: “But if anyone says in his heart, ‘How shall we know the word which the Lord has not spoken?’ whatever that prophet says in the name of the Lord, and it is not done or does not come to pass, that is the word which the Lord has not spoken; the prophet has spoken it presumptuously.”<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup> You understand that from the failure of predicted things the truest argument is taken, that nothing was predicted from God; for truth is a friend of truth. Something of this sort also He said through the voice of Jeremiah: “I am a God at hand, says the Lord, and not a God far off. If a man hides himself in secret places, shall I not see him? Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the Lord. I have heard what the prophets said who prophesy lies in my name…”<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup> Then, after interposing a grave accusation of those contemptuous of divine laws, He brings forward, as evident proof, the very hope of truth. For He says again: “The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he who has my word, let him speak my word faithfully.”<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup> For if anything is seen to disagree from truth, that very thing will immediately betray its parent and author as a liar, and speaking from his own heart, not from the mouth of the Lord, as it is written.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Does it please you that we propose something which must necessarily be sought, or shall we let it go and rather proceed where your speech leads?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But indeed, Palladius, we do not consider what is necessary for utility among the least things; therefore, I would think it reprehensible if anything seems to be brought forth less freely, and that with the best right. Therefore, speaking nothing fearful, say whatever you wish.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> If some do not speak from the mouth of the Lord, but belch forth, as you say, from their own heart, by what means then did the Pythoness, that woman, produce holy Samuel, though already dead, to Saul, to explain to him the outcome of future things? For some think that this is so done and did not happen otherwise.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do you also think the matter stands thus, and judge it more correctly? Or do you say ridiculously that the soul of the just man was compelled to come forth and came at the calling of the little woman?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I do not have it ascertained what to say; but, unless I am mistaken, inquiry will declare what is true.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You speak rightly. Therefore let us first diligently investigate this, whether these portents are produced and effected by the gift of God, by those who study such things, or by the work of evil spirits.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Who indeed would arrive at such inept thoughts as to think that the works of necromancers and pythons and enchanters are works of God? For I will recount the law that decrees extreme punishment for whoever dares to do these things. But how is it not madness to think that he who is condemned to death does not displease God? For He is not to be thought to fight against His own laws.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> You reason excellently. Now shall we think that the souls of holy men, which have departed from bodies, are despised and held in no account, and thus come into such miseries that they are even subject to wicked spirits and follow them unwillingly wherever they wish, being carried about with no difficulty? But that wise John, who wrote the book of Revelation, approved by the judgment of the Fathers, plainly confirms that he saw the souls of the saints under the very altar of God.<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup> But if they drag them also from those heavenly dwellings and bring them down from sacred places securely, with no one forbidding, first indeed access to heaven is open to all demons, then, as follows, the gate of paradise is open to them; besides, that flaming sword—for so it seems to follow—not only gives them free entrance and exit, but also permits them, if they wish, to lead out some who have entered there. Is this not, then, to mock the hope we have in Christ? And to show that the life of admirable men is most wretched?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> So it seems.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But the same is by no means obscure. How, however, was it better for the blessed Paul to be dissolved and to be with Christ?<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup> For if after we depart from earthly things and are with Christ, we are to be subjected to adverse spirits, faith is made empty, as it is written;<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup> and to be in the body, than to be with Christ, anyone, I think, will judge far better hereafter; and, which is also less tolerable from this very fact, if, while we are still in this life, we are not subject to the desires of the devil, but rather tread upon serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy, according to the word of our Savior.<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup> Therefore, when we are with Christ, how shall we be in a worse condition? How also will He Himself be truthful when He says: “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand.”<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup> And indeed the most blessed Peter also deceives, as it were, the athletes of piety in Christ, when he wrote thus: “Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls to a faithful Creator.”<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup> But if Satan seizes a soul commended to God, and drives and carries it wherever he wishes at the time, how can that protector of the saints, who has received the spirit of each as a deposit committed, be understood as faithful? Therefore these things are nonsense, or rather monstrous stupor, to think that the prophet’s soul was truly dragged down from its assigned seat by the cold incantations of a most wicked little woman.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What then will be the explanation of the matters we have proposed for consideration? For I think such foul things are not to be admitted even in simple thoughts, so to speak.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Setting forth the sacred Scripture text, we will then make clear what comes to mind, everywhere diligently retaining what is fitting. It reads thus: “And Samuel died; and all Israel lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, in his own city. And Saul had removed the mediums and the wizards from the land. And the Philistines gathered and came and encamped in Shunem. And Saul gathered all the men of Israel and encamped in Gilboa. And Saul saw the camp of the Philistines and was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. And Saul inquired of the Lord, and the Lord did not answer him, either by dreams, or by Urim, or by prophets. And Saul said to his servants, ‘Seek for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire through her.’ And his servants said to him, ‘Behold, there is a woman who is a medium at Endor.’ And Saul disguised himself and put on other garments, and went, he and two men with him, to the woman by night; and he said to her, ‘Divine for me by the medium, and bring up for me whomever I shall name to you.’ And the woman said to him, ‘Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the wizards from the land. Why then are you laying a snare for my life to cause my death?’ And Saul swore to her by the Lord, saying, ‘As the Lord lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.’ And the woman said to Saul, ‘Whom shall I bring up for you?’ And he said, ‘Bring up Samuel for me.’ And the woman saw Samuel, and cried out with a loud voice. And the woman said to Saul, ‘Why have you deceived me? You are Saul.’ And the king said to her, ‘Do not be afraid; tell me what you have seen.’ And the woman said to him, ‘I saw gods ascending out of the earth.’ And he said to her, ‘What is his appearance?’ And she said, ‘An old man is coming up, and he is covered with a robe.’ And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and paid homage. And Samuel said to Saul, ‘Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up?’ And Saul answered, ‘I am in great distress; for the Philistines are warring against me, and God has departed from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.’ And Samuel said, ‘Why then do you ask me, since the Lord has departed from you and has become your enemy? The Lord has done to you as he spoke by me; for the Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, David. Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord and did not carry out his fierce wrath against Amalek, therefore the Lord has done this thing to you this day. Moreover the Lord will give Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me. The Lord will give the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.’”<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Can you doubt thereafter that Saul was condemned by his own sentence? For when he greatly feared the forces of those gathered against him for battle, he wished to learn from God what would happen; but He being silent, he turned to the offense of Him who had decided to be silent. Therefore he goes to the woman practicing necromancy; and he calls the wizards from the land, who think they know the future. Then he says: “Bring up Samuel for me,” not because the force of chants or magical art was such that it could summon the soul of a holy man, but because diviners always use such words. But I have heard that they entice demons with certain secret words; and, by enchanting water, they behold images and shadows, and as it were certain forms in a mirror, demons evidently aptly fashioning shapes for them, who are said to be summoned. Therefore first that woman said: “I saw gods ascending from the earth.” Then she said: “The woman saw Samuel.”<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup> Nothing forbids that a shadow and image was seen, formed in a figure very similar to the blessed Samuel by the work of demons. But if anyone thinks that the prophet’s soul was truly summoned, and attributes truth to the woman’s words; therefore, since she said she saw gods ascending from the earth, let him not pardon falsehood to the custom of divination; but let him think that there are truly certain gods of such order, who exist from the earth; although according to nature God is one and alone.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> That indeed is rightly said by you. But perhaps someone will say: Yet she spoke truth, when Saul asked what would happen. But a not insignificant part of our discourse has been consumed in proving that truth does not exist in impure spirits.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> No, I say. For light and darkness, Christ and Belial, cannot be composed or joined together.<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup> But God reveals future things to those who provoke and often offend, sometimes even through those who are least suitable, through dreams to the human soul, through holy angels, and if they learn who are curious inquirers, they become very sorrowful; and by that foreknowledge they are tormented as by certain firstfruits of imminent evils. For in the holy prophets He dwells and often communicates not only sad things, which could cause one to mourn and lie in grief, but also whatever will be happy and joyful for some; but to the impious and nefarious students of divinations God opens the evils that will befall them.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But how, or whence can this be proven?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> From the sacred Scriptures themselves, for what happened to those ancient people were written to be figures for us and a way that we might be mystically instructed. Are you ignorant that Balak the son of Zippor, that tyrant of the Moabites and Midianites, when he feared the strong and invincible multitude of Israel, and thought he would soon perish together with the other nations, hired Balaam for an agreed reward? “Come,” he said, “and curse Israel.” And when the messengers came, he said, “Lodge here tonight, and I will bring back word to you, as the Lord speaks to me.”<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup> And when he sought cold dreams sent by demons, and what used to happen to him from chants and magical arts, he separated, he said the Lord would speak with him; for he pretended to hear God. Although sacred Scripture uses the customary words of enchanters, we will not wisely think that He who is by nature and truly God, as if from the cave of profane men, injects truth into minds, and wishes to speak with a most wicked man, a magician, and an idolater. Nevertheless, “God came to Balaam and said to him, ‘Who are these men with you?’”<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup> And when he explained the reason for their coming: “The Lord said to Balaam, ‘Do not go with them; do not curse the people, for they are blessed.’”<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup> Behold now plainly the blessed angel from the person of God turned away that deceiver and trifling magician, lest he dare to curse him who is blessed by God, and oppose the divine decrees with the contrivances of a human and unhappy decision: not because that curse could harm anything; but that openly and manifestly he who had been foolishly led into hope of such a kind might also be made more certain through him, that it would never come to pass that Israel would be conquered by the Moabites or Midianites, to whom God was protector and defender, who would guard the people blessed and dedicated to Him with His benignity. And these things indeed the blessed angel said and commanded to be done. But after that same wicked man was enticed by promised gifts, because perhaps he thought he would truly perform it, the angel indeed permitted him to go; but in the middle of the way he was seen with a shining sword: in which he clearly taught him that, if he wished to curse those who were blessed, he would undertake war against God and against the angels. After he came to the Midianite, he built altars and ordered oxen to be sacrificed, and already he became a prophet, not as he used to be before, deceived, but by divine and infallible power he was turned contrary to expectation. For he did not curse, but blessed Israel, and cast Balak into bitter grief. For thus it is written: “Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, ‘I called you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them these three times.’ And Balaam said to Balak, ‘Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me, “If Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold, I would not be able to go beyond the word of the Lord, to do either good or bad of my own will; what the Lord says, that I will speak”?’”<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup> For false diviners are accustomed to use such deceitful words also, and to pretend that they will respond wholly truthfully to inquirers. So therefore hold that to speak truth is wholly alien to the art of enchanters and magicians; but sometimes it happens that truth is added by God, so that the minds of nefarious men may be vehemently punished by the prediction of future things.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I agree.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For that God hates such magical disciplines or rashly uttered words, and dissolves them, will be clear from His words when He says: “I am the Lord God,”<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup> and besides this: “Who will frustrate the signs of the ventriloquists and the divinations from the heart, turning the wise backward and making their counsel foolish? And confirming the words of His servant and performing the counsel of His messengers.”<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup> For He shows the divinations cast from the heart to be vain and false; but He confirms all the words of His servant, that is, Christ; moreover, the counsel of His messengers, that is, whatever the heralds who have faith in Him wish to speak, these He demonstrates to be full of all truth, attesting to them with signs and wonders and other operations of the Holy Spirit. He said again, rebuking some for doing things disapproved by God’s law: “Stand now in your enchantments and in the multitude of your sorceries, which you have learned from your youth; perhaps you may be able to profit, perhaps you may prevail. You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels; let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators stand up and save you from the things that shall come upon you.”<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup> You see therefore how God convicts that execrable divination from observation of the stars as worthy of laughter and wholly useless. But that truth, by which things hoped to happen certainly are predicted, belongs to Him alone, know from this that He speaks through the voice of Isaiah: “Remember this, and groan; repent, you who err; return in heart, and remember the former things from of old; for I am God, and there is no other besides me; declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, ‘My counsel shall stand, and I will do all that I please.’”<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup> Therefore to God alone, who is above all, must be attributed by us both to know future things plainly and also to predict them certainly; but the futile and empty tales, also deceitful and illusory, which proceed from others, who being corrupt in mind, speak from their own heart, as it is written, and seek opportunity for gain from falsehood.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is true. For so the matter stands wholly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore we shall abstain also from this thing; and leaving the perverse way, we shall walk in the right; and always imitate God in the same way, and attribute truth to the voices of holy men.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Indeed most fully.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> What? Shall we not also think that besides this, that which is to be purged by fire and water is execrable, and say it is part of Gentile impiety, and other such things?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Most truly. Therefore divine law said: “There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire.”<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> How rightly that law pronounced to us, and forbade doing it! For that thing, I think, is full of temerity and devoid of the best reason and wisdom. For what benefit can the nature of fire bring to us? How also does the agitation of torches in a circle free the one who has sinned? Indeed the force of fire burns out the filth of some material; but how does it consume the impurity of mind or soul? Are not these things, then, ridiculous and contrivances of vain thoughts?</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> So wholly.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But most willingly to those who are held distinguished among the Greeks, who both invented such foul institutions and handed them down to others, I would indeed say: What is your counsel? You, outstanding and wise men, I call, when you torment that Tityus, whom you say born from earth, in the underworld, and apply vultures that feed on his liver as if at a banquet, because he admired the form of a woman and suffered from the disease of lust? And you say a stone hangs over Tantalus, and he pays the penalty of intemperate tongue, as you fabulously relate to boys? Ixion also you say is bound to perpetual wheel rotations and atones for that deceit which displeased your gods; but yourselves and others, although held in most grave and foul evils, you free by fire and branches, as you think; and grant ablution of crimes to the most wicked men? But to Tityus, I ask, and those I just named, perhaps lack of fire imposed such bitter penalties? Yet according to your opinion, would we be thieves, who say Prometheus brought fire to men, if indeed he existed at all, the use of fire is from God; and indeed before others: yet they sing that he also was bound with chains so firm they cannot be broken; and indeed, vultures with hooked claws flew to him, as also to Tityus, evidently foul and monstrous birds. Give then, give, that not only they, but if any of you have lusted madly for the wives of other men and have committed what is not lawful, let it be permitted to them also to be freed from guilt through fire, not only from foul deeds, but also to emerge from forensic judgments. But in other cases immediately judgments and accusations, and the severity of laws is borne and brandished as avenger of wickedness; but yourselves, although you follow a most foul and foul-smelling life, yet deceived by cold and childish plays, you think to wipe away all stain, and you take as ministers for this matter men most wicked of all, who together with dress cast off also manly speech, and debase bodies and senses to the affections and manners of women. In what way, then, will he who is of such a sort expiate crimes? For thus affected, you will do something similar, as if someone, when he wishes to anoint himself with perfumes, smeared with most stinking mud, thinks he has accomplished, and indeed excellently, what he intended.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly; for indeed I agree with you speaking truth.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> I pass over, therefore, the madness of these in this matter, and for now I am silent about those ministers of purgation; and I return again to the proposed matter: and I also say that the worshipers of idols can be discovered to have established life with the highest ignorance and foolishness, and not to have understood the reckoning of more splendid crimes, nor explored what is truly stain and impurity. For adulteries and vices even more monstrous than these: intercourse with males and murders, detractions and envies, lies and deceits, frauds and thefts, perjuries, are stains and pollutions that infect soul and body, and can scarcely be washed away and cast off. But neither fire nor springs of water will have wiped these away. Therefore, since they do not even care to know that these pollute the mind and fill it with worst odor, they flee from corpses and execrate corrupted bodies. In this they despise the laws of nature; moreover, they wisely, as they think, disapprove of foods they wish; and if perhaps it happens that they touch even against their will, they immediately recoil and hasten to lustration by fire or water; as if if they abstain from these alone, they will be holy and pure, so occupied are they by this opinion and made powerless in mind. Against whom it can be said, and indeed aptly: “Woe to you, unrestrained and foolish, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel!”<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup> For they labor not at all about that which truly is accustomed to pollute; they vainly dread those things by which no one is affected by any inconvenience. Therefore, if any of them goes to a monument and has been among the sepulchers of dead men, he must cast off the garment, shave the head, even the head itself; scraping him as if impure. By these things we are taught that we must withdraw and beware lest we imitate them, as divine law taught. For He said again: “You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you.”<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup> For the distinguished writers of the Gentiles fabricate Apollo as a god, whom they also call Phoebus, that is, pure and unpolluted, and say that he is the same as the sun. Therefore they used to say, and again from the Greek manner of speaking, that which is to be purified and cleansed, as they themselves think, and as is in their laws. From these therefore so foul and disgraceful observances the divine response restrains us; for it is not fitting to think that the death of bodies is a pollution of the soul, or to think that stains are imprinted on the hearts of the onlookers by the sight of a corpse; nor on that account to shave; for that is most vain and full of the most abject opinion. Most excellently therefore the law says: “You shall not purify yourselves;” for such purification does not help the soul, but rather harms it; for it takes away the knowledge of the most useful way, and leads us away from the investigation of what is useful. For let us consider this reasoning: There are laws among us of those who hold power on earth, which command all men everywhere what should be done, and forbid the contrary; but no one will be able to escape the penalties appointed for their violation, unless he is pardoned by the kindness of the emperor. By the same reasoning, he who has despised the divine laws cannot become pure, unless he has obtained it by the benefit of the divine will. For if we have violated the laws of fire or water, and the account of sin pertains to those, let water wash away the fault, let fire burn away the filth; let them pardon crimes by their own right, for whom they wish; but if He is truthful who says to the Lord: “Against you only have I sinned, and done evil in your sight,”<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup> (for there is one lawgiver and judge) for what reason, with Him set aside, in whose power is both punishing and pardoning, do they descend to foolish inventions, attributing that faculty to fire and water, so that they think they can absolve from faults? Away with this temerity, I beg; approach Him who alone is God by nature, and you will immediately hear Him saying: “I am he who blots out your sins for my own sake, and I will not remember.”<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup> This is true purification, this spiritual splendor: for we have been washed, we have obtained remission of sins in Christ; we have been sanctified also by the washing of regeneration, and enriched by the divine grace of the Holy Spirit, who like fire consumes the stains that rush into our souls, like chaff. And therefore rightly says the Scripture inspired by God, that we are baptized with the Holy Spirit and fire.<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Shall we therefore count this error also among idolatries?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Certainly indeed. For the matter is full of impiety. And to these may rightly be joined and numbered the opinion that human affairs are governed by the nods of others, and that the power of our actions does not depend on ourselves, but on those whom the inventors of such absurd dogmas pleased to fabricate. For Fate and Fortune and Birth, I know not how, imposing them as certain helmsmen upon human life, they assert that each of us is not the author and master of things to be done; but is driven as by a necessary bond at the will of the ruling powers. What then can be more irrational than such a thing? And what greater injury could Satan have inflicted upon the human race than when he persuaded them that they ought to think and reason in this manner? For how could anyone ever deliberate about the best things, and willingly undertake them? And indeed, he who has been engaged in foul deeds, and pursued with inclined mind what he ought not, how will he accuse himself, and, melting with sorrow, change his purpose to both thinking and doing better things? For as those who wish to cross the sea and sail must of necessity be driven by the winds from the stern, and be carried everywhere in the direction of the pushing blast; so also we ourselves must necessarily yield to wherever Fortune wishes to carry us, and to the inevitable, as they think, spirits of Fate. Do you not think this has been rightly said by us?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Why should I not think so?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Is it not then utterly foolish to crown a good and modest man with praises, and deem him worthy of honor, but to consider a wicked and intemperate man vile and contemptible?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> In what way do you say this?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Because, Palladius, according to them, Birth and Fortune have conquered, and both unwillingly bring forth the most wretched race of men on earth. Nothing among us is voluntary. For what? Is not that which is naturally capable and able to move the cause of motion for those things that are moved by it?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I affirm it.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Proceed therefore through the same concepts to human affairs, and measure our matters: so you will very well perceive in what heap of evils we lie, if we do not walk and hasten hither and thither by our own voluntary nods; but are held as it were, and subjected to the yoke of others, who are able to drive and carry our affairs wherever they wish. For if we think consistently, we will attribute to ourselves no part of the things to be done, but rather assign the causes of all things to those who, as a helmsman holding the rudder, are accustomed to impel us according to their will. Therefore, as the just man will be removed from all praise, so the unjust will be removed from punishment and penalty.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You conclude most rightly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore the inventors of such dogmas rashly admire that Solon at Athens, and also Draco and Lycurgus, as authors of the best disciplines, as if they had discovered most excellent laws for the Greeks. For what advantage is there in that, if nothing is in our power; but rather all our affairs depend on the nod of others? And by the same weight, and in the same place, will be he who has been ignorant of the laws, as he who knows them, if no faculty of freely doing what they wish is given to those willing. Moreover, I declare that the authors of laws were the most unjust of men, although they acquired for themselves the greatest reputation of justice. For they decreed that the idle and negligent were to be punished by some means, and wished to impose severe penalties for violated laws; but to boys they handed down certain rules, and ways of life most worthy of praise; and they did this either because they thought that living an honest life was within our faculty; or they followed some other plan. But someone, I think, might say: You indeed handed down laws excellently, O Solon, to the men of that age; but you ought also to have persuaded Fate to permit those who received the laws to think and do what they wished. But you, laboring not at all about persuading, established laws: for you yourself were mocking this fable, and you knew that the faculty of doing things was in us, and you rejected this unjust and blind Fortune of human actions; otherwise you would never have thought that a good man indeed should be held as such who was both pious and a keeper of the laws, and had reached the highest glory of probity; and again, that a useless man, and to be counted among the most base, who, when the laws urged the right way of life, had despised great safety.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Most elegantly and excellently.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But what, Palladius; shall we not say that the instructions and admonitions of boys, and also exhortations to virtue, which parents apply to children and teachers to those coming to them, are vain, if it is forced that we do not enter the path according to our judgment, and sometimes hold to a path of life alien to our will?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And indeed most greatly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> If someone is moreover moved against his own boys, or any others, and applies a rebuke to them, would you praise such a man, or think him unjust, who by some plan would allow the authors of all our ills to go away unreproached, but would think that those who are led to these things against their will and by necessity should be punished?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak justly; for the speech has great probability.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But that this opinion is full of the greatest impiety, you will learn from this: for when they cast down God from the glory that He has, as a certain governor and ruler of this universe, and proceed to such audacity that they strip Him wholly of His own ornaments; they ascribe the power of our affairs to those things that come upon us by chance; although all creation is seen to tend to its own bounds not without a moderator. For what is done disorderly in creation? What of existing things does not preserve its own order, and almost cry out the chief of order? And when it is subjected to law and is governed by the nods of Him who has the power to contain, namely God. Therefore also the divine Paul says: “For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Claiming to be wise, they became fools.”<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup> For how did they not become fools, who persuade both themselves and others to think other things than what is right? And yet, what would anyone say floats in such wretched reasonings, when this fabrication is not even pleasing to your own poets? For it seemed to them that the management of actions depends not on any others, but on ourselves. And indeed Homer in his poems says that your most excellent and supreme Jupiter spoke with the other gods about the adultery of Aegisthus, and about the penalty due to him:</p>

        <blockquote style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 20px 0;">Why then do mortals blame the gods?<br>
        They say evils come from us; but they themselves,<br>
        By their own recklessness, suffer pains beyond fate.</blockquote>

        <p class="paragraph">But indeed, he says, therefore they accuse some gods as having evils from them, and do not rather cry out their own sins, as being the causes of misfortunes, and those beyond measure, and those beyond Fate, or what seems to Fate. Therefore if anyone should determine to live rightly, and to spend his time in this life most wisely and moderately, he will walk straight and escape dangers, having the fruit of right and uncorrupted judgment, not to be entangled in evils; and this saying is true. For it is in our own faculty to look to whichever side we wish, I mean to good and to the contrary; and those who are intent on what is by nature admirable and the path of rectitude, will be in the enjoyment of virtue; but those who have turned to the contrary side, and preferred wrongdoing to better things, destroying their own life, will be held as authors and terrible destroyers of their own head. That it is in our power to look to either side, as I said, and while we gape at pleasures, we miss the hunt of advantageous things, can become clear from the testimony of another of their poets: this is Euripides. For he presents a woman on the stage laboring with the disease of intemperate pleasure; then somehow he introduces her philosophizing and saying:</p>

        <blockquote style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin: 20px 0;">O you who inhabit these furthest borders of Pelops' land,<br>
        Women of Troezen, often with me, while slow night passes,<br>
        I have anxiously sought this: how and by what causes<br>
        The life of mortals is corrupted.<br>
        And it seems to me they are not led to evil by the nature of their mind;<br>
        For many have good sense.<br>
        But this, I think, is the origin of all evil:<br>
        We know and recognize all useful things,<br>
        But we do not carry them out: some by idleness,<br>
        Others while preferring pleasure to honor,<br>
        Either this or that; for life has many pleasures:<br>
        Long conversations, and leisure, a sweet evil.</blockquote>

        <p class="paragraph">Do you understand that Fortune, Birth, and Fate do not seem to those ancients to be blamed, as if they force us from right judgment, and from those things we have learned to be honorable? For the life of mortals is corrupted, he says, not by the nature of the mind, that is, not because they have a mind evil by nature; but because they are unwilling to carry out through labor what they have rightly perceived. And what is the cause of this? For either idleness, he says, has hindered them so that they cling to leisure; or some pleasure of life stealing upon them, and opposing the reasoning of utility, has led them away from the hunt of necessary things, and diverted the mind elsewhere; suggesting an easier path that tends to idleness. We could have added countless things from their authors, and indeed very easily. But who would doubt that the same things are pleasing to hearers which are sufficient? Therefore we shall avoid weariness of speech.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly. But, if you wish, they say, let these things go: consider rather how you may answer wisely, if any ask you, what reason can be thought of for this inequality and confusion among us, which often turns everything upside down and contrary to reason: for one may see a perverse man fortunate and rich, and on the other hand often a good man, and worthy of the highest praises, involved in contrary things.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> That is indeed obscure and very difficult, Palladius, and to wish to investigate it, in my opinion, goes beyond and surpasses the measure of human nature: for it is necessary to yield to divine judgments. And, if we wish to think rightly, we shall attribute the knowledge of this governance to that supreme and incorruptible mind alone; we shall proceed rather to those things that are at hand, which even with labor are scarcely found by us, as the Scriptures relate. But, because this reasoning must, I think, be defended by us when opportunity is given: come, let us also approach that. We were refuting a little while ago the vain opinion of impious men, when by not foreign but necessary arguments we showed that the rudders of the human mind are not in the power of Birth, nor is the hard and inevitable yoke of Fate imposed on us: but the power of things that are by choice is in the judgment of each, and it is in us ourselves to undertake to do whatever seems good, whether it be good or evil. Indeed I would reckon happiness, and they who rightly judge approve, not to be placed in those things in which base and earthly flesh revels: but in those through which the soul, which is nobler than the body, attains to be a partaker of heavenly life; and these are, I think, earnest pursuits of virtue, and the brightness of faith and works. If therefore it is not permitted to those willing to live temperately, whether they are endowed with bad or good morals; let those come forward who may convince. But if, although it is placed in our choice to freely accomplish what each wishes; yet all men are free, whether they wish to be strong in spiritual happiness and share heavenly glory equally; nevertheless some, greedy of having more, either excel in riches, or in worldly glory, this ought not to lead us to impious and remote opinions from true knowledge, so that we think the yoke of Fate and Fortune imposed on human affairs. But let him accuse, if it pleases anyone, the greed of the rich, who, what is common to all, if the reasoning of greed were absent, arrogate to themselves as their own. Let him rather seek the will of the Creator, who, when He wishes human affairs to be administered and regarded with equitable order, commands the rich indeed to disperse collected wealth and distribute it for the uses of the poor, but does not permit them to love glory and excellence. That equality is prescribed by God for men who live on earth, it is not difficult to perceive even from the very constitution of the body. For nature does not recognize poor and rich, not ignoble and famous, noble and low, and adorned with the glory of this world; but it proceeds through all without respect of persons, and completes each with the same members for the full perfection of figure and beauty: the way of birth is one for all, the departure from life is one; it does not free one from snares, hold another entangled: but it brings the hard and inevitable necessity of end to all things created. Is it not therefore, I ask you, still obscure, or is it manifest to anyone, that it is the purpose of the divine will that men who live on earth live equally? But hear further the same one, if it seems good, speaking through a certain prophet: “Has not one God created us? Is there not one Father of us all? Why then has each forsaken his brother?”<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup> If therefore some violate the decrees of the Creator, because they are borne by voluntary nods to all things which they wish to do (for the Creator made nature free, and honored it), that indeed is nothing to the purpose; since indeed some also despise human laws. But nevertheless the authors of laws, unless I am mistaken, no sane man would blame: let him rather accuse, and indeed with the best right, those who prefer to despise what is necessary for our utility. When therefore some sin and say, Thus it seemed good to Fortune; and, My Fate looked to this, what delirium is this? I appeal to you. For thus certainly it will be said by us: Why do you accuse what is nowhere? And do you not rather condemn your own levity? But divine Scripture pronounces the truth against those who have not wished to walk rightly: “The folly of a man spoils his ways, but he blames God in his heart.”<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup> Therefore they have strayed from the true opinion, who set Birth and Fate, and most fickle Fortune over our affairs, and did not think that the governance of things ought rather to be attributed to God; although Christ says: “Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them falls to the ground without your Father, who is in heaven. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.”<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup> The Creator provides indeed for all mortals; but yet He permits each to do what seems good to him, and to enter whatever way he wishes. But after the human race became perverse, He immediately gave the law as a help, as it is written. It is therefore dangerous for all who have received the faith of Christ, and have abandoned that old error, to be led by foolish fables to what is not fitting, and to be turned away from sound opinion, so that they think this universe, or certainly man, is ruled by Fortune and fate, which are absolutely nothing.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Most dangerous indeed. For he who is of such a sort will altogether stir up the judge against himself.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Now will you not say that it is most disgraceful, and near and neighboring to such evils, that other thing, namely to observe days and hours and times and years, and the increase and decrease of the lunar globe?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And indeed most greatly: for to those who were called from the Gentiles to salvation, the blessed Paul most openly objects this as a crime, when he says: “But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods. But now, knowing God, or rather being known by God, how do you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire to be enslaved anew? You observe days and months and seasons and years. I am afraid for you, lest perhaps I have labored for you in vain.”<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The observation therefore of hours and days, and moreover of times, is wholly alien to those who do not ignore the one and natural God, but rather, who are known by Him through faith, and called to the union of His grace; for he who wishes to do this turns back, and casts away that glory in Christ, and does not keep his soul as still a lover of liberty, but foolishly rather undergoes the yoke of the old error, when he pays to the foolish world the honor that is proper to God; and adorns with the highest ornaments of glory those things which are borne by the nod of the Creator to their end. Moreover the Apostle calls the elements of the world those quasi-particles of the universe, namely times and months and the measures of these, which occur through hours and days. For because time was continuous, and flowing perpetually carried forward into further duration, God subjected it to measures and numbers by the quasi-interruptions and revolutions of times and hours and days. For it was indeed necessary that those things which do not exist so as to lack beginning, and which are about to come soon to the end of life, should have time also of such a sort that it would both begin and end, and accommodate nature in a way to those things which are not always. Since therefore nothing else is brought in for mortals through times and hours and days, except that revolution in a circle and accurate measurement, what is it that some fabulously imagine, which it is ridiculous even to think, and say that some hours are beneficial, others not, and observe them most diligently, and attribute to them that they can bring either fortunate or unfortunate success to those men whom they wish, or whom it is necessary for them to happen upon? Are not these already deliriums, and the greatest madness, and a certain diabolical snare cunningly prepared?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I confess; and that is indeed evident.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For as a little while ago we said, we are persuaded by them to ascribe our affairs to Fates and Fortune and foreign judgments; when they pronounce our diligence vain, and lead away from care to be undertaken for ourselves; so also in this part, constructing the same error for us, they say that the chances of days and hours hang over mortals as by a necessary yoke, which it is very difficult to avoid: and what is wonderful (for such a fable is foolish) although they see innumerable frustrations accompany such trifles, yet they do not allow by experience that their invention can be refuted, but by accusing the hours and times of malignancy, and passing the same judgment on the decreases which the lunar globe undergoes, they will be able to say anything at all. If therefore anyone wishes to count on the same hour, and perhaps the same day, some rejoicing with prosperous success, others oppressed with the greatest calamities, and say, but what is by its own nature malign, to anyone such it is necessary to be, as it is innate for it to be; if therefore hours and dawns are harmful to men, why do their inconveniences not come equally to all, but some are made masters of most desired things, others sometimes ruined, and heaped with the greatest evils, have become the fable of the crowd and the argument of tragic scene? But whoever wishes diligently both to know what is especially expedient, and also to labor in it, to them it is permitted to see on the same day and perhaps hour one indeed convicted of adultery or murder, paying severe penalties to judges; another enjoying praises of temperance and honesty and the highest probity. But neither did the day or hour prohibit that intemperate one from living temperately; nor again did it impel the good and modest man to petulance and intemperate pleasures, but rather free judgment in all things, and the relaxed and loose nod of the will, caused the one to be engaged in those things, the other to be in these. Therefore it is in us, not placed in the natural qualities of times, to pass life both with joy and otherwise.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> So it seems. For you have used right speech.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But they especially dread the fifth and eighth day; and make excuses in sins, but with what cold and foolish reasonings they flow, no man endowed with prudence is ignorant: for the origin of certain furies, and the rising of demons that are more savage than others, penalties also and fines, and some other things besides, the wretched are not ashamed to weave foolishly into these. But if the lunar globe, previously full, now tends to decrease (for thus through the orbit of monthly intervals it is turned back, now decreasing, now increasing, as it seemed good to the Maker), they cease from every work, and also put off journeys to another day, because they think that with that star our affairs also fail, and when it returns to diminution, they think that human things also waste away together. And if it is permissible to say something mocking their folly, they fear what oysters and most unfortunate vegetables must putrefy with. For such bodies perhaps, or even greater and more excellent ones, we allow to perceive the sense of the same affection by the force of nature, for a reason known to the Maker; for inquiry in such things is slippery, and it is better not to inquire curiously; but certainly this will be absent from the human mind, and will be far removed. For, even if that star by chance decreases, a temperate and moderate man will nevertheless remain the same, nor will his soul be diminished together with the brightness of that star, nor will the nature of things themselves, forced by the force of the star, migrate to a worse or better state. For the attainment of all good things almost always follows those who have done excellent things, and on the contrary, rewards most worthy of them accompany the authors of evil deeds. But I wonder why, when the moon is decreasing, and running to the end of the month, the same men are usurers, and indeed desirous of money, and the interest grows, and on the contrary the purses of those taking loans become lighter; they thought that our affairs necessarily decrease together with the star, and are affected somehow at the same time. Do you not affirm that this is full of laughter and folly?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Most greatly indeed.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But to oppose with long disputations opinions so foolish is vain, in my opinion; for they are absurd by themselves, even with no one speaking. Let us proceed now rather to that.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What, I ask?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It seems to me that Satan detests the fifth and eighth day, and that retreat of the moon from its full light, or the time of conjunction, that is, …</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How do you assert this?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Is not that time numbered by us in the fifth place, in which our Savior came?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I understand from that parable of the Gospel. For Christ went out, who hired workers for the vineyard about the first, third, sixth, ninth, and eleventh hour, that is, at the last time, when He Himself appeared and shone upon us.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Most prudently and most rightly you have spoken. What then? Do we not say that He was handed over on the fifth day of the week, and as if reached the beginnings of the whole dispensation, through which salvation is shared for us all, when made man for us, He endured the cross for our salvation?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Most greatly indeed.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> And did He not destroy death, and, having despoiled hell, live again on the eighth day, that is, on the first day of the week?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> That is indeed not at all doubtful.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Moreover the old law commanded that circumcision in the flesh, which was a certain figure of that circumcision in spirit and truth, be done on the eighth day. But that more excellent circumcision of the old, this, I say, in spirit, is participation in the Holy Spirit, and that grace which we had in the beginning; which, when Christ rose from the dead, He restored anew to us, saying: “Receive the Holy Spirit.”<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup> The blessed Paul also said: “Christ our Passover is sacrificed.”<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup> The day of this saving and most desired sacrifice is the fourteenth from the lunar course. Thus also the law openly proclaimed the day of the sacrifice of our Savior, which we say He endured for the life of the world: “On the tenth day of this month, they shall take every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers; according to the number of souls, they shall make a count for the lamb, and it shall be kept until the fourteenth day of the same month, and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.”<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup> You hear that the victim taken from the tenth day was kept by those ancients until the fourteenth day, that you may understand the fifth time, in which made man, He endured that death for us, the moon now decreasing, which was fulfilled for our rule? And that thing was a figure of the mystery, and seems subtly to signify that the tyrannical dominion of the devil might be referred back as slipped away, and gradually undergo weakness and impotence. For he in a way sustains the figure of the moon; for he rules the night, that is, those who are in darkness, and still sleep, and lack the light of divine knowledge. Indeed, the manner of divine Scripture, inspired by God, compares the flock of the erring to night. Hear what the Lord of all says to the Jews, when the city of Jerusalem had turned back to worship idols: “I have compared your mother to night; my people have become like one who has no knowledge.”<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup> For He calls those “night” who do not have the knowledge of that true and natural divinity. Therefore, that enemy of all hates the times and days on which he himself perished, but we were saved. Moreover, whoever hates with him will also be on his side and will share his fate, to be punished perpetually.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, we shall truly place such things among the impious part, and among the idolatry hateful to God, just as we have undoubtedly placed those things which are most vainly said concerning that which is called “generation.”</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> So I would have you hold; that it is not otherwise, as experience itself of things proves. In addition, that also ought to be especially hateful to us: to be devoted to auguries, whisperings, and incantations. For some of the Gentiles have fallen into such lightness of mind that they thought the knowledge of our affairs is also inherent in birds flying through the air. And so they curiously investigate flights to the east and west, to the right and left; and, if a crow is seen to caw somewhere, they lend their ears and accept it as something most true, and return from there, nor do they, wretched ones, blush to attribute the power of prophecy to little birds. And to this sort of thing, an honorable reason is fabricated, as they themselves think; for through them, they say, the gods show. But we say that the gods are not the apostate angels, by whom, if it pleases God, distinguished and admirable prophecies and foreknowledge of future things are brought to us—the clever crow, the swift hawk, and the various doves (to use the words of the Gentile authors themselves) and other birds; surely worthy prophets for such gods, to whose chattering you listen to have things brought to you; you are also happy and blessed, who have obtained such interpreters of the gods. But you have forgotten, as the matter shows, although you are accustomed to admire the opinions of your poets, that these also seemed ridiculous to them, and considered them nonsense and a completely useless thing. For Homer says:</p>

        <blockquote>
            Come now, you sluggards, he says,<br>
            Whether these are borne to the right, towards the rising sun,<br>
            Or rather to the left, towards the dark realms of the west.
        </blockquote>

        <p class="paragraph">And Euripides decides that it is a foolish thing to observe the flights of birds; for he says that Theseus, inflamed with rage against Hippolytus his son, and planning to drive him from his native land, when he (Hippolytus) said:<br>
        “I do not swear, nor do I believe the oaths of the wise; nor do the sayings of birds, the signs of the sky, drive me out,”<br>
        Theseus replied to this:<br>
        “O that tablet itself, needing no lot, accuses, this convicts; but those which fly above the head I command to be valid.”</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But certainly the voice of God is a suitable authority, and its faith is more certain than little books, at least it is not alien to us to lie; but to sin not at all is proper to God, and truth is most known to Him. But Theseus evidently knew that the birds flying above the head are absolutely nothing. Therefore, the knowledge of future things is not to be ascribed to demons in any way, but we shall rather attribute it to God as something special; and henceforth the predictions of birds were nonsense, and the faith placed in this thing is a clear indication of a mind not sufficiently firm. The Law itself also says: “You shall not practice augury,”<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup> knowing that this thing is execrable and especially hateful to God, the Lord of all.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It seems to me also that these things are so.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Again, incantation and that secret and old-womanish whispering seem to be a part and species of the magical art. And so also the blessed Moses, who declared the heavenly laws to us, always joined these sins, and as kindred and similar crimes, listed incantation together with sorceries. For he says: “There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or a diviner, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.”<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup> Moreover, although incantation is most base and most vicious, yet I know not by what means some admire it, and say that the Lord of Sabaoth is invoked when they chant over the infirm, who exercise such arts. By this reasoning they try to confirm that this pursuit is free from baseness; but they seem to be led into this error and madness by a certain cold and weak reasoning. For this very thing is most troublesome in this matter; for we call God, the Lord of Sabaoth, by this word when we wish to glorify Him, nor do we permit this appellation to any of all things that exist. For one and alone is the Lord of hosts. But they easily cast down this admirable and glorious appellation or glorification to the demons playing along with them, to whomever they wish, and bestow upon the actors of their portents the glory which especially befits God alone, flattering and in turn being captivated by flattery, and for the outcome of things which they desire, they repay this so great magnitude of impiety as a reward. For the cohort of demons is always hostile to God and most desirous of glory. Therefore, it must not be allowed that we be led astray by their perverse counsels; but rather we must depart from them as far as possible; nor listen to evil physicians and authors of portents, the demons, demanding of us these nefarious praises as a kind of reward for their mockeries upon us. But you, if any part of your body pains you, and you truly believe that these words, “Lord Sabaoth,” and other such appellations which divine Scripture attributes to God who is by nature, have the power of driving away that evil, pouring out prayers for yourself, announce these words; for thus you will do more truly than they, and you will attribute glory to God, not to impure spirits. I will also recall the divinely inspired Scripture which says: “Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.”<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, auguries and incantations of charms shall be numbered, if it pleases, among those things which are condemned by law, and which are judged by God most base and most execrable.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Most certainly. I would also add that men can be injurious to God in other ways, and each will be guilty of impiety towards Him and will pay penalties if he is perjured, or has spoken some blasphemous and absurd word concerning that supreme and most excellent glory. For the former is avenged with the highest anger and most grave penalty, the sickle, as it is written, consuming the house of the perjurer and utterly overthrowing it: “For I will come near to you for judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those who oppress the wage earner in his wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, says the Lord of hosts.”<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup> But the latter is punished with death and the ultimate penalty. Therefore, one must not swear falsely; indeed, one must not swear at all; for the Savior taught us this when He said: “But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ For whatever is more than these is from the evil one.”<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup> For those who are considered grave and have made virtue as their companion will have no use of swearing at all; for the life of such men is held in great price among lovers of piety, nor is faith not usually given to them; and, if such a man perhaps says something, it is immediately accepted with the faith of the listeners. Therefore, let the course of our life be excellent, and there will certainly be, as I judge, no use of swearing. But if there is need sometimes, because some occasionally hold in small account the honor which ought to be shown to holy men, let God be called as witness to an oath, nor let the name of any other things be brought forward. For some now proceed inconsiderately to futile vanities, and pretend that it matters not when they swear by heaven, by justice, by Adrasteia, by light, by the lamp. Moreover, gathering certain other things at their own will, they perhaps also think they act piously when they reject the name of God, and adore with the glory which befits God those things which were called into being by His nod. We will find that Israel sometimes labored under some error of this kind. For that temple which was in Jerusalem was undoubtedly built in honor of God, and when they were elated because of this matter and believed that they had obtained all things and had received distinguished glory, they were convicted of having labored little with care concerning those things which had been commanded to them by the most wise man Moses; but God taught them that this would not be glory for them, nor that He delighted in buildings of stones, when He said: “Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool. What house will you build for me? Or what is the place of my rest? says the Lord.”<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup> For God fills all things, and indeed rests in heaven; but He also touches the earth: for the nature of God is not confined by mass, but, as He is far removed from corporeal form, so also is He remote from place and the notion of mass. But the Jews, when they heard Him say, “Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool,” turned to slippery opinions, and assumed heaven for swearing, calling it that divine throne, and similarly earth, as subject to God’s feet; moreover Jerusalem, for it is, they said, the city of the Lord God of all, although those holy earlier ones had used those words, “As the Lord lives,” for the purpose of swearing. But the Lord disapproved of the most foolish thought of the Jews, saying that one must not swear, neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King;<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup> for the things which they said foolishly, the Savior opportunely declared, wishing everywhere to argue against the fabricated and I-know-not-whence-invented religion in such matters. Therefore, let error be absent even in such a matter. For we have learned where one must swear, never to mention anything else, but rather to make a firm and certain faith with those words, “Yes, yes,” “No, no.” The Law also said: “If a man delivers to his neighbor money or goods to keep, and it is stolen out of the man’s house, if the thief is found, he shall pay double. If the thief is not found, then the master of the house shall be brought to the judges to see whether he has put his hand into his neighbor’s goods. For any kind of trespass, whether it concerns an ox, a donkey, a sheep, or clothing, or for any kind of lost thing which another claims to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whomever the judges condemn shall pay double to his neighbor.”<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup> And indeed men swear by something greater (as Paul, that wise man, says), and we rightly say that something is greater than man, not that which is perhaps surpassed in magnitude, or certainly in wisdom and prudence and glory, but that which is such in its whole essence.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I understand little of what you say.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But, Palladius, the discourse is, as it seems to me, clear and evident. For do we not say that many things which have been created far surpass human bodies in magnitude, and among these heaven?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> And indeed greatly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But in prudence and wisdom, and subtlety of bodies, do not angels excel?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> They excel, even in honor.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But besides, in splendor and glory pertaining to the body, is not the sun, by nature, more excellent than mortal parts?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I confess.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It follows, therefore, that each of these, if compared with us from the aspect in which they are superior by birth, justly have excellence; shall we then assume these for the use of swearing, and reject the mention of God as superfluous?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> By no means.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, it follows that we say that which is superior by nature and precedes created things in the reckoning of its whole essence, that is, God, is also greater than man.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, let these words, “Yes,” and “No,” have the place and force of an oath among those who have established the best course of life, and let them be rightly confirmed: for thus it will follow that faith is had in them. But if this form of speech, “Yes,” and “No,” is despised by anyone, then finally let the use of swearing be referred to that which is greater than us, indeed greater than the whole creation. For concerning blasphemy, what need is there to say in what it consists and to what destruction it leads those who are accustomed to use it? which the Law decreed should be punished with a bitter death, and Christ Himself condemned to inevitable and eternal punishments: “Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come.”<sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup> Calling the Spirit that nature superior to body, which is God, into whom if anyone dares to let loose an unbridled tongue, he will reap the fruit of intemperate speech. “For the lips of a fool bring him into trouble, and his mouth calls for blows. A fool’s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.”<sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup> Therefore, also that divine singer of Psalms said: “Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips. Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men who work iniquity.”<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup> And these words are, I think, impious against God and that ineffable and incorrupt nature.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is necessary, therefore, that those who strive to proceed on the right path without any fault or stain, be well confirmed and of such a sort that they in no way endure to offend God.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> I think so. For against those who approach God not with a sound heart, but with one doubting and corrupt, which by its own nature is weak and easily driven to ruin, the prophet speaks: “How long will you limp between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.”<sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup> For to be not wholly sound in faith, nor again fixed in error, is to limp on both sides; and this corrupts sincerity in both matters. Moreover, I think the occasion of this so infirm and fragile mind in some is that they love God not with true but feigned love, and indeed pretend to wish to be Christians; yet they do not do this with their whole heart, nor are they led to that opinion by reverence for truth, or hold what is right in high regard; but that they may hunt their own pleasure or fear of danger, or the terrible onset of some severe misfortune, as if enchanting by some incantation those whom they seem to have approached, they may have many to strive along with them, and lend their own care. But the ultimate provision will be given to such men, and their lot will be among the most abject men, and they will be found most ignominious and contemptible, and they will scarcely be able to attain to be deemed worthy of life itself, God examining the things hidden in us: such as were the Gibeonites. For they once approached Joshua and entreated exceedingly to be allied with the people of God; yet they did not make their approach without guile, nor indeed simple and without trafficking, and as if from love towards God, but in hypocrisy and deceit. And they remained hidden at first, but when they were caught doing bitter things, and were discovered to be malignant and crafty, they were placed among the lowest. For they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for the whole assembly.<sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup> You see therefore to what end dissimulation leads, and the unwillingness to embrace from a sound mind the spiritual kinship and affinity with the saints. For sometimes some deceive—I do not say Christ, who knows all things—but those who rather hold His type, that is, the leaders of the people, as indeed those men at that time deceived Joshua, who is brought forward in Scripture as a figure and image of Christ; and they enter with deceit concealed, in the depth of thoughts, and presenting hypocrisy as a cover for the malice in their mind; but being convicted (for it is not possible to hide), they will scarcely be saved, having the servile and lowest portion; for deceit is the fruit of a mind not free. But we, for whom it is of concern to think soundly the things of God, and who neglect the rest, will cling to our Lord and God of all, with a simple heart, right mind, entire love, which does not allow us to labor under the vice of a double mind, but is wholly alien from Gentile morals and sentiments, and goes as far away as possible and very quickly from those things condemned by the Law. For thus we will be perfect before the Lord our God, according to what is written, and shining and well-pleasing with the other saints in Christ, through whom and with whom to the Father be glory with the Holy Spirit forever and ever. Amen.</p>
