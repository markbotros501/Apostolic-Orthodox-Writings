    <h1>On Adoration and Worship in Spirit and Truth, Book VII</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">Concerning Love of Brother</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The law adorns that first and supreme commandment with the highest praises, to which nothing can be added, namely: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> And it adds besides: "And your neighbor as yourself."<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Since Christ Himself also says plainly that on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets, and the blessed Paul calls love the fullness of the law<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> because it does no evil to a neighbor, it seems that our previous discussion, as the subject allowed, has sufficiently explained that first commandment, having examined everything up and down and, as it were, all around in a circle, and having taught not obscurely how perfect love for God, free from all blame, can be shown by us. Come then, let us investigate this neighboring and related commandment, and carefully consider love of neighbor, and diligently examine those things through which one can arrive at that excellent virtue; and, by the diligence applied to this matter, having attained the highest glory, he may walk in goodness with God and men, like that divine Samuel.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> For I think that along with that love towards God, the other love towards brothers is appropriately to be exercised. For he who lacks one, necessarily lacks both, according to the voice of John; for he wrote thus: "If anyone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should love his brother also."<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> Therefore, each dies with the other and rises splendidly together; for the virtues are, as it were, neighbors to each other, and like indivisible yoke-mates, they bring him who has studied best to govern this chariot to a certain one distinguished and most perfect beauty of piety towards God.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Rightly said. And since the plan of the proposed discussion demands that labor be undertaken in explaining these things, proceed now again, and gather proofs from the sacred Scriptures for each of the matters you have proposed for contemplation; and strive to explain to me how the absolute perfection of love towards neighbor can come about.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> A very broad path leads us to this. For it is written: "Your commandment is exceedingly broad."<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> But the skill and diligence in performing each action, I think, cannot be gathered from elsewhere except through the law, which the prophetic word testifies was given to us as a help.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> And indeed, that the lawgiver might rouse us to the perpetual remembrance of the precepts, he says: "And you shall lay up these words in your heart and in your soul, and you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. And you shall teach them to your children, talking of them when you are sitting in your house, and when you are walking by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land that the Lord swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth."<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> And what it is to "bind them on your hands," he explained clearly in Numbers. For it is written thus: "And the Lord said to Moses, 'Say to the people of Israel, that they make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and put a cord of blue on the tassel of each corner. And it shall be a tassel for you to look upon and remember all the commandments of the Lord, to do them, not to follow after your own heart and your own eyes, which you are inclined to whore after. So you shall remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God.'"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> Therefore, having first commanded us to write the law in our hearts, and knowing besides that forgetfulness is a grave disease of the mind, he ordered the commandments to be inscribed on the doorposts as if on a tablet; and moreover, to bind to the right hand, perhaps certain small tablets as it were giving birth to the law, having the divine response inscribed; and besides, he said it is not useless to have hanging from the very garments both the tassels and the blue cord.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> How can we be reminded of the divine law through tassels and a blue cord?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Do you not admit that the law was given to the ancients in enigmas and, as it were, in shadows?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I admit it.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, to bind tassels and a blue cord to the hand signifies figuratively and through an enigma that heavenly things are to be both understood and done, and those lofty laws are to be retained in memory? For the ethereal body is, unless I am mistaken, somewhat similar to the Indian stone, I mean the hyacinth, mixed with brightness and darkness, and having in its depth something watery, showing a trembling and fluid appearance. The law, therefore, wisely commanded that the blue cord be attached to their garments and also to the hand, somehow hinting, as it were, that the garment of the mind and the covering of thought, the word from heaven, is the law, and also the judge of right actions. For the hand is a symbol of work; and the things that are done lawfully by us are altogether blameless and have nothing sinister in baseness. Therefore the Pharisees made their tassels long and enlarged their phylacteries, that is, the tablets hanging from the right hand; yet they were laughed at by Christ because they had turned the matter to an occasion of vainglory, not to the remembrance of the law. It is possible, therefore, that although what the law commands is done, yet the law itself is violated, unless one uses the law rightly. And this, I think, is what Solomon says: "There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness."<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> Therefore, the divine commandment must be inscribed in the mind and in the heart; and making the utility of this matter clear, that divine David, speaking of every righteous man, said: "The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not slip."<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> For that, I think, is plainly manifest: on whomever the divine law is in the mind, to him also belongs, besides, to be well-established and to stand firm in virtue.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> So it is.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, constant and perpetual meditation on the law leads to the right way, which is the same as to what is pleasing to God, dispelling forgetfulness from the human mind like some darkness and gloom. Nor indeed did the lawgiver progress only this far; but having thought of something still better, to excite alacrity in undertaking labors, he joins hope of all most desirable things as a kind of bait. For he says again: "If you walk in my statutes and observe my commandments and do them, then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. Your threshing shall last to the time of the vintage, and the vintage shall last to the time for sowing; and you shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land securely. And I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; and I will remove harmful beasts from the land, and the sword shall not go through your land."<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> Do you understand with what care and kindness He deigns to regard the upright man, dedicated to good works, and who reveres the law? For He promises to give timely and late rain, and an abundance of fruits succeeding one another, and fullness of bread, and a rich yield of foods; besides, He promises peace. For it is fitting that the true worshiper of the law, and the most eager lover of things pleasing to God, be filled with an abundance of heavenly goods. For that spiritual and heavenly consolation, irrigating the soul of the righteous man like fertile and rich soil with showers, greatly gladdens him, so that he can produce constant and, as it were, manifold fruits of piety towards God. And peace crowns him, granting that he may be able to remain in that which is good. Therefore Paul writes: "And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds..."<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> Whoever, therefore, obtains such liberality from God will lead a life free from wars and full of peace; the enemy will yield and fall, and whatever resists will come to nothing, and the diabolical assault will be in vain, and every fear will be easily driven away. We will find this same law described also in Deuteronomy; for thus he said, with a few changes: "But if you will indeed obey all my commandments that I command you today, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, he will give the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the later rain, and you shall gather in your grain, your wine and your oil, and you shall give fodder to your livestock in your fields."<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> Therefore, meditation on the law will provide our souls with the power and fitness to carry out properly the things that God wills; moreover, the love of promised goods will make the sweat undertaken for virtue tolerable.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is so; for I assent, and rightly so. But now it is time to explain by what reasoning one can fulfill the law about loving one's neighbor.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, we must approach this very discussion. So we say, following the traces of the sacred Scriptures, that God, the Lord of all, commanded Moses to assemble the people and lead them pure and sanctified under the mountain named Sinai. For He commanded them to wash their garments and to abstain from intercourse with women for three days. In this, through the things that were exposed to the senses and done visibly, He signified spiritual things: for those who come into the presence of God ought to be adorned, as it were, with splendid garments, that is, with the ornaments of virtues, and distinguished by cheerfulness of soul, and alien from every carnal pleasure and earthly defilement; the law instructing us to this, as Moses indeed instructed those ancients. For those things were figures of true things. And that instruction through the most wise Moses prefigured to the ancients the discipline of the law leading to Christ. Besides this, it is also worthy of note that the office and person of him who ought to instruct is excellently preserved in the person of Moses. For he did not bring the people to himself, but to God as to the lawgiver and teacher, and the author of things to be done. The law also, which instructed through the letter, did not bring us to itself, but to God the Word, who descended from heaven for us. Does our discourse seem to you to follow the traces of true understandings?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Very much so.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is written, therefore: "And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the Lord had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly. And the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder. Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder."<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> Therefore, that God descended on the mountain can be a clear sign that He does not come to the most abject minds; nor is He accustomed to dwell with those who have earthly and lowly cast-down souls; but with him whose soul ascends on high and, as it were, holding a lofty summit, despises human things and looks only at the things that are God's. It can also have another meaning, namely that the knowledge of God is sublime and superior to our condition, and can be perceived only by those who have striven to fly through lofty things, and indeed only in part. "For the young vultures fly high,"<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> as it is written. At the same time understand that God, when giving the old law to those ancient men, descended not where the people were, but to a lofty place, and indeed far off. For He had withdrawn far off, according to the voice of the Psalmist,<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> since the Only-Begotten had not yet approached us through the flesh, nor had He emptied Himself to that humiliation. For this mystery was reserved not for those ancients, but for us ourselves. For He became among us, as far as concerns that visible glory, having left the sublimity of divinity, and lived with us as one of us. God descended in the form of fire: for it was indeed fitting that those who were to be ruled by compulsion and law should know for certain that if they wished to decline to idleness, they would have to give an account to fire. For the love of God was not maintained by those ancient men from voluntary love and spontaneous movements of the soul, but as if from compulsion and fear. For they did not have a free spirit, nor of adoption, but of servitude in fear. Moreover, the mountain smoked because the Lord had descended on it in fire: and that, I think, is what is sung in the Psalms: "And he made darkness his covering."<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> Smoke can also signify to us in another way those tears that are to be poured out wholly on account of contempt. For at the approach of smoke, that moisture flows from the eyes. But if anyone wishes to apply to the proposed contemplations otherwise, he will reckon the fire as the illumination through the law, yet not without dimness. For the law is dim and obscure, and that shadow from the letter is thick, and can cast darkness upon the eye of the mind. And the voices of the trumpet were gradually increasing. For at first, when the law emitted a faint and scarcely audible voice, when the Word proceeded to us, and that Emmanuel shone forth to deliver the evangelical discipline, the voices became stronger. For Christ sounded forth something clear and sharp, and which has already penetrated the whole world. For He Himself can be heard speaking through the voice of David: "Hear this, all peoples; give ear, all inhabitants of the world."<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> And yet the voice of the law at that time was not heard elsewhere, nor did it teach all nations, but resounded in the region of the Jews alone, and instructed the one nation of Israel. But "Moses spoke," it says, "and God answered him with a voice."<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> For Moses, as a servant and mediator and minister of the divine decrees, sought the law; but God answered with His own voice, that is, through the Son. For the voice and word of the Father is the Son. And from Him the law is, even though it was spoken through angels. At any rate, if one wishes, he can hear Him saying clearly: "I, the one speaking, am here."<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> And: "I have not come to abolish the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away."<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> Therefore, He calls the law His own words; for the voice of God uttered it, as I just said, that is, the Son. Then He says: "And the Lord came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. And the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up. And the Lord said to Moses, 'Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the Lord to look and many of them perish. And also let the priests who come near to the Lord consecrate themselves, lest the Lord break out against them.'"<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> God, who is over all, descends on the mountain; then Moses, called, ascends. For it is not possible for anyone to rise to the heights of true contemplation of God unless God Himself descends and prepares to become accessible to our minds; and with Him calling, we scarcely ascend to that lofty and elevated summit, as it were, the true knowledge of Him, which Christ did, revealing to us the Father and God. And the mountain cannot be approached by ordinary men; for the grace of that supreme knowledge is inaccessible to the multitude, and open only to those who know how to enter it, indeed to those who are called by God to this, as Moses undoubtedly was. If, therefore, anyone is a faithful and true servant in the house of God, he too, like him, is chosen and suitable to approach near to God, as pertains to the manner of sanctification and knowledge. For by this reasoning we shall be with Him, as He says: "But you, stand here by me."<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> He also commands those who are distinguished by the priesthood to be purified, saying: "Lest the Lord break out against them."<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup> For the priestly office is slippery and not far from dangers, indeed even near, unless perfect integrity of life is present. For it is fitting that those who offer worship to the all-holy God be holy. Then He says: "And the Lord said to Moses, 'Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you; but do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the Lord, lest he break out against them.'"<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup> Moses ascends, but not without Aaron, who held the figure of Christ. For the law is honorable in Christ, and through Him is, as it were, holy near God and with God. For it also proclaims that chief priest and apostle of our confession according to the Scriptures.<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup> Let the law, therefore, be joined to Christ through spiritual contemplation. For it was said to Moses: "Ascend, you and Aaron." — "What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate,"<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> separating the law from that contemplation which is in Christ, while he hardens the shadow and does not admit the truth to the image of the figures. But that sacred race is forbidden to ascend the mountain together with the people; for it is not given by God to those who are ruled by the law, nor to those who still offer that worship in shadows, to approach those exalted and supreme doctrines which pertain to the knowledge of Him; but this is rather reserved for those who, justified by faith, and in Christ, are called to an obedience and knowledge far surpassing that old one. For the eminent knowledge of Christ the blessed Paul also admired; and the Savior Himself is a witness to this, who says plainly both about us and about those who are of the race of Israel: "To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given."<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup> Concerning the Jews indeed: "Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind."<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup> But to those who knew Him, He said again: "Blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear."<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup> When He had finished speaking of these things, the God of all begins to command and to establish laws concerning the best things. And thus He says: "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. You shall have no other gods before me."<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> He fittingly made the beginning of His laws by saying that He is the one who was the author of those wonders in Egypt; who, against the madness of unjust masters, roused all creation, to speak in one word; who showed rains and hail, and changes of the elements; who sent a miserable death upon the firstborn; who poured out three days of darkness upon them; who granted to go through the midst of the waters as He willed; who crushed the adversaries with no trouble. For it was indeed necessary that those who were to bear the yoke of the divine precepts should not be ignorant of how great the power of the lawgiver was, and should know that it was by no means safe for them to offend Him who could easily accomplish all things.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> A truly excellent and most worthy plan of the lawgiver. For fear almost always drives to obedience, and renders a man, however unbridled and difficult, obedient to the bit, like a horse.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Most rightly said. When, therefore, He had forbidden the worship of other gods and the making of any idol or image or picture, and had established the extreme penalty if anyone dared to ascribe the name of divinity to the makers of false likenesses: "For you shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain,"<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup> then He turns to composing human affairs, and prescribes for the life of all men the law as a certain rule by which what is right is sought; and He restrains us from all sins, while beforehand He designates the time of that in Christ, in which that most perfect redemption and abolition of vices, and reformation to the former state, and renewal of life which is led in holiness and love of God, occurred. Therefore He says: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But what is that? For I do not sufficiently understand. And how shall we sanctify the Sabbath day?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Shall we speak a little about the Sabbath and about the cessation that was observed on it? For thus the things divinely commanded to us will be most clear.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Certainly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The Sabbath, Palladius, designates the last days of the week, I think, the time in which our Savior came, who appeared indeed at the consummation, and nearly at the very end of the present age; but He has become for us the beginning and door and way to the washing away of sins, to freedom and remission, to incorruption and life, and finally to the future hope. In many ways the faith of the sacred Scriptures also hints to us at this Sabbath rest understood in Christ, sometimes describing the cessation, as it were, from sins, and determining a very bitter and harsh punishment for the transgressor; at other times figuratively showing the redemption and remission that is in Him, and the preparation for the future age.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Explain, therefore, how. For I would most gladly learn it.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Through faith, Palladius, which is understood in Christ, we celebrate the Sabbath spiritually, ceasing from the distractions of this world, and resting from vain error, and departing from wickedness, and shaking off the yoke of sin, we are relaxed for free sanctification. And so the blessed Paul says concerning those who had not yet believed: "And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient? And we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief. Let us therefore fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach the promise of entering his rest."<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> And after other things: "So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God."<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> And see how it is not true, if the Sabbath rest is only to be idle on the Sabbath, how did Israel not enter the rest, although they observed that idleness on the Sabbath? But surely that matter was a type of that rest in Christ, and that those justified by faith would cease from sin. Therefore God commanded that he who gathered wood on the Sabbath be stoned; that punishment was a figure of a spiritual and necessary thing. For is not the wood that has withered from its own root, plucked and already dry, a symbol of mortality? And it can also be fuel for fire.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is so.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Such is sin, full of all evils, like a kind of mortality, and the impious nurse of the fierce flame for those who love it. Whenever, therefore, at the time of cessation from sins, I mean, some are intent on dead and unfruitful works, and choose to love, having cast away virtue, those things through which punishments and flames are kindled for them forever, they will undergo the sentence of death deservedly, since although it is possible to live at ease, they willingly hasten to be punished. Therefore, we who have believed enter into the rest, according to the voice of the blessed Paul.<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> And so through Jeremiah God rebukes those who, through sin, were adulterating the beauty of truth for the type; He says thus: "Go and stand in the gates of the sons of your people, by which the kings of Judah enter and go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem; and you shall say to them: Hear the word of the Lord, kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all Jerusalem, who enter through these gates. Thus says the Lord: Guard your souls, and do not carry burdens on the day of the Sabbaths, and do no work, and do not go out through the gates of Jerusalem, and do not carry burdens out of your houses on the day of the Sabbaths, and do no work: sanctify the day of the Sabbaths, as I commanded your fathers; and they did not listen, nor incline their ear, but stiffened their neck more than their fathers, so as not to hear me, nor to receive discipline... Therefore, he commanded not only that they should cease from all work on the Sabbath, but also that they should not carry burdens out, nor go out through the gates of Jerusalem.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But what reason can be given for these things as well?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> A spiritual and sublime one indeed, and more excellent than those figures and shadows for the ancients. For he commands those who celebrate the Sabbath in Christ to cease from work that tends to vice and sin, and forbids placing any burden on the shoulders: for how is it not the height of insanity for those who once through faith have plainly cast off the very heavy burden of sin, to impose the same on themselves again, and willingly subject themselves once more to the yoke of wickedness? But to sit within the gates of Jerusalem signifies that we must not depart from the holy city, nor allow ourselves, while turning aside to something else, to be carried outside and slip away. Understand the holy city as the Church: for already some who had become illustrious through faith in Christ, and were burdened with the nefarious load of sin, and had entered within the gates of the holy house of God, were led to defection and apostasy, even if not open perhaps, yet certainly they leaped out from the holy gate, because they esteemed the morals of men devoted to idols. Therefore, God commanded those spiritually observing the Sabbath to sit within the gates: by which figure he signifies firmness and constancy, and that we must never depart from His sincere and genuine worship. Moreover, that the Church of God is a city, David most openly testifies, when he says of it: "Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God."<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup> The Savior Himself also gives most certain assurance concerning it, saying: "Here I will dwell, for I have chosen it."<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is concluded, therefore, that one must desist from all work on the Sabbath, as the lawgiver certainly intended.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Not from all absolutely, I say, Palladius; for from thinking and doing those things which please God, and which have no small utility, one can never laudably cease. Nor indeed (as it seems to me) did the sacred Scriptures in vain add that we must sanctify the day of the Sabbaths: "For remember," He says, "the day of the Sabbaths, to sanctify it."<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup> We will accomplish this best if, celebrating the Sabbath spiritually, we devote care and diligence to holy works. An evident figure of this was that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violated the Sabbath, and without blame attended to sacred things, sacrificed victims, slaughtered sheep,<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup> and finally did all things pertaining to the glory of God, with no one forbidding them. For what? Did not Christ Himself oppose this to the calumnies of the Jews, when they accused Him of violating the Sabbath, because He healed the paralytic on the Sabbath?<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I remember.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> A man is also circumcised on the Sabbath, according to the Savior's word, the law not punishing it.<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup> Surely this promises and almost openly testifies that for those who keep the Sabbath in Christ, that is, who cease from sin and are sanctified through faith, that spiritual circumcision most clearly applies, which takes place on the eighth day, that is, the day of resurrection: for so Christ rose; who after He revived, destroyed the power of death, and sealed His disciples with the Holy Spirit: and this is that circumcision in the Spirit. For He breathed on them, saying: "Receive the Holy Spirit."<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup> Does not Paul also confess that circumcision is thus made in the spirit?<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup> For he asserted that those who believed ought to be circumcised with a circumcision not made by hands, that is, by the spirit. Moreover, I would add that we who observe the Sabbath spiritually cannot ever fittingly cease from labors pertaining to spiritual strength, from tiring contests, and from overcoming adversaries in Christ: and I will bring forth for you again the image of that ancient Joshua, who together with the sons of Israel captured the city of Jericho on the seventh day, that is, on the Sabbath.<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Therefore, the Sabbath, as far as pertains to truth, brings us only a vacation from wicked and sinful works, as if we were idle from them, while still for the ancients it was almost a shadow.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> I say so: but if it is otherwise, it will clearly show the mystery of Christ.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> In what way then?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The law certainly says again: "If you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve you six years, but in the seventh year he shall go out free, for nothing..."<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> And this indeed is in Exodus. But in Deuteronomy it again says thus: "If your brother, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, is sold to you, he shall serve you six years, and in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you. And when you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty-handed; you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress; as the Lord your God has blessed you, you shall give to him..."<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup> For in the whole former time before the advent of our Savior, Israel was bound by the spirit of servitude, subjected to the law; but after Emmanuel shone forth at the end times of the age, of which the Sabbath was also placed by us as a figure, then truly the spirit of servitude was removed; and since they had contributed nothing to the Lord for redemption, they were called to freedom and to the glory of adoption by the grace of God: for they were justified who believed, not by works of the law, as it is written, but by faith.<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup> And this, I say, is that: "He shall go out free for nothing." But He adds, "You shall let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty-handed; you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress." You see clearly the force of the mystery of Christ shining in these words: for we have been redeemed, and the Savior of all let us go free for nothing. For not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His great mercy, as it is written,<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup> we have been made partakers of such excellent kindness. And when He had set us free, that is, freed us from sins, and adorned us with the grace of adoption, He added for us an excellent provision, giving Himself as an immaculate victim, and as a sheep led to slaughter for us, and granted that we might be partakers of the life-giving blessing, that is, of His holy flesh and blood. This is, I think, the provision to be supplied from the sheep, and from the grain and wine to those who in the seventh time, that is, the spiritual Sabbath, are called to freedom by the kindness of the Lord. And the law indeed thus far. But because the Jews, due to their folly, were not much pleased to keep the divine commandment, God accuses them of being of this mind. For it is written: "The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying: Thus says the Lord God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying: At the end of seven years each of you must set free his Hebrew brother who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you shall set him free from you. But they did not listen to me or incline their ear, but turned today to do what is right in my eyes, to proclaim liberty, every one to his neighbor, and they made a covenant before me in the house that is called by my name. But then you turned and profaned my name when every one of you took back his male and female slaves, whom you had set free, to be your slaves once again."<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup> Do you see how He does not allow the figures to be rejected, or rather the very truth, as still in shadows, to be violated? "For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable,"<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup> as it is written. The Jews, however, who were dragging back those once freed, and subjecting them again to the yoke of servitude, did not keep that irrevocability, and for that reason they offended, because they had despised the force of His mystery, although it was still in figures.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Most rightly said.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Moreover, that we are justified freely, by the grace which is in Christ, and bring no exchange or price for our way, nor buy the glory of freedom, but gain such a great thing by the kindness and mercy of the Lord, was prefigured in Deuteronomy, saying: "At the end of every seven years you shall grant a remission. And this is the manner of the remission: every creditor shall release what he has lent to his neighbor. He shall not exact it of his neighbor, his brother, because the Lord's remission has been proclaimed. Of a foreigner you may exact it, but whatever of yours is with your brother your hand shall release. But there will be no poor among you; for the Lord will bless you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you for an inheritance to possess."<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup> Do you see the truth shining among the shadows? For this also can most clearly show the governance of our Savior, by which He rules us. For those who through faith have drawn near to Him, and, having received the Holy Spirit and partnership in the divine nature, have now become members of the household and brothers, to them He has forgiven debts, since they had paid nothing; for He did not require from them the penalties of transgression, although they were bound by the preceding account of life to render them. But those who because of their pernicious unbelief were still strangers, and almost foreigners, and very far removed from union with Him, He established as obligated to pay their debts, and, as one who had not yet wiped away the stain of sin, made them rightly liable to penalties and punishments. And therefore He spoke to those who had believed: "If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup> But to those who despised the true and evangelical discipline, He said: "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you believe that I am he, you will die in your sins."<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup> Do you understand, therefore, how He promises to set free those who are joined to Him by faith, but affirms that strangers and foreigners, dead in trespasses, will pay the penalties of their own sins?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> It is true.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Moreover, it elegantly designates the holy pleasures of the future age, and the participation in the highest goods, by the Sabbaths.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Explain to me, then, in what way; for I desire to learn it.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Most willingly. For indeed the blessed David sings concerning the sons of Israel and God, who can do all things, saying: "He gave them the bread of heaven; man ate the bread of angels."<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup> By these words he called the manna the food of heaven and of angels, so that we, directing our mind beyond sensible and visible things, may contemplate that spiritual and divine sustenance which God supplies to the souls of the saints, since God the Word, who feeds the angels and gives life to men, dwells in those who have received faith. For Christ dwells in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, and we are fed with the living bread that came down from heaven to conceive spiritual firmness and strength: the manna is a certain and evident figure of this. But the law commanded that the sons of Israel should gather from it only as much as was sufficient for each, and should add nothing beyond the measure. For thus it is written: "In the morning, when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as frost on the ground. When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, ‘What is it?’ For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, ‘It is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat. This is what the Lord has commanded: “Gather of it, each one of you, as much as he can eat. You shall each take an omer, according to the number of the persons that each of you has in his tent.”’"<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup> Then after some other things it says again: "On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers each. And when all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses, he said to them, ‘This is what the Lord has said: “Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord; bake what you will bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over lay aside to be kept till the morning.”’"<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup> Then Moses, that interpreter of divine things, explained the law to them, continually adding: "Eat it today, for today is a Sabbath to the Lord; today you will not find it in the field. Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath, there will be none."<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup> Can it be obscure to you henceforth, Palladius, that this very doing nothing on the Sabbath, but storing up what has already been supplied as in a storeroom, and that manna is not given from heaven then, but one uses what has already been gathered for pleasure and food, is as it were a preparation and formation of that life which will be in the age to come? For those who keep the Sabbath in Christ, and completely cease from sin, will enjoy those heavenly goods, when all labor will be removed, and without sweat we will find all things that can help us abundantly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> A true discourse: for the life of the saints then will be led as if in goods prepared and ready at hand. Therefore, let us also be allowed to say to each saint: "You shall eat the labor of your hands."<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, returning to what was set forth at the beginning, and as it were turning back the course of the discourse, we assert that the law, having most fittingly brought us to worship the one who is by nature and truly God, did not allow us to be ignorant of that Word, which is born from Him and in Him, and co-exists and is co-eternal. For when it had first commanded and said: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might,"<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup> and besides: "You shall have no other gods before me,"<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup> it immediately joined the mystery of Christ, adding: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup> For this is an excellent and necessary seed, and the way of divine craftsmanship, and most useful for learners of what must be known. Therefore, the Savior, speaking to the Father who is in heaven and God, says: "And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent."<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup> For where words about the Father occur, words pertaining to the Son necessarily follow, and the knowledge is most closely joined. Indeed, the Jews, because they did not admit the Son, straying from the truth, and boasting that they knew God, He rebuked, saying: "You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would know my Father also."<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup> For in each the knowledge of the other is simultaneously implied. Therefore, when first, like a foundation, it had laid a sure and accurate knowledge of God, and had fixed in us the knowledge of the Lawgiver as if roots had been put down, it finally descends to human affairs, and places next to and joins to the reverence we show to God that which is owed to father and mother, by whose work, with God's approval, we have been brought to the point of existing and subsisting altogether; since they hold the second place after the Creator. For by divine commands, and by an art not handed down from another but perceived spontaneously, nature fashions what is born in itself into life, and imitates the glory of the Creator: for as God is the maker and founder by reason, the beginning and origin of all; so also each parent is, from himself begetting a son, as it were a certain root of procreation, and a source from which he proceeds, that he may exist. Therefore, this provision of father and mother, which they provide for the procreation of all men on earth, bears the figure of that Creator of all: and for this reason the law commanded that a more outstanding honor be given to them than to other men, neither excluding from rewards those who rendered honor to them, nor in turn freeing from punishment those who were unwilling to do so: for it adorns every honest mind with honors, but burdens the one who is otherwise disposed with very grave evils. "For honor your father," it says, "that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth."<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup> Therefore, when the law had established life and length of time as a kind of reward and special gift for those honoring parents, but had set forth death for the proud and injurious, it applies fear as a certain pedagogue, who leads us to the right path by fear. For it says again: "Whoever strikes his father or his mother shall be put to death. Whoever curses his father or his mother shall be put to death."<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup> See, therefore, how it punishes every kind of sin committed against them with an equal measure. It is clear that the precepts concerning God are closely joined to those pertaining to the rights of parents. For just as if any sin is committed with the tongue against God, it is punished with death and extreme penalty, similarly if anything is committed against those who begot them. And certainly whoever makes void a divine commandment, and willingly offends the pedagogue by its violation, is killed without any mercy. Likewise, whoever despises the admonitions of father or mother is stoned to death, since the divine law commanded the same. And it spoke to this manner in Deuteronomy: "If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and, though they discipline him, will not listen to them, then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gate of the place where he lives, and they shall say to the elders of his city, ‘This our son is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.’ Then all the men of the city shall stone him to death with stones. So you shall purge the evil from your midst."<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup> Is it still permissible to doubt that good children are to be born from father and mother?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> By no means doubtful. For that we ought to honor them, that also persuades us which was wisely said by someone: "Remember that you were born through them."<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup> Also the patriarch Jacob, when he says most modestly: "If the fear of my father Isaac had not been with me..."<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Tell me, then, does this very statement that we are said to have been born through them not show clearly enough that they hold the image of the Creator, and of Him who calls into existence things that did not exist? Now, this very fact that we ought to honor them also with our fear, does it not attribute to them also the dignity of the Lord?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Certainly indeed. Therefore, that author of Proverbs curses some, saying: "The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be picked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures."<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup> Yet I would like you to explain how it can be thought to be wisely said by Christ the Savior of all: "Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me."<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup> Moreover, I will mention that also; for to a disciple asking to bury his father and nourish his old age, He said: "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But what is absurd in these? For certainly nothing difficult, as it seems to me, but the understanding of the proposed passages is quite simple, and very easy to grasp for those who wish to understand rightly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But those words are not entirely free from suspicion: for they seem in some way to lead us away from that reverence which is owed to parents.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Far from that suspicion, Palladius, and such perverse understanding: for the words of our Savior do not lead away from reverence toward parents, but teach that the reverence shown to God is older and more excellent. Which also our preceding discourse has accomplished, when we repeatedly said that the love toward parents is next and second to that which is to be held toward God; which certainly Christ Himself also observed, when He neither ascribed it as a crime to those who loved parents, nor altogether blamed or accused those who willingly rendered honor to them, but most fittingly decreed that all human things are to be held after God. Therefore, He did not say absolutely: "Whoever loves his father or mother," but added: "more than me." Will you think that love toward God is not to be preferred to love toward men?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> I indeed judge it ought to be preferred altogether.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, He did not permit the disciple to go into that opinion, so as to think that the reverence owed to a man, even a parent, should be preferred to that other which must be held toward God, who elsewhere by His patronage defends the natural laws about rendering honor to parents. Therefore, He teaches that His things are to be preferred to ours; God excels and stands above all. Nor, because the things pertaining to God are to be thought and said to be older and more excellent, does He nevertheless in any way permit some to count that reverence toward parents as nothing; for Christ charged this as a crime against the teachers of the Jews, when He said: "God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’; but you say, ‘If anyone tells his father or his mother, “Whatever you would have gained from me is given to God,” he need not honor his father.’ So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God."<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> But the understanding of the proposed words is not very easy. Explain, therefore, what the sin of the Pharisees is in this matter.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> In Leviticus it is certainly written: "The Lord spoke to Moses, saying, ‘Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, If anyone makes a special vow to the Lord involving the valuation of persons, then the valuation of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary...’"<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup> And when he had said a few things in between about a woman and about children, he adds again: "But if he is too poor to pay the valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to what the vower can afford, the priest shall value him."<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup> Therefore, these words are mystical and hidden; but at a more opportune place they will be diligently examined by us. Let us say what is at hand and in our grasp. Some of the Israelites used to come, according to the law, confessing their vows for themselves, and consecrate their souls to God, indeed in figure and shadow, yet from the ordinance of the law they desired; and they professed that they would give a price to those who performed the priesthood, and attended to the divine altar, for themselves. There were, therefore, some who sought such glory: for they wished to be called sanctified already and sacred, and a gift dedicated to God, and whatever other such title there is. But they restrained this desire due to lack of money, having poverty as an unavoidable impediment to the matter. But the Scribes and Pharisees, exhorting them and with great zeal urging that they ought to go to this (for such men are very fond of money, and overcome by desire for shameful gain), they put forward reverence toward parents, saying that they could scarcely provide for themselves and for them what was necessary for life, or gather clothing, speaking truly. But these dared to persuade them to consider the matter as nothing for God's sake; and if their parents came to them seeking the customary help from them, they taught that one should say to father and mother: "A gift, whatever you might profit from me." That is, "Whatever you might receive from me, know that you are harming the divine dedication, and laying hands on sacred money, for I have dedicated myself and promised as a gift to God." But they, fearing the harm of sacrilege, and greatly dreading the laws established on this, endured, lamenting, and stretched out the pretext that piety toward God had become for them a cause of hunger, perhaps even crying out against the divine commandment, as unjustly reducing them to utmost need. Why, then, does He say, "You have made void the commandment of God, for the sake of your tradition"? For they ought to honor their parents; not for the sake of piety toward God was the law concerning parents to be destroyed. Therefore, neither must the things proper to God be neglected on account of human affairs, nor indeed must human affairs be entirely neglected on account of God; but rather, when we have allotted the excellence of love to the Beginning of all, that is, to God, then as in a second and neighboring place, we must immediately convey also to the ministers of our birth the honors most fitting to them, bearing in mind what I have said.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> What is that?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> For our Lord Jesus Christ shows us that reverence toward parents is a thing most necessary, when He had care and consideration for His own mother. For when He was already lifted up on the venerable cross, and nailed to the wood, He entrusted the holy Virgin to His genuine disciple, and appointed that beloved one as guardian and nourisher of her old age, saying: "Woman, behold your son"; then to the disciple: "Behold your mother"; and from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> This discourse on this matter seems to us to have been most excellently completed.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> When, therefore, He had most rightly subjected children to parents, and imposed on them the lawful and necessary yoke, He immediately declares what sort of parents also ought to be toward children, if they do not wish to deviate from the will of God. And indeed Paul, that most wise man, after he briefly and expediently commanded children to be subject to parents, added also this: "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup> That is, be authors of the best disciplines for them, and direct them to a life pleasing to God and most in accord with the law. But in a certain roundabout way (for thus He is accustomed to speak), He commands parents, first and most rightly, to be solicitous for the probity of their children: "Do not profane your daughter by making her a prostitute, lest the land fall into prostitution and the land become full of depravity."<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup> For our Creator demands chastity of bodies before other things, as it were the first fruits of holy conduct; for these bodily ornaments are as it were an entrance to the brightness of the spirit, when they flee the stains of uncleanness and disgrace. Therefore, it behooves parents to be authors of the best things; but if they will be lazy and negligent pedagogues, and indeed found to be leaders and teachers to shameful deeds contrary to reason, they will suffer extreme punishments, as those who corrupt their own fruits and drive them into pits of destruction, for whom it was certainly just to meet death: for nature itself also prescribes this to fathers. Therefore, he who exposes a girl from himself to willing, most open disgrace, from him the Judge of all will most justly require accounts and penalties not only for the girl, but also for all who have fallen into uncleanness. For when he has stretched a certain snare and net of death, he has all caught, although not all are captured; for the outcome of the matter is not looked at altogether, but the force and faculty of the beginnings. Concerning such a woman the most wise Solomon also writes: "I found more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters."<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup> Necessarily, therefore, the lawgiver says: "Do not profane your daughter by making her a prostitute, lest the land fall into prostitution." For if there is none at all with whom the crime of fornication may be committed, it will not be difficult to escape this evil, although one may be of a mind precipitous toward pleasure, and utterly slothful to resist. When He had commanded thus far that honest purity of body be preserved for children by parents, He also punishes with death if anyone comes to the point of impelling his children to apostasy from God. Thus it is written in Leviticus: "The Lord said to Moses, ‘Say to the people of Israel, Any one of the people of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel who gives any of his children to Molech shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones. I myself will set my face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given one of his children to Molech'"<sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup> to the prince, to pollute my holy things, and to profane the name of those sanctified to me.<sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> This law is obscure; for it is not yet sufficiently clear what it means.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, if Moabites and Midianites, Gergesites and Hagrites, and some other barbarian nations, who inhabited the region of the Jews, lived according to Gentile customs and rites, and each embraced whatever religion pleased him, and worshiped and venerated whatever came rashly into his mind. And since the sons of Israel did not yet have a mind sufficiently firm and stable in the love of God, they were very prone to apostasy and so easy to defect that they considered it nothing to worship even the gods of those nations, and together with the neighboring nations to succumb to the disease of that error, which they had suffered in former times in Egypt; and so they once burned with such insane love for the young women of the Midianites that, captivated by the beauty of the women, they together with them invoked Baal-peor. Hence the lawgiver, foreseeing most prudently the weakness and fragility of their souls, absolutely forbade them to intermingle with foreigners, and said most openly: "You shall not give your daughter to his son, nor take his daughter for your son; for she will turn away your son from me, and he will serve other gods."<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup> Therefore, since it had perhaps come about (as is very likely) that some from Israel, entangled by desire for riches, betrothed their daughters to certain noble Gentile men, so that they considered apostasy and desertion of divine worship as nothing; therefore, he established a heavy and capital punishment for this crime and subjects it to most severe penalties.<sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup> For it was necessary that a woman placed in marriage with a foreigner would also bring another mindset and exhibit demon worship; and therefore he compelled her to undergo the same penalties as the corrupter and destroyer of his own fruit. Therefore, the sacred and new Scripture commands parents to strive to educate their children in the discipline of the Lord; but the slow-speaking law proceeds by circuit and roundabout way along the same path. For when it had previously decreed that parents should not permit their daughters to engage in that act which pertains to shamefulness and intemperance, then it added that it is necessary that they also preserve for them a firm and immovable knowledge of God, and not allow them to be entangled in profane, idolatrous worship; although many resources and riches are proposed to them, if they are joined in marriage by law with a foreign man indeed, but a rich one. Is this not that saying: "For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but suffers the loss of his soul?"<sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is, however, very easy for anyone to perceive that there is no small difference between those who are justified in Christ and those who are under the law:<sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup> he immediately declares what sort of parents also ought to be toward children, if they do not wish to deviate from the will of God. And indeed Paul, that most wise man, after he briefly and expediently commanded children to be subject to parents, added also this: "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup> That is, be authors of the best disciplines for them, and direct them to a life pleasing to God and most in accord with the law. But in a certain roundabout way (for thus He is accustomed to speak), He commands parents, first and most rightly, to be solicitous for the probity of their children: "Do not profane your daughter by making her a prostitute, lest the land fall into prostitution and the land become full of depravity."<sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup> For our Creator demands chastity of bodies before other things, as it were the first fruits of holy conduct; for these bodily ornaments are as it were an entrance to the brightness of the spirit, when they flee the stains of uncleanness and disgrace. Therefore, it behooves parents to be authors of the best things; but if they will be lazy and negligent pedagogues, and indeed found to be leaders and teachers to shameful deeds contrary to reason, they will suffer extreme punishments, as those who corrupt their own fruits and drive them into pits of destruction, for whom it was certainly just to meet death: for nature itself also prescribes this to fathers. Therefore, he who exposes a girl from himself to willing, most open disgrace, from him the Judge of all will most justly require accounts and penalties not only for the girl, but also for all who have fallen into uncleanness. For when he has stretched a certain snare and net of death, he has all caught, although not all are captured; for the outcome of the matter is not looked at altogether, but the force and faculty of the beginnings. Concerning such a woman the most wise Solomon also writes: "I found more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters."<sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup> Necessarily, therefore, the lawgiver says: "Do not profane your daughter by making her a prostitute, lest the land fall into prostitution." For if there is none at all with whom the crime of fornication may be committed, it will not be difficult to escape this evil, although one may be of a mind precipitous toward pleasure, and utterly slothful to resist. When He had commanded thus far that honest purity of body be preserved for children by parents, He also punishes with death if anyone comes to the point of impelling his children to apostasy from God. Thus it is written in Leviticus: "The Lord said to Moses, 'Say to the people of Israel, Any one of the people of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel who gives any of his children to Molech shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones. I myself will set my face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given one of his children to Molech'"<sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup> to associate with the ancient nations and to have dealings with foreigners was not allowed with impunity to those ancient men; but to us, Paul advises that we must live better and more confidently, saying: "If any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her. If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified through her husband."<sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup> What, then, is the rationale of dispensation in these matters? Or why did the law formerly fear union with those who thought differently, but not now? Because, assuredly, the Spirit who dwells in those who are called in Christ makes them firm and stable in the love of God; through whom and in whom we cry, "Abba, Father."<sup><a href="#fn92" id="ref92">92</a></sup> But they had not yet been enriched with this gift. For, as blessed John says: "The Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified."<sup><a href="#fn93" id="ref93">93</a></sup> Therefore, all perfection is in Christ; for the law brought nothing to perfection, as it is written.<sup><a href="#fn94" id="ref94">94</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Indeed, I desire that you explain to me, if you please, in what way that imperfection of the law can become clear.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> I will do so gladly; but our speech will proceed to the matters at hand, and will seek the reasons for charity toward neighbor; since those ancients had transmitted these things in writing through Moses more rudely than was proper.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Proceed, then, eagerly to this very point.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, the law says: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."<sup><a href="#fn95" id="ref95">95</a></sup> But our Lord Jesus Christ inculcates the law of much love to us with very many reasons, and as a kind of patron that would guard this law, He established that knowledge and will implanted in nature, which is present in each and every human being. And so He says: "Whatever you wish that men would do to you, do also to them."<sup><a href="#fn96" id="ref96">96</a></sup> For if each one strives to do for others what he himself desires to obtain, he will by no means stray from what is proper; but rather, he will proceed on the right path to charity and will obtain the crown of much love.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak well.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, charity is indeed the fulfillment of the law, but more excellent than faith and hope. For thus writes the divine man Paul. And so, weaving as it were a varied garland from spring flowers, he says again: "If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends."<sup><a href="#fn97" id="ref97">97</a></sup> But these, I think, are clear to all, and the discourse about all these things will be longer if one wishes to collect minutely what is in the New Scripture. But now let us turn to the shadows of the law, and those things which were decreed to the ancient men as if still in shadows.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You think excellently.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> The law was a certain exercise for righteousness, and as it were a house and threshold to those splendid evangelical deeds; for it is written: "The beginning of the way is good, to do the just."<sup><a href="#fn98" id="ref98">98</a></sup> For the law leads to Christ, and it does not falsely obtain the glory of that life which is understood in Christ, if it is understood spiritually, and it establishes us in righteousness; but the evangelical discipline leads beyond this besides. There are, moreover, kinds of justice: first indeed honor and love toward Him who is the one and natural God; next and near to this is that love toward brothers and people of the same kind, yet in such a way that reverence toward parents is placed before the others. Therefore, Scripture proceeds in suitable order, when after piety toward God and reverence toward parents, it commands us to exhibit an example of probity also toward other men. For everywhere the law has care for equality and decrees that an accurate account of justice must be held especially. For it is written in Deuteronomy: "You shall not have in your bag two kinds of weights, a large and a small. You shall have a full and just weight; you shall have a full and just measure, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you. For all who do such things, all who act dishonestly, are an abomination to the Lord your God."<sup><a href="#fn99" id="ref99">99</a></sup> And again in Leviticus: "You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin."<sup><a href="#fn100" id="ref100">100</a></sup> Therefore, he diligently sought to compare the kinds of justice with measures, weights, and balances, and indeed excellently; for a right and justice-loving mind in a certain way weighs and measures the nature of things, and seeks the rationale of equality more subtly and accurately than those are thought to do who test money in a scale and balance, and measure what is most fitting for each thing they contemplate, and neither does an excess of quality corrupt the exquisite beauty, nor again does a diminution allow that which is sufficient by the rationale of equality to be adulterated. Let there be, therefore, a just balance and just weights, and a just measure, he says. These, however, I think, are as it were certain figures and clear examples, which show us the modes by which an accurate account of equality may be sought from us, and the knowledge of justice may appear. But note that those things which are in the law are measured, and justice is as it were terminated as an end; but those things which have been handed down through Christ are more ample and progress far further; for that which is just is exceeded by the good, that is, by the glory of Christian conduct.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak splendidly; for I remember that Christ said openly to those who were justified by faith: "Truly, I say to you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."<sup><a href="#fn101" id="ref101">101</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> But let these things be established in this manner. Now, if it seems good, let us investigate the measure of Mosaic probity, and the glory of justice according to the law. For he who rightly strives to attain the knowledge of justice, and thinks it great to excel in loving brothers, ought to be seen as firm and stable, and finally such as he really is, not weak and fickle, nor endowed with feigned probity and covering the form of a wolf with sheep's skin, but rather striving to retain the naked and blameless freedom of his own character. Therefore, the law says: "You shall not go about as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not stand up against the life of your neighbor."<sup><a href="#fn102" id="ref102">102</a></sup> It also places the same matter differently: "You shall not wear cloth of wool and linen mixed together."<sup><a href="#fn103" id="ref103">103</a></sup> And again: "You shall not wear a garment of cloth made of two kinds of material."<sup><a href="#fn104" id="ref104">104</a></sup> For indeed a most grave crime, and for which no reproach is sufficient, is that deceit and fraud in the opinion of probity; and this thing is in the first place hateful to God, and almost always has a cognate duplicity of soul, and that saying as a kind of two-formed and varied monster; by these things that divine and immortal mind is most greatly moved to anger. For He certainly said concerning some: "Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceitfully; with his mouth each speaks peaceably to his neighbor, but in his heart he plans an ambush for him. Shall I not punish them for these things? declares the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn105" id="ref105">105</a></sup> David also says that he who will ascend to the mountain of God is one with innocent hands and a pure heart, who does not deceive with his tongue and does no evil to his neighbor.<sup><a href="#fn106" id="ref106">106</a></sup> Therefore, the law forbids as a most shameful and especially absurd thing that anyone should walk in deceit, that is, that he should embrace a cunning and astute manner of life, and while simulating the appearance of justice, despising the laws of charity, he should harm brothers. Moreover, it does not allow us to have a garment woven of two materials; in which it signifies figuratively that we must beware lest we admit as it were a certain duplicity into the soul; moreover, I say that internal and spiritual duplicity is that execrable desire of pleasing men, which is as it were woven from two endeavors, differing not a little from each other. For what or of what sort is the life of hypocrites, except that in the sight of men they appear and seem to be good men, yet are not truly good?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Certainly so.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, our morals are double, woven from dissimilar wills. But blessed David approves a man of one character, and says he is worthy to be held by supernal providence: "Lord, who shall sojourn in your tent? He who walks blamelessly."<sup><a href="#fn107" id="ref107">107</a></sup> God is also said to scatter the bones of men-pleasers. The same vice Paul also execrates, when he says: "For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ."<sup><a href="#fn108" id="ref108">108</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> To whom is it not obscure that it is certainly absurd and most alien from the right rule of living to be of double mind and to pretend?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Therefore, the fruit of perfect charity, and that which befits a just and good man, is to be alien from deceit. Therefore, the law says that a man wholly devoted to the study of justice and loving fraternal charity ought to be reckoned, that the glory of this matter is perfect if he not only himself avoids harming another, but is also a teacher to others in this matter, who are either connected by kinship or in some other way touch him and are bound to him by the name of necessity. Paul also commands that he who is to have care of churches should have children subject, and uses this as an argument by which it may be understood whether there is probity of character in him or not, when he says: "For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church?"<sup><a href="#fn109" id="ref109">109</a></sup> Therefore, the law for this reason, as in the manner of a likeness and evident image, says: "When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten, but the owner of the ox shall not be liable. But if the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has been warned but has not kept it in, and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. If a ransom is imposed on him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is imposed on him. If it gores a man's son or daughter, he shall be dealt with according to this same rule. If it gores a slave, male or female, the owner shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned."<sup><a href="#fn110" id="ref110">110</a></sup> Is the response of God clear to you in this place?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Not very much, indeed.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Attend, therefore, to what I will say, and before other things note the words of blessed Paul writing: "Is it for oxen that God is concerned? Does he not certainly speak for our sake?"<sup><a href="#fn111" id="ref111">111</a></sup> Therefore, he compares a man who is insolent and arrogant, and who can inflict violence, to an ox. For this animal is for the most part proud and swollen, and very strong for fighting, and its attack is difficult to sustain. Such a man, therefore, he says, if he is domestic and as it were subject to some just and good man, and weakens or indeed even kills someone, overwhelming him with unjust power, the crime committed is ordered to be atoned by death; for it is fitting, he says, that he die by stoning. But he removes the owner from this penalty if he was ignorant of the unjust morals, and is found to have been by no means a companion of wickedness; for the crimes of others are not ours if they are committed without our knowledge. But he forbids eating the flesh of the ox; in which he secretly signifies under the figure of eating and sharing that we ought not to be partakers of others' impurity. Is this not clearly that saying: "Keep yourself pure, and do not share in the sins of others"?<sup><a href="#fn112" id="ref112">112</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Most certainly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> At the same time, he decrees that the owner also is to be condemned with the ox if he knew of the injury inflicted and is convicted of not having been ignorant of his iniquity; for indeed to be able to restrain unjust morals and easily prohibit injury, but to be unwilling to do so, and that especially on purpose, almost indicates that the man was a companion in the wrongdoing, and as far as pertains to will and common counsel, with those who wish to commit something against right, he also wished to contribute his effort in that matter. Such a man, therefore, he says, is to be punished with death, unless the judges impose a price for such crimes committed. For the law looks to clemency, and to the partnership of will in sinning, and the concurrence of consent alone. "He is punished more lightly," he says, "if the judges so decide." Now receive the figure transferred to the signification of truth: for that Judge of all avenges most grave crimes with death; yet He allows those who have sinned to offer prices by which sins may be paid: namely tears of penitence, the labor of conversion, and the measure of almsgiving. "For mercy triumphs over judgment,"<sup><a href="#fn113" id="ref113">113</a></sup> according to the Scriptures. With diligent distinction also the law distinguishes those who are affected by injury: for, if the ox kills a son or daughter, he says, let him die, and let there be no place for mercy; but if a slave or maidservant, let money be exacted for them. What, then, is the rationale of this distinction? How can it be, and is it not unworthy, especially since the difference between free and slave in us is not a vice of nature, such as bad health undoubtedly is, but arises from the oppression of the more powerful? "For the same God made us all, and He is the one Father of all,"<sup><a href="#fn114" id="ref114">114</a></sup> according to the prophet's voice. Does our Creator, then, ascribe the condition of slavery to some even as a crime? Does servile condition also count for nothing with Him, and does freedom enjoy greater glory? By no means: "For in Christ Jesus there is neither slave nor free."<sup><a href="#fn115" id="ref115">115</a></sup> Therefore, because the law is a shadow, by son and daughter the free kind of holy men is signified; but by slave and maidservant that still servile kind, and subject to the yoke of sin. Therefore, injury done to saints and to sinners is not equal, nor are sins committed against both punished with the same measure: for that these and those are by nature brothers is clear to all; but yet the condition of the saints is spiritual excellence, and superior by the sublimity of virtues and so dear to God that they are held in the place of sons and daughters, and surpass human and servile measure. Moreover, to cultivate piety and retain charity toward brothers, the law persuades by other modes also, which we will also, when we have set them forth in order, speak about each as it comes to mind. For it says again: "If anyone opens a pit, or digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it, the owner of the pit shall make it good. He shall give money to its owner, and the dead beast shall be his."<sup><a href="#fn116" id="ref116">116</a></sup> This, however, is figuratively: not to place a stumbling block or scandal for a brother, nor to allow what is by nature useful to become useless to some; nor to allow what is necessary for us and others for life to seem to open a way to death. For does not he who opens or digs a pit effect something useful and necessary for himself and others? Do not, he says, let your affairs offer to another an occasion of danger. "For charity," as blessed Paul says, "does not seek its own,"<sup><a href="#fn117" id="ref117">117</a></sup> but thinks rather also of what belongs to others.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> Who, then, is this who opens or digs a pit, what also is the pit, I would indeed like to know clearly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> It is not obscure what the history signifies; for he says the pit ought to be covered lest some harm happen from it. But let him know, he says, who neglects to do this, if something falls in, that he will pay money to the owner of that thing; but the dead corpse will be his. But if we leave those things which are open in the history and pass over that deed to spiritual understanding, it can be said by us that the pit in these words is called by the law the knowledge of divinely inspired Scripture, and the discourse about the holy and consubstantial Trinity, and the knowledge of Christ's mystery: for these are placed as in a depth and have life-giving force; of which thing the Savior Himself is a witness, saying: "And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent."<sup><a href="#fn118" id="ref118">118</a></sup> Therefore, he who reads the ancient writings, and investigates the divine words of Scripture not without labor, and seeks accurate and uncorrupted knowledge, is most similar to one digging a pit, for he seeks life-giving water, and the fountain, and the torrent of delight.<sup><a href="#fn119" id="ref119">119</a></sup> But he who attains to that prudence, that he can hand down the discourse of that mystery in his writings, opens a pit; for he brings forth something new, he does not build upon others' sweat, but by his own labors he helps both himself and others. False lovers of knowledge also dig broken pits, according to the prophet's voice;<sup><a href="#fn120" id="ref120">120</a></sup> whoever, therefore, digs a pit, let him beware, he says, lest what seems well done in some way bring destruction to his name. For we ought to speak words about God rightly and diligently, so that we do not give occasion of scandal to the name. And that is, I think, to have a cover placed on the pit: namely that the discourse not be without suitable caution. For if an ox or donkey falls, he who labored in constructing the pit shall pay. He calls the ox and donkey not simply, but with hidden rationale: and the ox, he says, so that you may understand the sacred and pure kind of men; but the donkey, the profane and impure; for it is not offered to God in sacrifice. Moreover, we say the sacred and pure kind are those who are already sanctified through Him; the profane and impure those who are not yet cleansed by holy baptism, but still have the stains of sin imprinted. It is, therefore, just as if he said: If some damage happens to any of those who are already baptized and sealed through grace for entering into union with God, or certainly to those who are not yet such, the author of that scandal will be much liable, and the examination of the corpse, that is, the death of him who suffered the damage, will pertain to him. Therefore, the Savior Himself also warns us, saying: "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea."<sup><a href="#fn121" id="ref121">121</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> You speak rightly.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Moreover, you will easily see that the law also indicates by other figures how dangerous it is to sin, and this against brothers; for in that we strike their weak conscience, our offense pertains to Christ. And therefore He says: "If fire breaks out and catches in thorns so that the stacked grain or the standing grain or the field is consumed, he who started the fire shall make full restitution."<sup><a href="#fn122" id="ref122">122</a></sup> For it is not fitting that what is useful perish together with those things which by their own nature burn, nor that what is cultivated be consumed together with the wild things.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Palladius:</span> In what way, then, is that?</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">Cyril:</span> Can the writings of impious heretics and the deceptions of Gentile dogmas not most fittingly be compared to mountainous and wild thorns? Can any utility from them flow into the souls of men? Or rather, is not destruction brought to those who wish to admit them into their soul? For fire consumes only thorns as fuel; they also kindle for us eternal flames, both the vain dogmas of those who err and the old wives' tales of idolaters. But grain and wheat are the sweetest food, most fit for men to eat and necessary for use; it contains us in life and can be a figure of the dogmas of truth, through which we who believe are fed by Christ, as by the living and true bread. Again, the field is flat and not at all rough to those who know how to walk through it rightly, the divinely inspired Scripture: "For all things are plain to those who understand,"<sup><a href="#fn123" id="ref123">123</a></sup> as it is written, "and right to those who find knowledge."<sup><a href="#fn124" id="ref124">124</a></sup> Therefore, the thorn is indeed that most execrable and profane loquacity of perverse men; but the wheat and grain is the word of truth, which brings utility to souls and is most apt for nourishing; the plain field is the divine Scripture. When, therefore, the words of holy teachers, bearing the patronage of the dogma of truth, make an assault like flames or fire upon the figments of heretics and Gentiles, let them run, he says, only through the thorns, and burn their writings as useless and wild material; but let them not at the same time touch the wheat or grains, that is, let the teachers take care that they do not violate anything of the dogmas of truth. But let him know, he says, who did not labor to do this cautiously, if it happens that any of those things which are necessary for use are burned together with the vitiated, that he will pay the penalty for imprudence. Do you see, then, how much caution the lawgiver commanded us to use, everywhere preserving pure and undisturbed sincerity of charity toward brothers?</p>
