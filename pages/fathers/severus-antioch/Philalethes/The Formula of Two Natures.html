    <h1>The Formula of Two Natures</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;"> FROM SAINT SEVERUS, PRIEST AND ARCHIMANDRITE IN PALESTINE, WHO LATER BECAME PATRIARCH OF ANTIOCH.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In his dark and sacrilegious intention, the author of this libel of chapters amputated (from their context), under the pretext of refuting the atheistic delirium of the Eutychians, introduces, in truth, a defense of what was defined at Chalcedon by the synod assembled there, and divides our one Lord and God, Jesus Christ, in two, by saying two natures after the union. The apology for the chapters which is found below, carefully examines each chapter. It cites integrally the words of Saint Cyril which the author of the libel has impiously truncated — there are places where he added, inventing certain things, but how many times also has he cut out! — so that, careful everywhere for the truth, we might make appear, from his words, the thought of the wise Cyril, who professes everywhere one nature of the incarnate God Word, (a formula) which reveals the authentic thought of the teachings of Saint Cyril.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The name of the book is Cyril or the Philalethe — which means: the lover of the truth — against those who alter his (texts), truncate them and assemble them impiously, with the aim of dividing Emmanuel, by saying he is two natures after the union. The calumny is bitter, yes, truly bitter, and how many times it can turn away from the path leading to the truth! That is why the prophet David also cried out in a prayer to the God of the universe: "Deliver me from the calumny of men and I will keep your commandments!"<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> We learn from the book of Proverbs that calumny debases man<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>; and these inventors of malignant and miserable heresies, it is shown that it dares to attack the glory of God and applies itself to abase the Most High. To prefer an inadmissible idea to the divine books is grave and falls under the accusation of impiety; but that the inspired words, spoken by the Fathers and doctors of the Church and written with the thought of destroying the error of heresies, should be exhibited by these wrongdoers for the establishment of that same error; how would that not surpass every degree of impiety? The motive for these considerations? I have taken in hand a libel composed by an impious man; I have read it cursing it and truly groaning, my spirit entirely saddened!</p>
        <p class="paragraph">It is that the author of this seductive delirium — I will not say of this collection — has dared to calumniate Saint Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria and the doctor of the world, who alone, more than all his peers, brought precision and clarity, so to speak, to the doctrine concerning the inhumanation. Indeed, after having read, so to speak, all his God-given books and having amputated, with the scissors of impiety, members of their body, from every joint and articulation, this blasphemer has confected a tunic woven from below, while from the earth he raises his voice enunciating vanities<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>, as the prophet said, and that he strikes in the void<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, the wretch! He strives therefore to demonstrate that the venerable herald of the orthodox faith has written things conforming to those which were defined perversely at Chalcedon by those who assembled there, that he speaks of two natures after the union and that he has divided the one Christ.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For us, before beginning the exposition of the refutation of these chapters detached in a perverse and impious manner, we deem it necessary to enunciate first brief (considerations), which will clearly highlight for readers the difference there is between saying "one unique nature of the incarnate God Word" and saying "two natures". And we will define Emmanuel, concerning whom the Fathers have transmitted to us to believe that the God Word, who was begotten of the Father without beginning and eternally, impassibly and incorporeally, the Only-Begotten, for our salvation, in the last days, took flesh from the Holy Spirit and from the holy Mother of God and ever-virgin Mary, a flesh consubstantial with us, endowed with a rational and intelligent soul, without it having subsisted before the descent of the God Word into the Virgin's womb. For if it had been so, it would have been a lie to say: the Word became incarnate. If, on the contrary, it is true that the Word became incarnate, it is clear that he was not absent from the conception, but that, — such is our faith, — it is in the first moment and at the precise instant when the angel Gabriel made this announcement to the Virgin and said: "Rejoice, full of joy, the Lord is with you!"<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> that the hypostasis of the God Word, the Power of the Most High Father, dwelt in the Virgin in an incomprehensible, inexplicable manner and which he alone knows. Also he is said to have been conceived and born according to the flesh, by the fact that he united to himself a body naturally apt to be conceived and born, — possessing, it is understood, a rational and intelligent soul, — without assuming the body for the completion of his hypostasis: he was, indeed, without deficiency and perfect in all, as God. He who was in the form<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>, understand in the essence, of God and in the equality of the Father, while remaining immutably in what he was, took a body from a woman, — this is the hypostatic union, — and, thus born, he made the Virgin appear as Mother of God. It is thus that he was called Emmanuel, because, from two natures which are perfect according to their proper reason, the same was God and man at the same time. For the expression "God with us" — which is the translation of Emmanuel — marks this: that the God Word united our entire essence, without leaving anything out of that in which the man that we are is constituted. He was rendered, indeed, in all like his brothers<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>, except for sin, in order to provide complete redemption for those who had fallen under sin. From the moment therefore when the Word came to dwell in the Virgin, when he united our nature — understand a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul — and appropriated it to himself by the economy, it is not possible to find a moment where the flesh was separated from the Word. Indeed, it was not constituted apart, devoid of union with the God Word; it was therefore constituted for him without being separated (from him): it is in being constituted and coming into existence that the created flesh was united to the Word who was before the ages and uncreated, to the point that it is by an artifice that we distinguish the human things and that we say two natures the one Christ. The spirit, indeed, represents the diversity of nature of the elements which were gathered into a unity, I mean the divinity and the humanity; but, when the thought of the union is added to that, it does not permit saying two he who was assembled, from two things, into an indivisible unity. Whence it is necessary, logical and conforming to the mystery of the divine inhumanation, to confess one unique nature of the incarnate God Word. For that makes appear both the indivisible union and that the flesh remained itself what it was, that it did not pass into the nature of the Word, that the Word also was not transformed into the flesh, but that there was inhumanation, truly, and not by transformation nor by false appearance.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">(As proof) that it is indeed so, I will cite for you testimonies of the theophoric Fathers. OF SAINT PETER, ARCHBISHOP AND MARTYR, from the book "On the Divinity"<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>: "From then on the evangelist is truthful, when he says: 'The Word became flesh and dwelt among us'<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>, namely from the moment when the angel saluted the Virgin and said to her: 'Rejoice, full of joy, the Lord is with you!'<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> What must be understood now in the mouth of Gabriel for: 'God the Word is with you!' For he signified that (the Word) himself would be born in the womb and would become flesh, according to what is written: 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will dwell in you. Therefore the holy one who will be born (from you) will be called Son of God.'<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>" AND FURTHER ON<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>: [PETER] "God the Word, without the intervention of a man, by the will of God who can accomplish all, became flesh in the womb of the Virgin, without having had need of the action nor the approach of a man. For the power of God did more than man in her, by dwelling in the Virgin with the Holy Spirit who came upon her."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">OF SAINT ATHANASIUS, BISHOP OF ALEXANDRIA, from the Letter to Epictetus<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>: "And how have those who are called Christians dared to doubt that, if it is the Lord who came forth from Mary, he is Son of God by essence and by nature, and that he is, according to the flesh, of the seed of David and of the flesh of Saint Mary? And who are those who have been so temerarious as to say that Christ, who suffered and was crucified in the flesh, is not Lord and God, Redeemer and Son of the Father?"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">OF SAINT THEOPHILUS, BISHOP OF ALEXANDRIA, from the Festal Letter<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>: "The wise skillful above all, the Word of God who lives and acts, has disposed all in a harmonious order. It is not by taking a body from some celestial matter that he came to us, but he made appear in the clay the greatness of his know-how. Straightening man who had been formed from the clay, he himself came forth, man, from the Virgin in a new apparatus: if he differs by the mode of generation, he judges however that he must not flee the resemblance in all with us: he is born, he is wrapped in swaddling clothes, nurses and is laid as a child in a manger, taking the weakness of our nature for the reasons previously (enunciated)."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">OF SAINT CYRIL, BISHOP OF ALEXANDRIA, from the third Letter to Nestorius. The first chapter of the twelve<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>: "If anyone does not confess that Emmanuel is truly God, and that for this reason the Holy Virgin is Mother of God, — she has, indeed, borne according to the flesh the God Word who became flesh, — let him be anathema!" OF THE SAME, from the same letter. The second chapter of the twelve<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "If anyone does not confess that the Word, who is from God the Father, was hypostatically united to a flesh and that Christ is one with his flesh, the same, that is to say at the same time God and man, let him be anathema!" OF THE SAME, from the Apology of this second chapter, or anathematism, against the criticisms of Theodore<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "We say that there was a hypostatic union, the word 'hypostatic' indicating nothing other than this: the nature of the Word, or the hypostasis which is the Word, once truly united to the human nature, without change or confusion, as we have said frequently, Christ is recognized and is one, the same, God and man." OF THE SAME, from the Letter to the monks, of which here is the beginning: "Some have arrived as usual..."<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> [CYRIL] "The mystery which concerns him presents an analogy with our childbearing. Indeed, the mothers of those who are on earth, obeying nature for generation, have in their womb a flesh, which little by little takes body and, thanks to inexplicable operations of God, develops there and is completed into a human appearance; and God breathes the spirit into the living being in a manner of which he has the secret. 'He has formed, indeed, the spirit of man within him'<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>, according to the word of the prophet. For one thing is the reason of the flesh and, similarly, another that of the soul. But, although they have become mothers only of the bodies which come from the earth, they nevertheless give birth to the entire living being, to him, I say, who is of soul and body, and they are not said to bear only a part. No one would say either, for example, that Elizabeth is mother of a flesh and that she is not moreover the mother of a soul. For she bore the Baptist therefore of a soul, and a man made of two (elements), of a soul, I say, and a body. We will admit that something analogous was accomplished also at the birth of Emmanuel. In fact, it is from the essence of God the Father that the Only-Begotten Word became, as I have said; but since, in taking a flesh and making it his own, he was called Son of Man and became like us, it is not at all out of place to say, but rather necessary to confess, that he was born according to the flesh by a woman, in the same manner as the soul of a man is also born with his body and is reputed to be one thing with him, although by nature it is recognized and is other according to its proper reason, outside of him. Even, if one wanted to say that the mother of such a one is mother of a flesh and that she is not moreover the mother of a soul, one would express things entirely vain. For she gave birth, as I have said, to a living being, composed in all wisdom of dissimilar elements and which, from the two, is nevertheless one unique man. Each of them remaining what it was, they concurred together in a natural union, as if they had the one and the other mixed, which (comes back) to each of them as being his own proper good."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">OF SAINT GREGORY THE THEOLOGIAN, BISHOP OF NAZIANZUS, from the Letter to Cledonius<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>: "If anyone says that a man was formed and that then God dwelt in him, he is condemned. For that is not for God to be born (truly), but to hide from the birth." AND A LITTLE AFTER<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>: [GREGORY] "If anyone says that (God) acted (in him) by grace as in a prophet, and not that he was joined to him according to the essence and that he was formed with him, let him be deprived of the action of the Word and be rather filled with that which is contrary to it!"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Behold that all the theophoric doctors of the Church confess equally that the God Word was conceived in the womb of the Virgin, Mother of God. For he was hypostatically united to a flesh which had come, and, while remaining immutable and unalterable, he appropriated it to himself, without being separated from it in time, which is subject to division. The word of the Archangel also bears witness. He did not, indeed, begin by saying to the Virgin: "The holy one who will be born from you will be called Son of God" and then added: "For the power of the Most High will dwell in you." But on the contrary: "The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will dwell in you; therefore the holy one who will be born will be called Son of God"<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>, to show clearly that the Word, Son of God, would become flesh and would not be transformed into the flesh. For the shadow of a change<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> is incompatible with the divine nature. But in making his own the birth of the flesh, since he is said in truth to have been formed himself in the womb, he is born also of the Holy Virgin, Mother of God.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">However, those who divide into two natures our one Lord Jesus-Christ are not of the opinion that it is so. But, forming first the man in the womb of the Virgin and making him subsist in isolation, they say that it is in this state that the God Word dwelt in him, and they cover this dwelling with the beautiful appellation of union; in consequence of which, logically, following their idea, they divide Emmanuel into two natures. If, on the contrary, they were penetrated by the inspired writings and the teachings of the theophoric Fathers, in the way that we have just noted, they would understand that it is the God Word who became incarnate from the Virgin. And, as he made his own, from the very principle of its formation and subsistence, the flesh issued from Mary, endowed, it is understood, with an intelligent soul, they would recognize the one Emmanuel from two natures, the flesh being without separation in relation to the Word by the virtue of the inexplicable union and which surpasses all intelligence, and they would never count it apart nor introduce a superior number into the Holy Trinity; confessing on the contrary one unique nature of the incarnate God Word, and they would make appear the (elements) from which he is the one and only Christ, and they would hold themselves apart from the entirely impious division.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For my part, I am seized with admiration before this word of the Fathers inspired by God: how it is complete and far from every defective opinion! Indeed, in saying "one unique nature of the God Word", they have shown that, when he became incarnate, the Word did not abandon his own nature, but that he subsists immutably and without deviation, and that he is in the perfect state, without having lost or left anything of his own hypostasis. And from the fact that they said "incarnate", they have indicated that the flesh did not depart from being flesh and that it was not constituted in isolation, separated from the union with the Word. From then on it is with just reason that the nature of the Word is said unique. Before all the ages, indeed, it existed apart, simple and not composite; the flesh, it, was not constituted apart, but (only) when the Word willed to take the resemblance with us, except for sin<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>. For the word "incarnate", in showing the sublime union which affects the Word, gives to understand "flesh coming from Mary", and not (flesh) separated, apart from it, so that, from the two natures, the divinity and the humanity, one unique Christ came forth from Mary. And it is clear that the same is at the same time God and man, consubstantial with the Father according to the divinity and consubstantial with us, men, the same, according to the humanity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But we must also cite the testimonies of the perverse heretics, so that readers may know that it is by making first subsist the man issued from Mary and by saying after that that the God Word dwelt in him, that they have come to confess that the one Christ is two natures. OF DIODORE OF TARSUS, the teacher of the impious Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>: "While the flesh was (that) of Mary, without having yet been assumed, it was of the earth and differed in nothing from other fleshes. Now, just as Levi was chosen, while he was in the womb<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>, but it is in being born that he received the dignity, thus also when the Lord was in the womb of the Virgin, issued from her essence, he did not possess the dignity of the filiation; but it is when he had taken (human) figure, when he had become a temple for the God Word, and when he had welcomed the Only-Begotten, that he received the dignity of the name (of Son) and received afterwards also (something) of the very dignity (of the filiation)."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">OF SAINT CYRIL, a text contrary to these (assertions) in the Treatise against the same Diodore<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>: "I say, my dear, that you utter ignorant words and profoundly marked by folly. The holy flesh, indeed, is well come from Mary, but from the first instants of the assemblage (of its parts), or of its constitution in the womb, it was holy, as the body of Christ, and one could not see a moment where it was not his, but rather common, as you have said, and in a state identical to that of other fleshes."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">OF THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS, a text in agreement with these (assertions) of Diodore, in the work which he entitled "Of the Dogma", of which here is the beginning: "The doctrine of piety is the goal of those who enter the Church..."<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> "My dear, Mary did not bear the divinity. For what is born of the flesh is flesh. A creature has not begotten the Uncreated! It is not a new God Word that the Father made to be born from the Virgin. 'In the beginning was the Word'<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>, as John said. A creature therefore did not beget the Uncreated, but she bore a man, the organ of the divinity. The Holy Spirit did not create the God Word — for 'that which is in her', it is said, 'is of the Holy Spirit'<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup> — but he established for the God Word a temple which comes from the Virgin. God did not die, when he made himself man, but he raised up that in which he made himself man." AND ELSEWHERE, in the Eulogy of Saint Thecla, a homily which begins as follows: "The wise organization of the Lord's coming..."<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup> [NESTORIUS] "That is why, it is to the man, the temple, that the blessed Paul attributes the birth." ELSEWHERE AGAIN, concerning the inhumanation, a homily which begins as follows: "I have glorified the distinction of the economy of the Lord..."<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> [NESTORIUS] "Confess the temple, but join to it he who dwells in it. Let the temple which is his adhere to the God Word, without stripping God who inhabits it of his temple, nor removing the temple from the divinity." AND ANOTHER (PASSAGE) AGAIN, in the Eulogy of Saint Thecla<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>: [NESTORIUS] "Come then, confessing the natures and now the conjunction of the natures, we say unique the dignity and unique the sovereignty, both of the temple and of him who raises the temple, but two natures."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Is it not evident to anyone, by what has just been cited, that by setting aside the God Word from the birth in the flesh and by declaring that he rather dwelt in a man who was constituted apart, these wretches confess two natures and suppress manifestly the hypostatic union of the natures, from which flows the confession of one unique nature of the incarnate God Word, and the negation of two natures after the union? Listen therefore to what Theodoret also said. Pretending that he fears mixture and that one thinks the God Word took his origin from Mary, he expresses himself, with unveiled face, contrary to the words of the Gospel, and he maintains that the Word did not become flesh, but that he rather dwelt in the temple issued from the Virgin.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">FROM THE VERY IMPIOUS THEODORET, what he said against the first of the chapters, or anathematisms, of Saint Cyril<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>: "If therefore the Word did not become flesh, but took a living and intelligent flesh, he is not, himself, according to (his) nature, born of the Virgin, by being known, formed, acquiring (human) figure, and drawing from there the principle of his being, he who is before the ages, is God, is with the Father, is alongside the Father, is known and adored with the Father. But by having formed for himself a temple in the virginal womb, he was with that which had been formed, known, had acquired (human) figure and had been born." FROM THE SAME, from the criticism of the second chapter or anathematism<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>: [THEODORET] "We confess one unique Christ, having faith in the divine teachings of the apostles, and we call the same, because of the union, God and man. But we are totally ignorant of the hypostatic union, as being absent and unknown from the divine books and from the Fathers who have explained them."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">One has therefore already recognized by these citations, that those who say the unique Christ is two natures, do not believe that the Word became flesh according to the divine books, that is to say truly man, while remaining God, and that they do not confess the hypostatic union, by virtue of which they would profess the Emmanuel unique from two natures and would no longer speak then of two natures after the union. It is henceforth logical to research how, in their shame before the two natures which entail a duality of sons, they hypocritically say one unique Son, by inventing a sort of fraudulent and lying union! They say, indeed, that the nature of the Word conferred upon the human nature the appellation of Son and of Lord, and (something) of the dignity which befits God, and of the power and of the equality (with it). And they say that inversely the God Word attributes to himself, by communication, the names of Christ and of Jesus which befit the human nature or the condition of a slave, as also the sufferings which befall it, the insults, the blows, the strikes, the cross and the other (trials) which befit man. — For he underwent, they say, the insult of servants of birth who are maltreated by their master. — It is in this manner that (according to them) the insult of the wounds, the pains of the passion, the burial and the death which lasted three days (are found) also in the God Word. Thus therefore, a transmission of the appellations, an equality of name, a donation of the dignity befitting God, a communion in friendship and in sufferings and a communication, behold what these artisans and sophists of a piety which leads to the pit call union! It is in this manner that they have attributed two natures, (two) persons and (two) hypostases to the person of the unique Christ and Monogenes Son. And this will clearly emerge from their corrupt words. They (there) are surprised as staggering from drunkenness<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> and speaking from the abundance of the heart<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>, following the word of the Lord who does not lie, in giving the name of two natures, or forms, to two sons, (two) Christs, (two) lords.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">FROM THEODORET THE HERETIC, who declares that one must not say two true sons, but rather one who is so by nature, he who comes from God the Father, and one who is so by adoption, he who is issued from the seed of David<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>: "It is by grace that the man issued from Mary is Son, it is by nature that the God Word is (Son). But he who is so by grace, and not by nature, and he who is so by nature, and not by grace, are they not two sons? Let the filiation by grace, the glory, the immortality, suffice for the body taken from us, because it has become the temple of the God Word. But let us not go beyond nature, and let not the God Word, by way of the thanksgiving which is due to him, be the object of our insults! And in what would the insult consist? In being in composition with a body and in being thought to have need of a body for (realizing) the complete filiation. For the God Word does not want to be himself the Son of David, but rather his Lord<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>. That the body, on the other hand, be called Son of David, not only does he not view it with malevolence, but it is for that that he came." FROM THE SAME<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup>: [THEODORET] "If someone wants, so to speak, to also call the Son of God, the Word of God, Son of David, let him call him (thus) in consideration of the temple of the Word which comes from David; and he who comes from the seed of David, let him name him Son of God by grace, and not by nature." AND A LITTLE AFTER<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>: [THEODORET] "Let us confess the natures and not deny the economy!"</p>

    <p class="paragraph">FROM NESTORIUS THE HERETIC<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>: "For it is the Son of God that the Virgin, Mother of Christ, bore. However, as the Son of God is double according to the natures, she did not bear the Son of God, but she bore the humanity which is Son, because of the Son who is joined to it." FROM THE SAME<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup>: [NESTORIUS] "When therefore, the divine Scripture must speak either of the birth or of the death of the Christ who is issued from the Virgin Mary, nowhere does one see it employ the word 'God', but either 'Christ' or 'Son' or 'Lord', because these three (terms) are expressive of two natures, sometimes of this one, sometimes of that one, and sometimes of this one and that one." FROM THE SAME<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup>: [NESTORIUS] "Well then, while confessing the natures and maintaining the conjunction of the natures, while saying a unique dignity and a unique sovereignty, both of the temple and of him who inhabits the temple, (we say) on the other hand two natures, to also confess our redemption: I say the humanity and that by which he accomplished the redemption, namely by the dignity of the divinity." FROM THE SAME<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup>: [NESTORIUS] "Say that he who assumed is God. Add that he who was assumed is the form of a slave. Bring after that the dignity of the conjunction, because for the two the power is common, because for the two the dignity is the same, the natures maintaining themselves. Confess a union of dignity." AND A LITTLE AFTER<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup>: [NESTORIUS] "Confess the temple, but join to it he who inhabits it. Let the temple which is his adhere to the God Word, without stripping God who inhabits it of his temple, nor separating the temple from the divinity which inhabits it. Say he who is raised and confess with him he who raised him!" AND HE SAID ELSEWHERE AGAIN.<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup>: [NESTORIUS] "It is for that that the God Word is also called Christ, because he is in perpetual conjunction with the Christ." AND AGAIN<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup>: [NESTORIUS] "Keeping therefore without confusion the conjunction of the natures, let us confess the God who is in the temple, let us adore the man who, by virtue of the divine conjunction, is adored with God the Almighty."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">FROM THE IMPIOUS ANDREW OF SAMOSATA, who spoke against the twelve chapters, or anathematisms, of Saint Cyril; from the criticism of the first anathematism<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup>: "While the Magi coming from Persia, in search of him who was born, were guided by him, they rejoined him. And when they had found him, they presented homage and offerings both to him who was knowable (by the spirit) and to him who was visible."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">FROM THE WRETCHED THEODORET, from the criticism of the fourth anathematism<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup>: "Henceforth the ignorance is not on the part of the God Word, but of the form of a slave, which, at that time, knew these things to the extent that the divinity which inhabited it had revealed them (to it)."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">It results therefore from the impious words which have just been cited, that they say two natures, or forms, and two sons, one true and the other adoptive, and two Christs; that, by the conjunction of dignity and of sovereignty and the community of names, they give themselves the appearance of saying one unique Son and one unique Christ; that they manifest that it is by frustrating the propriety of the words that they say union like a conjunction of friendship of the natures or of the forms. We recognize the (character) blasphematory of their ideas by what is (here) cited.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS, from the treatise which is entitled: "To those who say that the divinity of Christ and his humanity became one unique nature."<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> "For, while these (entities) are according to their nature so distant from one another, the union makes appear a unique person, without however confusing the property which (belongs) to each of the natures, but by keeping firm their characteristics." FROM THE SAME, from the letter which he wrote from Ephesus to one of his familiars<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup>: [NESTORIUS] "Cyril has simply withdrawn from our conversation. He has also withdrawn from the reproach, which emerges from the chapters he has written, that they are without contradiction heretical: he thinks thus to charge them! How therefore does your admirable person welcome such calumny against us? And that, while it remembers that at Constantinople also we have spoken in this manner of the two words concerning the mystery of the economy and of the inexplicable union. Do not believe therefore so easily, I beg you, the calumnies at our expense! We think indeed that the word 'Mother of God', placed alongside that of 'Mother of man', is the very precise mark of piety. For 'Christ', or 'Jesus', or 'Son', or 'Monogenes', give to understand these two appellations. And for those who do not accept this word (of 'Mother of God') as designating the two natures, the divinity and the humanity, we put before their eyes the word 'Mother of God' and the word 'Mother of man', so that nowhere can it escape that we fall neither into Manichaeism nor into (the error) of Paul (of Samosate). He who says, indeed, that he who is perfectly consubstantial to us is born of the Virgin, without being sure of the divinity, proclaims in its integrity the mystery of the economy of the Lord."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Behold manifestly that by calling the Holy Virgin 'Mother of God' and 'Mother of man', and by linking the one to the other the two natures by the sole community of the appellations of 'Christ', of 'Son', of 'Lord', of 'Jesus' and of 'Monogenes', he has called (this) equality of name inexplicable union. And he who is born perfect from Mary, he has also said him not separated from the divinity, namely according to the mode of habitation. Now, if he had confessed the hypostatic union of the natures and if he had accepted to say one unique Christ from two natures, he would not have said two natures after the union, but one unique nature of the incarnate God Word, as the theophoric Fathers have proclaimed it. And since the impious Theodoret has been stricken with the same folly as Nestorius, listen to what union of natures he too imagined to declare. FROM THEODORET THE HERETIC, from what he said against the first chapter of the twelve of Saint Cyril<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup>: "We proclaim the Virgin not (only) Mother of man, but also Mother of God, basing that appellation on the conformation, on the formation and on the generation, and this one on the union." FROM THE SAME, from what he said against the third chapter<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup>: [THEODORET] "To confess in this manner a unique person, a unique Son and a unique Christ is just; to say two hypostases, or (two) natures, which have been reunited, is not out of place, but is even logical in the matter." FROM THE SAME, from what he said against the fifth chapter<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup>: [THEODORET] "We call the Christ a theophoric man, not because he would have received only a partial divine grace, but as having the divinity of the Son entirely united to him."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">FROM THE IMPIOUS ANDREW, from what he said against the tenth chapter of the twelve chapters of Saint Cyril<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup>: "Indeed, the filiation, after the union of the two natures, is unique, since they are not separated from one another. For there is no separation which occurred after the union: the union is maintained eternally. That is indeed because, even in the sufferings of the flesh, the divinity was not apart, while remaining (itself) without suffering; and that which befits God was accomplished through the intermediary of the flesh. Also, we confess one unique Son and the same, the natures maintaining themselves without confusion, and we do not say him other and other, not at all, but unique and the same. There is therefore no one who does not confess this: our Lord Jesus-Christ became our pontiff and our apostle<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup>, according to the divine Scriptures, without the man who is (born) of the woman being separated from the Word who is issued from the Father, so that he who comes from the seed of David was united without confusion, in an inexplicable and inseparable manner, to the Word who is issued from the Father."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">See this spirit manifestly filled with satanic malice! Indeed, after having said that the filiation is unique in the two natures and showing by that that he recognized the union of the two natures only in the equality of the name of filiation and in the equality of dignity only, he then declares afterwards that, in his thought, there was no separation for the natures after the union; that the union remains, and that the union remains eternally, and that the divinity is not apart from the sufferings of the flesh, while remaining (itself) without sufferings, and that the Son is unique and the same, and not other and other, (behold what) says the wretch, by diluting the lie in dissimulation. From the two natures, he made two Christs! For he then added<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup>: [ANDREW] "So that he who comes from the seed of David is united without confusion, in an inexplicable and inseparable manner, to the Word who is issued from the Father." He is therefore without contradiction another person, he who comes from the seed of David, and another also, he who is issued from God the Father. How then would they not be two Christs and two sons? Or how does he who says he recognizes only one unique Son and the same, not lie? Unless eventually he expresses himself (thus), because the filiation is unique for the two natures. He believes therefore to make one unique Son from the filiation common to him who comes from the seed of David and to the Word issued from God the Father, separated (in reality) according to the natures and the hypostases! Logical with himself, elsewhere again, he indicates clearly that he calls conjunction of friendship the habitation of union. FROM THE SAME ANDREW, from the letter to Bishop Rabbula: "I say that there was a reunion of the human essence and of the divine (essence), and that the Monogenes issued from the Father united himself to him who comes from the seed of David, so that the natures are two, but that one knows (only one) person because of the conjunction (realized) in the temple, God the Word making use of the body." AND A LITTLE AFTER<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup>: [ANDREW] "For the divine Scripture proclaims to us the two, even after the union, and it says that God is, the same, also man, and form of God and form of the flesh, and Word and temple and inhabitant. If on the contrary we said only the God, without putting with him the man, or inversely the man, without putting with him he who is in him, we would absolutely deny this 'one'. Now, if we suppress the humanity, we commit an impiety equal to that of the Marcionites and the Manicheans, who say that it is in appearance and by false semblance, and not in truth, that Christ became man; if on the other hand in confessing the man, we do not also confess with him the divinity, we imitate the impiety of Photinus and of Paul (of Samosate) who say him an ordinary man, and who make profession, supposedly out of respect, of avoiding to confess two natures united. Always we 'suppress the 'one', and we say necessarily, either admirable diffusion and combination of the one with the other, or that God, transformed into the flesh, underwent and suffered all."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Here again that by saying two natures after the union, by confessing two natures united, and by calling the habitation union, he claims not to say, like Paul of Samosate, that Christ is an ordinary man. Now, Paul of Samosate himself said, in terms identical to those, that the Word dwells in a man: I allege his own testimonies. FROM THE IMPIOUS PAUL OF SAMOSATE, from the "Dialogue with Malchion"<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup>: "If wisdom makes the man great — as it does in fact make him great — it was not first lacking to him. Now it dwelt in this man, by perfecting him in all points, and it dwelt in him as never in any other person. Just as it was possible that the Incorporeal dwelt in a body — meaning in the whole man — thus it dwelt (in him) in such a way that he who comes from David, who was anointed, was not deprived of the Wisdom. And the Wisdom will not dwell to that degree in another." AND FURTHER ON<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup>: [PAUL OF SAMOSATE] "The unique Lord was in him in a principal capacity. For he was also in the [prophets], and especially in Moses. The Lord is also in many (men), but especially in the Christ, [as] in the temple of [God]."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Now, just as those who say two natures declare with falsehood that the habitation is a union — they begin by forming the man and thus make the Word issued from God the Father dwell in him, as we have first shown above — thus, in saying that it is from the very womb that the Word was united to the flesh which comes from Mary, they show that they express themselves by false semblance, seeing that they say it by founding (this union) on prescience, on the model of what God signified to Jeremiah by these words: "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you came forth from the womb I sanctified you."<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup> Now, just as those who say two natures declare with falsehood that the habitation is a union — they begin by forming the man and thus make the Word issued from God the Father dwell in him, as we have first shown above — thus, in saying that it is from the very womb that the Word was united to the flesh which comes from Mary, they show that they express themselves by false semblance, seeing that they say it by founding (this union) on prescience, on the model of what God signified to Jeremiah by these words: "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you came forth from the womb I sanctified you"<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup> and of what Paul also says: "But when God, who separated me from my mother's womb, willed to reveal his Son in me."<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup> And from then on it is progressively, partly after the baptism in the Jordan and partly also by an increase (resulting) from works, that were conferred upon him, they say, by donation and by increase, the wisdom and the gift which (emanate) from the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup>: "For the divinity was not a child either, but the divinity was with the child. It was with the child for the very reason that the child was not 'separated from the divinity', but that at the very voice of the angel, *the conjunction of God with the child (was effected at once that I am one)."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">FROM THE HERETICAL DIODORE<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup>: "He who comes from the seed of David, to whom it fell, from the moment of his formation, to be formed for the God Word, was of the God Word. Among us, indeed, the temple is first built, and then he who inhabits it enters; but in the womb of the Virgin, it is he who inhabited it, who himself formed the temple and he did not distance himself from the temple. He filled it with his glory and his wisdom, and this not as with the prophets, where there was ignorance until the Spirit made revelation (to them)." FROM THE SAME, ideas contrary to those, among other things<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup>: [DIODORE] "And he progressed in age and in wisdom. Now this cannot be said of the God Word, for he was begotten perfect God from the Perfect, Wisdom from the Wisdom, Power from the Power. He himself did not progress therefore, for he is not imperfect so as to grow in what is perfect, but what progressed in age and in wisdom was the flesh. The divinity did not, moreover, place its entire wisdom in it, from the moment it was made, but it conferred it progressively upon the body."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Afflicted with the same absence of spirit, the wretched Theodoret arrives at a similar contradiction of terms. FROM THEODORET, from what he said against the fifth chapter of Saint Cyril<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup>: "We call the Christ a theophoric man, not because he would have received only a partial divine grace, but as having the divinity of the Son entirely united to him." (And see) the contrary of these (assertions) in what was said against the fourth chapter<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup>: [THEODORET] "It is therefore not to the God Word that the ignorance belongs, but to the condition of a slave, which knew all things in time for as much as the divinity which inhabited it had revealed them to it." FROM THE SAME, from what he said against the tenth chapter<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup>: [THEODORET] "Who is he who, not perfect by nature, became perfect by virtuous works? Who is he who learned obedience in the trial<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup>, whereas he ignored it before the trial? Who is he who lived in piety, offered supplications with tears and could not save himself, but pressed him who could save him<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup> and asked him for deliverance from death? It is not the God Word, the Immortal, the Impassible, the Incorporeal, he whose remembrance is joy, according to the word of the prophet, and deliverance from tears, — for it is he who will wipe away the tears from all faces<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup>, and, says again the prophet: 'I remembered God and I rejoiced'<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup> — he who crowns those who live in piety, who knows all things before they happen<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup>, who possesses all that is of the Father<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup>, who is the unchangeable image of him who begot him<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup> and who shows in him the Father<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup>. But it is he who was assumed by him from the seed of David, he who is mortal, he who is passible, he who fears death, — even if afterwards he dissolved the power of death<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup>, thanks to the union with God who had assumed him, — he who walked in all justice and said to John: 'Allow it for the moment, for it is fitting that we thus accomplish entire justice'<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup>. It is this one who took the appellation of the supreme priesthood according to the order of Melchizedek<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup>, for it is he who was clothed with the weakness of nature, and not the God Word who is all-powerful. That is why the blessed Paul also wrote a little before: 'For we do not have a pontiff incapable of sympathizing with our weakness, but who has passed through all the same (trials) as we, except sin'<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup>. Now what passed through the test of our sufferings, except sin, is the nature which, for us, was taken from us and not he who took it for our redemption."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">What then is this language so contradictory? They say, on the one hand, that it is from the womb that the entire divinity of the Monogenes was united to what comes from Mary; they declare, on the other hand, that it is not from the beginning, while it was being formed, that the total wisdom was deposited in him, but that it is by growing in age that he was going, by receiving them, to acquire from his gifts, and following progress, virtuous works and a life of piety that he was going to obtain perfection! As for him, they are accustomed to call him "from the seed of David", "form of a slave" and "nature which was taken from us". What then is the explanation of such unconsciousness kneaded with inanity of spirit? We know it through the folly of Theodore of Mopsuestia. For they are worthy of being believed, when they explain their mutual perversity and resolve for us (their) mysterious enigmas, hidden under names of piety. It is by this, indeed, he says, that the God Word was united, from the very womb, to him who comes from Mary: by prescience only and by a benevolent complacency of the spirit, that in consequence it is little by little, in his progressive march toward virtue, that he was filled with wisdom and the Spirit. For they do not believe that the Word himself, who is the Wisdom and the Power of God, became flesh, that is to say that, while remaining himself immutable in what he was, he was hypostatically united to a flesh which came from the Virgin, endowed with a rational and intelligent soul, and that he is unique from the two, from the divinity and the humanity, that he is perfect in all and that in all he possesses perfection, and that, while the body was growing in age, he was making appear little by little his divinity in a measure which was proportioned to it. And that is why he is said to grow in wisdom and to be filled with the Spirit, and to dispense wisdom and the Holy Spirit to others.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">FROM THE IMPIOUS THEODORE OF MOPSUESTIA<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup>: "It is from the beginning, indeed, that he who was assumed was united to the God Word, receiving, by prescience, in the very formation in the womb, a beginning of union. But when he was rendered worthy of the (complete) union, he obtained all that it was possible for a man united to the Monogenes and to the Lord of the universe to acquire: he was, more than all the others, rendered worthy of great things, from the fact that the benefit of the union had already fallen to him. And he was also rendered worthy of the habitation of the Spirit, the first, more than all men and he was not rendered worthy of it in the manner of all the others. For he received in himself the total gift of the Spirit, whereas he conferred to others only a partial communion of the Spirit. Thus it came about that the entire Spirit acted in him." FROM THE SAME<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup>: [THEODORE] "When therefore they ask if Mary is mother of the man or mother of God, let us say both, the one (going) to the nature of the facts and the other to the state of exaltation: mother of the man, on the one hand, by nature, because there was, in the womb of Mary, a man who came out of it; mother of God, on the other hand, because God was in the man who was begotten, not limited in him according to his nature, but present in him by a complacency of the Spirit." FROM THE SAME<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup>: [THEODORE] "When Jesus was baptized, he came out immediately from the water. And behold for him the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descend from heaven and come upon him<sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup>. This, applied to the divinity, is not exact, since the Holy Spirit came upon him in the manner of a gift, — as also says the blessed Peter: 'Jesus of Nazareth, whom God anointed with the Holy Spirit and with Power'<sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup> — and also conferring upon him, by his support, what was lacking to him in the struggles (to be waged) against the Calumniator and in all the other (circumstances)." FROM THE SAME<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup>: [THEODORE] "For there was for him no emission of human seed, but he was formed by the operation of the divine Spirit. There was in him an inclination to all that tends to virtue, thanks to the union to the God Word, of which he had been rendered worthy by the intervention of the prescience of the God Word, when he united himself to him from on high. Thus therefore, for all these reasons, from the age of discretion he had a great hatred for evil, and, (the Word) joining himself to him by an [infinite] love according to the measure of his dispositions, he received again the aid which came to him from the God Word."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Here manifestly those who say the unique Christ is two natures and [pretend (?)] that the natures were united, declare that it is according to prescience and by a complacency of the spirit that the Word was united to a flesh. If they had, indeed, confessed the true and hypostatic union, they would not have said two natures after the union. For, if the union is true, the Christ is in no way two, but unique from two and a unique nature of the incarnate God Word. Here is the fact that they say (him) [two] after [the union] [...... ]<sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup> he was judged worthy of the anointing which (is effected) by the Spirit, to (be rendered) robust for the struggle with the Calumniator; that it is following progress and virtuous works that he held perfection, that the Word assists him with his directives. Since, indeed, they still confess two natures after they have been united, it is necessary that the union be only love and figure. For if they were truly united, they ceased to be two, and the Emmanuel is unique from two natures. That Theodore himself, who wrote these blasphemies, said that the Christ is two natures, we know by this citation. FROM THE IMPIOUS THEODORE<sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup>: "For the blessed Paul also expresses himself in these terms: 'From them is the Christ in the flesh, he who is God above all'<sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup>. It is not because he is from the Jews according to the flesh that he is God above all; but he says it to mark the human nature, the one which he knew to be of the race of Israel. As for that (which he says) to mark the divine nature, (namely) 'he who is above every thing and the universe', he knew that it is the Lord."</p>
