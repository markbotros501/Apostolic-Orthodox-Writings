    <h1>Refutation of the Comparison of the Chapters of the Synod and of Cyril</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Having therefore previously examined these (ideas) and uncovered all the deceit of their perverse cunning, I pass henceforth to the refutation of this calumny, urging those who listen to me solely to this: that they keep in memory what we have just developed previously, so that they may realize with evidence from what spirit is the author of this book, or rather of this snare of perdition. He cited certain texts of Saint Cyril, altering them entirely in the sense of his opinion,—he thinks they will thus support the dogma of impiety,—he voluntarily amputated others, all those which perfectly reflected the meaning of what was said and were of a nature to censure his cunning.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">We must now begin the exposition, by criticizing, and rightly so, the definition of those who assembled at Chalcedon, and who defined and declared that our unique Lord Jesus Christ is recognized in two natures, in the following manner.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">THE SYNOD AND CYRIL, CHAPTER 1</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[1] OF THE DEFINITION. CHAPTER ONE<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></span>: "One and the same Christ Jesus, our Lord, Monogenes, recognized in two natures, without confusion, without change, without separation and without division." After citing this chapter, the bad defender of the impious doctrines produces, to establish his own, as he believes, a text of SAINT CYRIL, from the first letter to Succensus, thus worded<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>: "Considering therefore, as I have said, the mode of the incarnation, we see that two natures have assembled with one another into an inseparable union, without confusion, without change. For the flesh is flesh and not divinity, although it became the flesh of God. In the same manner the Word also is God, and not flesh, although he made the flesh his own by the economy." After producing these (words) and suppressing those that come in the interval, he makes the following citation, suppressing other elements of these same words<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "WE say that there are two natures, but one Christ and Son and Lord, the Word of God who was incarnated and made man." What was omitted in the interval is precisely what makes the thought of Cyril appear in its integrity: he declares that, from the union of the two natures, the nature of the incarnate Word is unique, so that he is "from two natures" and not "in two natures", as the Chalcedonians defined the Emmanuel to be<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "When therefore we consider this, we do no harm to the concurrence of the one with the other, by saying that a union was made from the two natures. After the union we do not separate the natures from one another and we do not split into two sons the one who is unique and indivisible, but we declare one unique Son, as the Fathers have said: a unique nature of the incarnate God Word. Also, as far as one can perceive in thought and with the eyes of the soul alone the way in which the Monogenes became man, we say that there are two natures that were united, or, according to certain codices, we say that two natures were united, but that there is only one unique Christ, Lord and Son, the Word of God who was incarnated and made man. And if it is fitting, let us take as an example our composite which makes us men. Now we are composed of a soul and a body, and we see two natures, one, that of the body, the other, that of the soul, but, from the two, one unique man, thanks to the union. And the fact that we are composed of two natures does not make us think that the one who is unique is two men, but one man, as I have said, by the composition of soul and body. But if we suppress that the unique and only Christ is from two natures, and (from two natures) different, while being without division after the union, those who combat orthodoxy will say: If everything in him is only one nature, how did he become man and make the flesh his own?"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Here is clearly demonstrated that Saint Cyril said: From the union of the two natures, a unique nature, which is (that) of the Word, not however unincarnated, but incarnated. And he also added that we perceive only with the eyes of the soul in what way the Monogenes became man: we see two natures that were united, but, after having grasped the union by our spirit, we no longer say two, but one unique (nature) incarnated. For confessing "from two natures" gives birth to "one by composition". We consequently censure those who assembled at Chalcedon, because they rejected this "from two" and did not confess that Christ is "a unique nature of the incarnate God Word", likewise, because their admirable advocates, in bringing testimonies of Saint Cyril, suppress everywhere this "from two" as well as the attribution of a unique incarnate nature to the Word, as it was enunciated in what has just been cited. They amputate, indeed, quite similarly in what they allege, as not professed by the synod of Chalcedon, also this: the declaration that the Word was hypostatically united to a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Let no one among the simple be seduced, because those who assembled at Chalcedon confessed one Christ and Son, unique and the same, nor believe, for this reason, that they do not divide him! For it was the habit of those who are contaminated by the ideas of Nestorius to declare hypocritically one Son, unique and the same, by reason of the equality of the name of sonship or of community, but to confess two natures after the union. See what Andrew says in what he wrote in his critique of the tenth anathematism of Saint Cyril: "Indeed, the sonship after the union is (unique) in the two natures, since they are not separated from one another. For there is no separation that occurred after the union: the union maintains itself eternally. And in fact, even in the sufferings of the flesh, the divinity was not absent, while remaining (itself) without suffering; and what befits God was accomplished through the intermediary of the flesh. Also we confess him one unique and the same Son, the natures maintaining themselves without confusion, and we do not say other and other, not at all, but unique and the same." In the lying exposition he has made until now, he says, at the beginning, that the sonship is unique in the two natures, and he has revealed (by that) his thought: he considers the community of sonship as a union of natures; then, without danger henceforth, he added the sequel, as if he thought that, the two natures being posited, he confessed one unique and same Son and Christ,—like a man who fears that, for having expressed himself obscurely, there might be some who consider him as declaring in truth one unique Son! But he unveils the lie in the sequel of his text. For immediately after what has been cited, he says<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>: [ANDREW] "There is no one who does not confess this: that our Lord Jesus Christ became our pontiff and our apostle, according to the Scriptures, without the man who was born of the woman being separated from the Word who is from the Father, in such a way that he who comes from the seed of David was united without confusion, in an inexplicable and inseparable manner, to the Word who is from the Father." Other, therefore, is he who comes from the seed of David, apart from the Word issued from God the Father, and not the same. And how did he suddenly transform the natures into persons for us, the Word who comes from the Father and he who comes from the seed of David? The answer is ready: It is that they are united, and not separated, for, "in the two natures, the sonship is unique"! Thus, it is because of the unique appellation of sonship that the union exists, and not because the God Word was united hypostatically to a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul. If however you had recognized as unique and the same, he who is begotten of the Father according to divinity, but who, according to the flesh, comes from the seed of David, you would have known that the Word, who was incarnated for us, was also the Christ, and you would not have said that he was united to himself. For that is folly! Just as no one believes it right to say that every man is united to himself! For it is the elements from which the man is (constituted) that are united, and it is their union that makes one unique man. But once he has been made one, it is no longer accurate to say that he is united to himself. It is therefore clear that it is vainly and to deceive that those who assembled at Chalcedon make profession,—it is appearance,—of saying that the Christ and Son is unique and the same, while they declare two natures after the union, because they define the unique Christ in two natures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">THE SYNOD AND CYRIL, CHAPTER 2</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[2]</span> He cites again the second chapter of the definition. SECOND CHAPTER OF THE DEFINITION OF CHALCEDON, which is thus worded<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>: "...without the difference of the natures being suppressed because of the union." And to support it, he brings a chapter of SAINT CYRIL, from the second letter to Nestorius, thus conceived<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>: "...not as if the difference of the natures had been suppressed because of the union." And by this he thought to support that. If, he says, the natures are different, we will say the unique Christ (is) two natures, and not one unique (nature) incarnated. But here again we reproach him for having truncated the text. For it is by suppressing "from two" that he cited the testimony in this tenor. On the other hand, he also cut out: "The Word of God was united hypostatically to a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul". The reading presents itself thus<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "For we do not say that it is by undergoing a change that the nature of the God Word became flesh, nor that it was transformed into a whole man, of soul and body, but rather this: it is by uniting himself hypostatically to a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul, that the Word became man, in an inexplicable and incomprehensible manner. And he was called Son of Man, not only by desire or by will, nor yet by limiting himself to assuming a person, but because, if the natures which concurred together into a true union are different, the Christ and Son is one from the two; not that the difference of the natures was suppressed because of the union, but rather because they have formed for us one unique Lord, Christ and Son, from the divinity and the humanity, by an inexplicable and ineffable concurrence to unity."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">See how he said that it is from two, from the divinity and the humanity, that our Lord Jesus Christ is one and that the union did not suppress the difference of the natures, from which Christ is one. For the flesh remained flesh, and the God Word (remained) God, but, (if) the union did not suppress the difference of the natures, it suppressed their separation. For we do not make of the difference of the natures, from which Christ is one, a reason to say two natures after the union: the union, indeed, suppresses the duality. And it is not possible for the author of this book to say that this escaped him. Further down, indeed, among the chapters he cited and brought under a number, in the first chapter, he cited a part of this testimony that we have alleged, where the hypostatic union is mentioned<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>; and in the second, another part, in which it is said: "Christ, indeed, is one from the two<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>." But, suppressing the elements in question from the chapter that has just been cited, and detaching from it what comes in the interval, he cited: "...without the difference of the natures being suppressed because of the union", so that one might not blame those who assembled at Chalcedon for having abandoned the hypostatic union as well as the formula: "The Lord Jesus Christ is one from the two". For it is contrary to these expressions to define Christ in two natures. And as, also in the chapter cited above, where we censured him<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>, he detached a testimony from the first letter to Succensus and let fall elements that intervene in it, and in which Saint Cyril says "from two natures" and "a unique nature of the incarnate God Word", it is not through ignorance that he did it, but to avoid that, the sayings of Cyril being confronted with the points defined at Chalcedon and (their) appearing dissimilar, he might be recognized as guilty to his confusion. Further down, indeed, in the thirty-sixth and following chapters of the libel<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>, he dissociated the testimonies and, so to speak, cut them out with scissors; he (there) cites both "from two" and the formula "a unique nature, incarnated". And, in the fortieth chapter<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>, he again suppressed the formula "a unique (nature), incarnated"; elsewhere, in the fifty-first chapter, he cites a testimony drawn from the second letter to Succensus, which contains<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>: "We also say a unique nature of the Word and we necessarily add the term 'incarnated'." But, alongside that, he suppressed (in the document) many (passages) which censure the perverse astuteness of his heresy. This is what, with the help of God, we will make appear, when we establish its complete examination in its proper place in the exposition.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">THE SYNOD AND CYRIL, CHAPTER 3</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[3]</span> He cites again from the definition of the synod of Chalcedon a chapter thus conceived. THIRD CHAPTER OF THE DEFINITION<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>: "The property of each of the natures being rather safeguarded..." And he produced a chapter from the second letter OF SAINT CYRIL to Succensus, thus conceived<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>: "For, although we say unique the Monogenes, Son of God, who was incarnated and made man, it is not for that reason that he is the fruit of a confusion, as it seems to them. For neither did the nature of the Word pass into the nature of the flesh, nor that of the flesh (pass) into that of the Word. But each of them remaining and being known in the property inherent to its nature according to the exposition we have just made..." He therefore began by omitting the word "at the same time", since the text presents itself thus: "But each of them remaining at the same time and being conceived in the property inherent to its nature",—showing in all this that he does not accept the hypostatic union. This "at the same time", indeed, designates a real reunion of things that have assembled into one (being) unique. And after that he amputated the rest, which shows, by the citation of the statement itself, the confusion of the one who truncated it<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "But each remaining at the same time and being known in the property inherent to its nature, according to the exposition we have just given, the ineffable and inexplicable union has manifested to us a unique nature of the Son, but, as I have said, incarnated. For it is not only to those who are simple by nature that one rightly speaks of unity, but also to those who have been assembled by composition, such as this thing which is man, made of soul and body. For such elements, certainly, are different species and are unequal one to the other by essence; but once united, they make one unique nature of man, although, according to the reasons of the composite, there is a difference in the nature of the elements which met for the union. They are therefore empty things that those enunciate who say: If there is a unique nature of the incarnate Word, it follows necessarily that there is confusion and mixture, seeing that the nature of man has been diminished and frustrated. It has not, indeed, been diminished nor, as they say, frustrated. For it suffices, to signify perfectly the fact that he became man, to say that he was incarnated. Certainly, if we had passed that over in silence, there would have been some place for their calumnies; but since one adds it of all necessity, where is there, in some way, diminution or duping?"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Here it appears clearly that Saint Cyril recognizes the difference of the natures from which Christ (is constituted), that, on the other hand, he does not accept to say two natures after the union, but rather a unique nature of the incarnate God Word. Of what punishment is not therefore worthy the author of the libel who, like those who calumniate in the tribunals, has transformed certain firm and precise laws of the doctrine of the theophore Cyril, and has cut out parts of certain others which it was just to read in their entirety.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">THE SYNOD AND CYRIL, CHAPTER 4</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[4]</span> He cites again from the definition of the synod of Chalcedon a chapter thus conceived. FOURTH CHAPTER OF THE DEFINITION<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>: "And they concur between them to (form) one unique person and one unique hypostasis", we understand: the natures. And he then cites a testimony drawn FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the letter to John, which is thus conceived<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>: "...and as known in one unique person. For our Lord Jesus Christ is one, although one does not ignore the difference of the natures." Having cited the testimony only up to this point, he thinks, following his own design, that from the difference of the natures flow two natures after the union, whereas he suppressed what follows and makes known that from the two natures there is only one unique Christ. It is worded in these terms: "Although one does not ignore the difference of the natures, from which we say that the unity has been concluded."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">That by saying the unique Christ (is) two natures and yet his hypostasis and his person are unique, those who assembled at Chalcedon have sunk into the most senseless contradiction of terms, we demonstrate by the very words of Saint Cyril. For he who attributes one unique incarnate hypostasis and one unique person to the God Word, necessarily says one unique nature of the incarnate God Word. For what has been assembled from two (elements) whatever, has ceased, on the one hand, to be still "two", but remains "one" according to the composition: (if) it makes appear, without abandoning (anything), the elements from which it is (constituted), because they were fused without confusion, it remains "one" in a firm manner, and it can no longer be "two", because of the inseparable character of the union. FROM CYRIL, from the third letter to Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>: "The words of our Redeemer (found) in the gospel, we do not distribute them either between two hypostases nor between (two) persons. For the unique and only Christ is not double, although he who has been gathered into an indivisible unity is recognized as made of two different things; just as also man is recognized as made of soul and body and is not thereby double, but rather one, from the two." FROM THE SAME, from the same letter<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "Let us therefore attribute all the words (found) in the gospel to one unique person, to one unique hypostasis, to that of the Word, incarnated. For our Lord Jesus Christ is one according to the Scriptures<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>." FROM THE SAME, from the second book against the blasphemies of Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "Let all be expressed as coming from one unique person. For one recognizes that there is only one unique nature after the union, that of the Word itself, incarnated." AND FROM THE SAME AGAIN?: [CYRIL] "Cease to separate the natures after the union."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is therefore recognized by all this that (if) the union made the duality and the separation of the natures cease, it does not erase the difference of the natures, from which Christ is one. For the flesh remained flesh and the God Word (remained) God, while making his own the flesh which he had assumed and which he had hypostatically united to himself. For separation is one thing and difference is another, and there is as much distance from one to the other as SAINT CYRIL, in the Apology of the third anathematism against the critiques of Theodoret, says in these terms<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>: "It is exempt from all fault to recognize that the flesh, taken separately, is another nature, outside of the Word issued from the Father, and that the Monogenes is also another, according to the reason of his nature. But to recognize these things is not to separate the natures after the union." FROM THE SAME SAINT CYRIL, from the Apology of the eighth anathematism against the critiques of Andrew, where he demonstrates that Christ is a unique person, a unique hypostasis and a unique nature. For Andrew had criticized him for having declared in a writing that the Son sits beside the Father with his flesh, and for having said, in making the apology: Insofar as speaking of a unique person, of a unique nature and of a unique composed hypostasis, I have not erred in saying "with the flesh", for I have thus preserved for the one who is designated by this, to be unique according to the composition<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "For when, concerning a unique person and nature or a unique hypostasis, reason examines the elements from which it is constituted or is naturally composed, it resorts to the word 'with' or again to the word 'together'. It has thus preserved, for the one who is designated, to be unique according to the composition, and it does not divide him by separating him into two. When, on the contrary, the hypostases are first separated into two and must be recognized each apart, one says 'with' or 'together', but it is the word 'two', or 'several', we say, and not 'unique according to the composition', which gives the meaning. Thus, for example, if it happens to me to say that the soul of a man is honored with his body, in the case where some honor would be rendered to a unique man who is constituted from the two, or again if someone says that the soul is with its body only one unique living being, he in no way divides into two men the one who is one, but he appears rather not to ignore the (elements) from which he is constituted or is naturally composed. When he says, on the other hand, that Peter and John are together called men, or that John was going up with Peter to the temple, 'with' and 'together' no longer have the meaning of 'one single man'. For Peter did not enter into composition with John, and they do not form, the two of them, the constitution of one unique man. Why then do they set snares for the truth by dividing with ignorance into two the Christ who is one?" FROM THE SAME, from "The Christ is one" — the treatise is exposed in the form of a dialogue, by question and answer<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "I ask: The natures have therefore been confused and the two have become one? — Cyril: Who is he who is so senseless and ignorant as to believe either that the nature of the Word was transformed into what it was not, or that the flesh passed, following a mode of alteration, into that of the Word itself? For there is an impossibility there. We say therefore that the Son is one, that his nature is one, although he is recognized as having 'become', by taking a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul. For the humanity, as I have said, became his and we recognize him only in this manner: both God and man..." AND A LITTLE LATER<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "O our friend, it is therefore rather extravagances that he pronounces who has said that there occurs a confusion or a mixture, if we profess that the Lord is a unique nature, incarnated and made man. For it is impossible for anyone to prove it by compelling and solid reasonings. And if they fix their own will as law for us, they have conceived a design which they will not be able to sustain. For we attach ourselves preferably, not to them, but to the inspired Scripture. If they think, moreover, that the nature of man, because it is nothing beside the divine greatness, has been frustrated and absorbed (by it), as they say, once again we say: 'You err, because you ignore the Scriptures as well as the power of God'<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>. For it was not impossible for the merciful God to show himself enduring the human conditions himself. And it is this that he indicated to us in advance, in a figurative manner, by instructing Moses and by describing, under a form of images still, the mode of the inhumanation. He descended, indeed, upon a bush in the desert under the appearance of fire; and the fire shone upon that plant of modest size, which however was not consumed<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>. Moses was struck with stupor at these visions. For how was the wood not ill-chosen (as a support) for the fire? How did a matter easily inflammable resist the violence of the flame? It is that the fact was, as I have said, the symbol of the mystery which made appear the divine nature of the Word enduring the conditions of humanity, when he would wish it; for there is absolutely nothing that he cannot (realize)! — I ask: You knew well that they do not accept to nourish thoughts that concord (with those)! — Cyril: Behold him therefore taken in flagrant delict, and without contestation, their discourse which professes two sons and two Christs."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Behold that he declares clearly that those who do not confess that the nature of the incarnate Son is unique, but rather two, confess without contradiction two sons and two Christs. Now (on this point), to say the Christ is two natures comes down to saying two sons, hear Nestorius who expresses himself in this manner. FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>: "It is the Son of God, indeed, that the Virgin, mother of Christ, gave birth to. But since the Son of God is double according to the natures, she did not give birth to the Son of God, but she gave birth to the humanity, which is son because of the one who is joined to it." AND IN ANOTHER DISCOURSE STILL, he says<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>: [NESTORIUS] "Two natures, a unique filiation! Why do you calumniate the Word?" Perhaps someone will say that the Chalcedonians have said: "in an indivisible and without separation manner"? But Nestorius says it too! FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS, from the discourse entitled: "Of the divine inhumanation"; it was pronounced, while another had spoken before him, because the crowd had constrained him to it<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>: "Let one confess what belongs to the natures and let one not dissociate what pertains to the dignity of the natures, for there is no separation of dignity in the natures. And the things now accomplished by the divinity are not others, nor others also those (accomplished) by the body; for there is only a unique domination over all, proper to the two, a unique resurrection of the dead (effected) by the two, a unique knowledge of all the spirits that are in the angels, men, and demons, (emanating) from the two: the foreknowledge of the divinity is not other, nor other that of the humanity. In all this, indeed, there is for the divinity no separation in relation to the flesh."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Behold that Nestorius also confesses that the natures are not separated, but it is (only) according to the dignity. For if he said that the natures were hypostatically united, he would not declare, neither he nor those who assembled at Chalcedon, two natures after the union, but a unique nature of the God Word incarnated; and saint Cyril, unveiling their lie, in the second letter to Succensus, declared it in the following manner. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the second letter to Succensus<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>: "For the expression 'without separation' is taken among them, following the vain terminology of Nestorius, in another sense. They say indeed that it is following the equality of dignity, and because the will is the same, and by the power that the man in whom he dwelt was not separated from the Word. Also it is not without detours that they pronounce these words, but with ruse and a perverse astuteness."</p>

        <p class="subheading">THE SYNOD AND CYRIL, CHAPTER 5</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[5]</span> He cites again from the definition of those who assembled at Chalcedon a chapter thus conceived. CHAPTER FIVE OF THE DEFINITION<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>: "...not divided or split into two persons, but one unique and same Son, Monogenes, the God Word and our Lord Jesus-Christ." And he produces a chapter FROM CYRIL, from the second letter to Succensus thus conceived<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>: "...not that he is divided for this reason into two persons and into (two) sons, but he remained unique and the same, our Lord Jesus-Christ." If however, following Cyril, you had confessed a unique person, a unique Son and a unique Christ, and if you had not divided him into two, you would have said that the nature of the God Word incarnated is unique, and thus, in all justice, you would have confessed with us, in truth and not fraudulently, that the unique Christ and Son is a unique person. For here also, after having detached a testimony from the texts enunciated above, you cited it, mutilated at your will. Now the testimony, in its integrity, is thus conceived<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "It has therefore escaped those who put confusion into what is exact, that the nature of the God Word incarnated is in truth unique. For the Son, the Word who is naturally and truly born of the Father in an ineffable manner, is unique; and when, assuming a flesh, not deprived of a soul, but rather endowed with an intelligent soul, he came forth, man, from the woman, he has not, for this motive, been divided into two persons, into (two) sons, but he remained unique." If therefore the synod of Chalcedon, — as you bring it in by doing violence to it! — had known how to follow saint Cyril, it would have begun by confessing that the nature of the God Word incarnated is unique, and thus, logically, it would have added that the Christ, the Son and the incarnate Word, is unique, and that he is not divided into two persons. Besides the fact that you have mutilated the testimony, you have also transformed and falsified what you cited. You, indeed, have cited it in this manner: "He remained unique and the same, our Lord Jesus-Christ". Now the authentic writing is thus conceived: [CYRIL] "He remained unique, not however deprived of flesh nor outside of the body, but (this one) is his own by an indivisible union." Thus therefore, by cutting off these words of saint Cyril, where he proclaims clearly a unique nature of the God Word incarnated, you have made it understood that it was not following the thought of Cyril that the synod of Chalcedon had confessed that the Christ is a unique person, but that, defining the Christ in two natures, it is in the line of the astute and vain terminology of Nestorius that it had said the person "without division nor separation".</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now, that Nestorius also, in confessing two natures, only apparently does not divide into two persons, we make clearly evident by what follows. FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS, concerning the word: "It is not of my own accord that I have spoken, but the Father, who has sent me, has prescribed to me himself what I must say and what I must express<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>."<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>: "...the person of the Son of God not being divided into two, according to the blasphemy that some impute to us. For the Son is unique, the Christ is unique but the natures are two; according to the filiation the person is unique, the filiation is unique, but the natures are two, as I have said."<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup>: [NESTORIUS] "One must not call Son either the God Word taken separately, nor also the humanity taken separately, for that would be nothing else than to establish two sons. But the name of filiation has become common to the two natures. You have said the Son? You have indicated the two natures. You have said the Christ? You have separated none of the natures in the filiation."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">One has already understood, consequently, that it is because of the equality of the name of filiation, that those who are contaminated by Dyophysitism say, in a lying manner, a unique person. FROM THE IMPIOUS THEODORET, from the (assertions) conforming to those, drawn from the critique of the third chapter of saint Cyril<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup>: "To confess similarly a unique person, (one) Son and (one) Christ is just; to declare that the two hypostases or natures have been reunited is not out of place but is logical in the matter." FROM THE SAME; from the letter that he wrote, taking the defense of the definition of those who are assembled at Chalcedon against the accusation of John of Aegae, where Theodoret shows that the synod understood the unique hypostasis for the person<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup>, following the vain statements of Nestorius that we have just cited<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup>: [THEODORET] "One recognizes therefore that those who have mentioned the two natures and the union without confusion, understand also that the unique hypostasis is not the essence nor the nature, but the person." AND FURTHER ON<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup>: [THEODORET] "That is why the holy synod has posed a unique hypostasis, not understanding, as I have said, that the hypostasis is the nature, but rather the person. For it is this that the symbol itself makes understood: to the person is joined the hypostasis!"</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Who is it, therefore, who would not be astonished at this ruse with multiple faces and would not flee, like the bites of snakes ejecting their venom, the doctrines contaminated by these seducers? Behold, indeed, that Theodoret, the president of this admirable synod, who knows its design like no one else, declares that it took the unique hypostasis for the unique person. How therefore would considerable vigilance and a great number of eyes not be needed, if one can say, to preserve oneself from such lies and from the snares of a perverse opinion?</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">THE SYNOD AND CYRIL, CHAPTER 6-7</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[6]</span> He cites again another chapter from the elements of those who assembled at Chalcedon, thus known. CHAPTER SIX OF THE DEFINITION<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup>: "In conformity with what formerly the prophets have said concerning him and that Jesus-Christ himself has taught, and that the symbol of the Fathers has transmitted to us." And to confirm this, he brings a chapter FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the second letter to Nestorius, thus conceived<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup>: "It does not suffice for him who introduces some heresy to say that he has a profession conforming to the Fathers." * Note: it does not suffice to him who introduces some heresy to say that he has a profession conforming to the Fathers<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup> * "Thus we find what the holy Fathers think." It would be vain and senseless to expand further on this subject. For every heresy, so to speak, professes that it has an opinion conforming to the divine Scriptures and to the tradition of the Fathers, while altering at its will all that has been excellently expressed by them. It is for that therefore that in the third letter that he addressed to him, SAINT CYRIL wrote in these terms to Nestorius, who said he had a faith conforming to the symbol of the 318 Fathers<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup>: "But it does not suffice for your Chastity to limit yourself to professing with us the symbol of the faith, which was formerly composed in the Holy-Spirit by the great and holy synod assembled formerly at Nicaea. For you have understood and interpreted it not in an obvious manner, but rather a diverted one, even if by voice you profess its very tenor." If therefore the author of this libel wanted to demonstrate that those who assembled at Chalcedon understood the symbol in the manner of Cyril, it was necessary that he not truncate the texts of Cyril, on the occasion of all the chapters that they composed. But it is because he knew perfectly well that what was professed by them is contrary to the thought of the saint, that he arrived at this impudent calumny.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[7]</span> CHAPTER SEVEN OF THE DEFINITION<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup>: "It is for this that, these (dispositions) being fixed in every point by us with all the diligence and all the desired precision, the holy and ecumenical synod has defined that it was not permitted to anyone to present, or to write, or to compose, or to understand, or to teach otherwise; those who dare either to compose another faith, or again to present, or to teach or to transmit another symbol to those who want to turn towards the knowledge of the truth (coming) from paganism and Judaism or from any heresy whatsoever, those, if they are bishops or clerics, let them be set aside, the bishops from the episcopate and the clerics from the clericature, and if they are monks or laity, let them be anathema!" And he produces A CANON OF THE SYNOD OF EPHESUS, — which was presided over by saint Cyril and which deposed the impious Nestorius, — which is thus conceived<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup>: "Therefore, after this reading, the holy synod stipulated this: it is not permitted to anyone to present, or to write or to propose another faith outside of that which was defined by the holy Fathers assembled at Nicaea with the Holy-Spirit; as for those who dare either to compose or to present or to show another faith to those who want to turn towards the knowledge of the truth (coming) from paganism or Judaism or from any heresy whatsoever, those, if they are bishops or clerics, let them be set aside, the bishops from the episcopate and the clerics from the clericature, and if they are laity, let them be anathema!"</p>

        <p class="paragraph">This man exercised in ruse made these citations, because he wanted to destroy the accusation (that weighed) on the synod of Chalcedon. It is with just reason that (its members) are accused of having defined another faith, on the margin of the canon of the holy Fathers, and of having altered the holy and apostolic symbol by foreign additions. When, putting them face to face, we examine what was said by them and by those who assembled at Ephesus, it is possible to see clearly by the very terms, the mode of innovation (presented by their) decree. At Ephesus, indeed, a certain priest Charisius, who was from Philadelphia, — this is a city of Lydia, — presented to the holy synod a corrupted symbol of faith, thanks to which the table-companions of Nestorius had seduced many Lydians. — Their names are cited in the acts (of the synod) because they have recused the impious error of this same falsified symbol, this one coming from Theodore of Mopsuestia<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup>. Saint Cyril has declared himself in the letter to the venerable Proclus, bishop of Constantinople<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup>, that in writing things similar to this illegitimate symbol, Theodore had, by these words, uttered a blasphemy. And in the treatise against Diodore and Theodore also<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup>: as he had, here, permitted the reading and the holy synod had been moved before the blasphemy, he pronounced, from the very reading, the following definition<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup>: [From the synod of Ephesus] "After this reading, the holy synod defines therefore this: it is not permitted to anyone to present, to write or to compose another faith outside of that which was defined by the holy Fathers assembled at Nicaea with the Holy-Spirit." Now the synod of Chalcedon (did not proceed) in this manner. But because (its members) knew perfectly well that they had defined a decree that innovated, that they had added what they wanted, in defining our unique Lord Jesus-Christ in two natures, and that they had accommodated their definition to the impious letter of Leo, calling this one the column of the true faith, as being in the line of the confession of the apostle Peter, they have thus declared<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup>: [From the synod of Chalcedon] "It is for this that, these (dispositions) being fixed in every point by us with all the precision and all the desired diligence, this holy and ecumenical synod has defined that it was not permitted to anyone to present or to write or to compose another faith."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Behold that they have clearly shown that it was themselves who had defined. Those of Ephesus had therefore declared that it was not permitted to anyone to propose another faith outside of what had been defined by the holy Fathers assembled at Nicaea. These, on the contrary, after having begun, uniquely to deceive the simple, by citing the faith of the 318, defined in the interval what they wanted, and they said afterwards that it was not permitted to anyone to present another symbol on the margin of what had been defined by them. Now, it is without having defined anything at all, nor having said anything in dogmatic matter, that those of Ephesus introduced, against the symbol delivered by Charisius, a canon stipulating that one must not define another faith: the acts (of the synod) bear witness to it; it is moreover what the very words that they introduced into the canon also make understood. FROM THOSE OF EPHESUS<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup>: "In an equal manner, if certain ones, whether bishops, or priests, or laity, are incriminated either of thinking or of teaching the (ideas contained) in this symbol delivered by the priest Charisius concerning the inhumanation of the Monogenes, Son of God, or again the corrupted and perverse doctrines of Nestorius, which are equally cited below, let them fall under the blow of the sentence of this holy and ecumenical synod, in such a way that this be known: the bishop will be deprived of the episcopate and will be deposed, the cleric will be similarly stripped of the clericature, and if it were a layman, he also will be anathema, as has been said above." What was defined at Ephesus has therefore nothing in common with what was added at Chalcedon, as has been demonstrated with precision by the cited passages.</p>
