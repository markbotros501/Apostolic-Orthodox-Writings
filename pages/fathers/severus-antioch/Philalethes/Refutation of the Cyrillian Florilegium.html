    <h1>Refutation of the Cyrillian Florilegium</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Up to this point extend the chapters that this sacrilegious plunderer of the inspired words of Cyril has cited at the beginning of the libel, for the defense of those who assembled at Chalcedon. We pass henceforth to those that remain and that he cited under an order number, first inscribing an initial title that is proper to him and that reveals the impious design of his thought. His text, in the initial title, is formulated thus: INITIAL TITLE<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>: "From Cyril, Archbishop of Alexandria, various testimonies in which one can find the difference of the two natures and that the God Word is proclaimed by him impassible and immortal, the temple, on the contrary, passible and mortal."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Here is the critique. If you had the intention of making the apology of the synod of Chalcedon, the initial title should have included a declaration of this kind: that Saint Cyril said two natures after the union, defining our unique Lord Jesus Christ in two natures. It is not, in fact, because he recognizes the natures, from which the Emmanuel is constituted, as different, that from that very moment, according to your statement, he also divides the one who is one into two natures, so that the temple, as you said, is recognized separately as mortal, and the God Word, apart from him, separately as immortal, so that the mortal is other and the immortal is other, the passible is other and the impassible is other.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But it is not thus that the God-bearing doctors of the Church thought; they recognize on the contrary the same as impassible and the same as passible. Indeed, although the Word was impassible according to his nature, the suffering nevertheless became his, because the passible body was proper to him, to which he was hypostatically united. Do not take, therefore, the difference of the natures, from which Christ is one, for a separation. For it is one thing to say two and, in this sense, to separate, and another thing to recognize the difference of the elements from which the one has been assembled. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the apology of the third anathematism against the critiques of Theodoret<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>: "It is exempt from all fault to recognize eventually that the flesh, according to its nature, is other, outside of the Word issued from the Father, and that the Monogenes is also other, according to the reason of its nature. But to recognize these things is not to separate the natures after the union." FROM THE SAME, from the second book against the blasphemies of Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "For that between the divinity and the humanity there is a considerable difference and distance, I personally also grant. For the things named are other from the angle of 'how are they' and appear, rightly, in nothing similar one to the other. But when the mystery of Christ presents itself to us, the reason of the union does not ignore the difference, but excludes the separation: not that it confuses or mixes the natures one with the other, but because, the Word of God having participated in the flesh and blood<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, the Son, even in this state, is still recognized and called unique." FROM THE SAME, from the fifth book against the blasphemies of Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "WE say therefore that the Word, who is issued from the God Father, willed to suffer for us in the flesh, conforming to the sayings<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>. Thus saint Paul has taught and declared it to us." AND FURTHER ON<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "For we confess that the Word, who is issued from the God Father, is one unique Christ, Son and Lord of glory, who made himself man for us and suffered for us in the flesh, according to the Scriptures<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>." AND FURTHER ON<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "Indeed, when the person of the Emmanuel comes (into question) and is submitted to debate, even if we declare him a man, we understand that the Word issued from the God Father took the form of a slave<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> and we say he is known from the measures of the deprivation; if on the other hand (we declare him) God, Monogenes, we believe that it is the same, (but) incarnate henceforth and made man." FROM THE SAME, from the third letter to Nestorius; twelfth anathematism<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "Whoever does not confess that the Son of God suffered in the flesh, was crucified in the flesh, tasted death in the flesh and became the First-born from the dead, from the fact that he is life and life-giver, as God, let him be anathema!" FROM THE SAME, from the apology of the same anathematism against the critiques of Theodoret<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "But since the salvation of the world depended on his suffering, and since on the other hand it was impossible that the Word who is issued from the Father suffered in his own nature, he wisely disposed the work of the economy. He appropriated, indeed, a body capable of suffering so that it might be said that he suffered in that which is naturally apt to suffer, while remaining himself impassible in his own nature. Given that he suffered voluntarily in the flesh<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>, he is and is called for that very reason the Savior of all. For, as Paul said: 'By the grace of God, he tasted death for us all<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>.'"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, does it seem to you that he thereby distances the God Word from the suffering? Or rather that he says the suffering is his, although he was impassible according to his nature, as God, because he was united to a body naturally apt to suffer? How then do you remove him from the suffering, by (him) dividing with ignorance in this wise initial title which is yours and where you declare: The God Word is proclaimed by Cyril impassible and immortal, the temple on the contrary passible and mortal, in such a way that, following the blasphemies of Nestorius, it is said that he who suffered is other and he who did not suffer is other? FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS, what is similar to the initial title<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>: "Henceforth, he who suffered is the merciful pontiff, but it is the temple that is passible and not God, the life-giver of him who suffered."</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">DISCUSSION OF THE CHAPTERS</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">1. FIRST CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> From the second letter to Nestorius, of which here is the beginning: "There are, as I learn, some who cry out against my opinion..."<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> [CYRIL] "For we do not say that it is by undergoing a change that the nature of the Word became flesh, nor that it was transformed into a complete man, of soul and body. Rather we say this: it is by uniting himself hypostatically to a flesh endowed with a rational soul that the Word became man in an inexplicable and incomprehensible manner."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — It appears to me superfluous to extend the discussion vainly on this point. For we too do not say that the God Word was transformed into a body or into a man, of soul and body; but we confess that, while remaining entirely what he was, he was hypostatically united to a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul. Show therefore that, in the definition, it is this very thing that the synod of Chalcedon professed. This is what we criticized them for in the chapters cited above. If they had, indeed, confessed the hypostatic union, they would have also said that the nature of the incarnate God Word is unique, and they would not have dissolved, on their own initiative, the union, by defining that the unique Christ is in two natures.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">2. SECOND CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the same letter<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>: "The natures which concurred together into a true union are different, but they are only one unique Christ and Son from the two, without the difference of the natures having been suppressed because of the union."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — I do not know if, by citing these (words), you were entering into conflict with us or with yourself. Indeed, as if you had truly proposed to indicate what this admirable synod had plundered, you now bring us into the debate these words in their integrity, whereas you have insidiously truncated those chapters that were examined a little earlier, when the words of the definition of the synod and those of Cyril were confronted with one another. Besides, there also we reproached you for having suppressed the expression "one unique Christ and Son from the two". But it was to avoid the ridicule that would result from the examination of these words brought together, their opposition being obvious to the eyes, that you voluntarily camouflaged the truth. Indeed, what is "from two" is not dissociated so as to become again two, but it marks one unique thing, which has been assembled from different realities into an indivisible unity. And on this point also accept me as a witness the word of the same Cyril. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the first letter to Succensus<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>: "When therefore we consider that, we do no harm to the concurrence of the one with the other into a unity, which we say was made from two natures. But after the union we do not separate the natures from one another and we do not divide into two sons the one who is unique and indivisible, but we declare one unique Son and, as the Fathers have said, one unique nature of the incarnate God Word."</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">3. THIRD CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the same letter to Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>: "For it is both vain and ignorant to say that he who preexists to all the ages and is coeternal to the Father, had need of a second beginning to be."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — Among those who say that one must confess one unique nature of the incarnate God Word, who then has been contaminated by this shameful and tortuous doctrine? Cyril, indeed, who declared that the God Word did not have need of a second beginning to be, also proclaims that one must confess one unique nature of the Word, but, as I have said, incarnate. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the second book against the blasphemies of Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>: "Let all be said as coming from one unique person. For one recognizes that there is only one nature after the union, that of the Word itself, incarnate."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">On the other hand, it is the moment to tell you, regarding the clumsy and inopportune citation of the chapter, the holy words of Cyril refuting and unveiling the ignorant calumny of Nestorius. For it is from this stock that your (bad) shoots have come out. FROM THE SAME SAINT CYRIL, from the first book against the blasphemies of Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>: "It necessarily results from (their) discussion how profound, astute and inextricable is the sense of the thoughts of him who wrote this passage for us. Where do these fables that you have assembled come from to present yourself to the debate? Or, in a word, who has sunk into such an ineptitude of thoughts that he believes and says that the divinity of the Monogenes does not hold from the Father its existence which precedes the ages, but that it has rather taken the flesh and blood as the beginning of its passage to being? Who is so unreasonable, poor in spirit and totally rebellious to the Holy Scriptures? Who does not remember that Isaiah cried out concerning him: 'Who will recount his generation?'<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> And John wrote clearly: 'In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. All things were made by him and without him nothing was made'<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>. Now, if all (was made) by him, how would he who is before all the ages and times be more recent in existence than those who were made by him? Why then do you introduce as being declared, what is (in reality) rejected by all? Cease to calumniate those who with good reason take issue with these ideas that are yours and mock the extent of the ignorance that they imply."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Here then is what Saint Cyril declares: that the nature of the incarnate God Word is unique and that he confesses in no way that the divinity of the Monogenes drew from Mary its passage to being. As for you, if you think, to escape, to substitute this confession: that one must say two natures after the union, do not use the testimonies of Cyril by half! Although he recognizes, indeed, that the existence of the God Word is anterior to the ages, he does not deprive him of the birth according to the flesh which comes from the Virgin, seeing that he says he was born of her according to the flesh. But your ideas rely on the inanity of the shameful words of Nestorius, who also speaks in this manner. FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>: "For the Virgin, mother of Christ, also gave birth to the Son of God. However, as the Son of God is double according to the natures, she did not give birth to the Son of God, but she gave birth to the humanity, which is son because of the Son who is joined to him." AND AGAIN<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>: [NESTORIUS] "For God, it is said, sent his Son; he became of a woman, he became subject to the Law<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>. In this place (Paul) designates two natures and attributes to the humanity what has occurred. Otherwise, ask the one who contests: Who became subject to the Law? The God Word?"</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">4. FOURTH CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the same letter to Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>: "Not, indeed, that an ordinary man began by being born of the Holy Virgin, and that then the Word descended upon him; but, united from the very womb, he is said to have undergone the carnal birth, making his own the birth of his own flesh. It is thus that we say both that he suffered and that he rose again: not that the God Word would have undergone in his own nature the wounds, the perforations of the nails or again the other injuries, — for the divinity is impassible and incorporeal, — but because the body, which became his, suffered all that, he is said in turn, himself, to have suffered for us. The Impassible, indeed, was in a body that suffered. It is in a same and equal manner that we also understand the fact that he died. Indeed, the God Word is by nature immortal, incorruptible, living and life-giving. But since, once again, his own body, by the grace of God, as Paul said, tasted death for all<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>, he is said to have himself undergone death for us: not that he would have come to experience death in what concerns his own nature, — that would be folly, indeed, to say such a thing! — but because, as I said a moment ago, his flesh tasted death. Thus also, his flesh once resurrected, it is to him that the resurrection is attributed: not that he would have fallen himself into corruption, not at all! but because, once again, it is his own body that is resurrected. And it is thus that we will confess that he is one unique Christ and Lord."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — This wise man therefore thinks that Saint Cyril, by these words, separates from the God Word the body that suffered, and from there comes the idea of the division! It is because he is ignorant that the thought and the dialectic (of Cyril) escape him. Indeed, after having first, in another part of the letter, cited these words<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "It is by uniting himself hypostatically to a flesh endowed with a rational soul, that the Word became man in an inexplicable and incomprehensible manner", he declares without danger that the body underwent the wounds, the perforations of the nails and also the trial of death, knowing perfectly well that (the Word) was, he, impassible according to his nature and one hypostatically with the body that suffered, that he himself, because of the union, attributed death to himself as his own, but that he did not suffer damage coming from the sufferings, because of the impassibility of the divine nature. He has not, indeed, as does the impious Tome OF LEO, confirmed by the synod of Chalcedon, divided with impiety the unique Christ into two natures, introducing (his) exposition in the form of an interrogation by these words<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>: [LEO] "What nature underwent the nails and was suspended on the wood of the cross?" Accept me again Saint Cyril as interpreter of his own thought. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the fifth book against the blasphemies of Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>: "One must not, indeed, that he presents himself bitter and harsh to the debate by saying: Was the God Word seized? Was the nature of the divinity victim of a murder? That he has not expressed such a thing by virtue of a precise science, you will understand, and very easily, by this. The holy martyrs, we say, consumed their life with the will to endure all, so that, after having fought the good fight, finished their course and preserved their faith, they might weave a crown of friendship in Christ<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>. Thus therefore, suppose that someone comes to pose the following question: While the bodies of the saints were lacerated by iron weapons and consumed by fire, or when, at the beginning, they were enchained, were the souls also mastered with the bodies? Did they also become the prey of fire and the sword? And since we say that they suffer nothing in their own nature, from the fact that they escape such bodily sufferings, is it therefore for that, tell me, that they do not have their part in the crowns, because they did not suffer the evils of the body? But the expression of the truth does not place them outside of the suffering. It is, indeed, their bodies, and not (the bodies) of other (souls), that suffered. It is therefore ignorance to take pleasure in asking if the nature of the divinity was delivered with the flesh, or if it was mastered by the bonds of the Jews, or if it underwent the immolation itself. It is rather just to think that the God Word makes his own, in all and without reserve, the sufferings that occurred in the flesh, but that he remained impassible, as God, without however being outside of the body that suffered. But (Nestorius), he, rejecting by his misplaced critique what was realized according to the economy, declares in all senses that one must not say that the nature of the divinity underwent the immolation, makes with impiety rest on the man alone the virtue of the mystery and declares that it is he who was crucified and who underwent death for the life of the world." AND FURTHER ON<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "Thus therefore, he abandoned the body to the laws of its nature and he accepted to taste death, the Word who was united to him permitting it opportunely that he should undergo this (fate). It is indeed by divine virtue that he was alive, (by the virtue) of the Word who was hypostatically united to him. We therefore understand Emmanuel — whose translation is: God with us — in his integrity, when we hear the divine Peter declare: 'This Jesus, God has raised up'<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>. Even if you say visible and attached to the cross the one whom Thomas touched with his hands, we nonetheless understand him as the Word issued from God who became incarnate and we profess one unique Son and the same. For although being invisible according to his nature, he became visible, since the body that was seen was his. Thus the divine David sings for us: 'God will come visibly, our God, and he will not keep silence'<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>. And for his part, the blessed Habakkuk: 'God will come from the South, and the Holy One from the mountain of thick shade'<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup>. This one, although being non-palpable, is said to have become palpable, because of the body that was united to him." It is therefore recognized from what has been said that, once the hypostatic union has been professed beforehand, even if one says that it is the body that suffered, one does not remove the Word from the suffering, who was hypostatically united to the passible body, while remaining impassible in his own nature.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[5-7.]</span> So much for the apology annexed to the fourth chapter of the adversary. For the fifth, sixth and seventh chapters of this miserable libel, it is superfluous to prolong the discussion, because their commentary is found in what we have examined previously: we do not say that the God Word was transformed into flesh, nor that the flesh passed into the nature of the Word himself, nor that the God Word, creator of the ages and times, drew from Mary, as he is God, the principle of his passage into being, although he had become of the woman according to the flesh, that he had become under the Law<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> as Holy Scripture says. Our wise dispenser of his chapters therefore believes that there are two natures after the union, because the natures, from which (is constituted) Emmanuel, have not been transformed. It is fitting therefore, since he closes the ear of his spirit, that we cite to him incessantly the words of Cyril, so that he may evidently conclude that it is not necessary that the elements from which (is constituted) Christ transform themselves, if we confess one unique nature of the incarnate God Word.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the second letter to Succensus<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>: "For, although we say unique the Monogenes, Son of God, who became incarnate and made man, it is not for that reason that he is the fruit of a confusion, as it seems to them. For neither did the nature of the Word pass into the nature of the flesh, nor that of the flesh (pass) into that of the Word. But each of them remaining and being recognized in the property inherent to its nature, according to the exposition we have just given, the ineffable and inexplicable union has manifested to us one unique nature of the Son, but, as I have said, incarnate. For one speaks rightly of unity not only concerning those who are simple by nature, but also concerning those who have been assembled by composition, as is the case for man, made of soul and body. For such elements, certainly, are of different species and are unequal one to the other by essence; but once united, they make one unique nature of man, although, according to the (specific) reasons of the composite, there is a difference in the nature of the elements that have come to union. They are therefore vain things that those enunciate who say: if there is one unique nature of the incarnate Word, it necessarily follows that there is confusion and mixture, seeing that the nature of man has been diminished and frustrated. It has been, in fact, neither diminished nor, as they say, frustrated. For it suffices, to signify perfectly the fact that he became man, to say 'incarnate'. Certainly, if we had passed that over in silence, there would have been room for their calumny; but since one adds it of all necessity, where is there, in some way, diminution or deception?"</p>
    </div>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">8. EIGHTH CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the letter to John, Archbishop of Antioch, of which here is the beginning: 'Let the heavens rejoice and let the earth leap for joy'<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup> — 'We confess therefore our Lord Jesus-Christ, the Son of God, Monogenes, perfect God and perfect man, of a rational soul and a body; born of the Father before the ages according to divinity; and in the last days, the same, for us and for our salvation, of the Virgin Mary according to humanity; consubstantial to the Father according to divinity. There was, in fact, union of the two natures. For this reason, we confess one unique Christ, one unique Son and one unique Lord. Conformably to this conception of the union without confusion, we confess that the Holy Virgin is Mother of God, because the God Word became incarnate and made man and, from the very conception, united to himself the temple that was taken from her. As for the evangelical and apostolic words relating to the Lord, we know that the theologians make some common, as (relative) to one person, but distinguish among the others, as (relative) to the two natures: those that befit God, they attribute to the divinity of Christ, and those that are relative to the state of humiliation, to his humanity. Finding among you these holy words and finding ourselves thinking in the same manner — for there is but one Lord, one faith, one baptism<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup> — we have glorified God, our Savior of all, rejoicing together that the Churches among you and among us have a faith conforming to the inspired Scriptures and to the tradition of our holy Fathers.'</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY — When the holy synod was assembled in the metropolis of Ephesus and demanded of Nestorius a retraction of his impure doctrines, convoked three times, he did not comply: arrogant as he was, he overwhelmed with blasphemous words those who had been dispatched to him and, even in this circumstance, did not restrain his blasphemous tongue. And then, the reunion blessed above all of these bishops — after having subjected to debate his venomous doctrines and made appear to each the Judaic spirit, after having in some way proven in the crucible the interpretations that he gave of them in the church to those who were subordinate to him and demonstrated their abomination thanks to the fire of rational investigation — decreed a just sentence against his atheistic language and deposed the impious one from the honor of the pastoral charge. But the Eastern bishops, having voluntarily withdrawn from this holy synod — because they militated in favor of the corrupt doctrines of Nestorius and had distanced themselves from the universal communion — did not want in any way to acquiesce to the deposition of this evil demon. As for the word 'Mother of God', many among them either refused absolutely to attribute it to the Holy Virgin, or, when they were constrained, added that it was necessary, moreover, following the vain terminology of Nestorius, that she also be 'Mother of the man', and, by these iniquitous doctrines, they advanced towards a duality of sons and of Christs. As Theodosius, piously deceased, reigned at that time and had written to them to rejoin the communion and unity of the other bishops, they said: We do not accept to acquiesce to the deposition of Nestorius and to embrace communion with the bishops except only on the condition that all the treatises of Saint Cyril be destroyed by unanimous consent, so that, with these treatises, the refutation of the impure doctrines of Nestorius might also be annihilated. Now, Saint Cyril not even agreeing to lend an ear to this demand, they renounced a vain and unreasonable struggle and sent to Alexandria Paul, bishop of Emesa — this city belongs to Phoenician Lebanon — bearer of a conciliatory writing, by the terms of which all the Eastern bishops, fleeing the vain terminology of Nestorius, had confessed aloud that the Holy Virgin is Mother of God, and one unique Son and Christ, the same, begotten of the Father according to divinity and, the same, (born) of Mary, Virgin Mother, according to the flesh. Cyril, faced with these declarations as with a net (that was being set for him), promptly concluded peace with them and wisely made use of the net! He demanded of them, in fact, to acquiesce to the deposition of Nestorius and to cast anathema upon the inanity of a corrupt terminology. — One finds in the treatises of Saint Cyril himself, I say, the confirmation of the thing. — When they had made this profession, he accepted, without risk henceforth, the summary expressions of the conciliatory writing, like words of children who stammer, so that, stammering thus with them, he might elevate them to a more refined terminology. That we do not draw this from our own spirit, we demonstrate by the very treatises of Saint Cyril. He has, in fact, written to Acacius, bishop of Melitene.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the letter to Acacius<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup>: "No consideration convinces us to say that what we wrote with exactitude against the blasphemies of Nestorius was not written happily. They must rather — as was the opinion of the pious emperor friend of Christ and of the holy synod assembled at Ephesus — exile the one who fights against the glory of our Savior, and anathematize his iniquitous blasphemies and recognize his deposition."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Without doubt, one will say, but, in the conciliatory writings, the Eastern bishops said that there was union of two natures. How therefore shall we not say that the unique Christ is two natures? — We too do not deny that there was union of two natures! However, the union no longer tolerates that the two remain two, but it shows that, from two realities, one unique (reality) has been formed. Hear again the word of Cyril: he is, in fact, himself, of his own thought an interpreter who does not lie.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the same letter to Acacius<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup>: "We say, in fact, that there was union of two natures, but we confess clearly one unique Christ, one unique Son, one unique Lord. For the Word became flesh<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup>, according to the Scriptures, and we say that a reunion of dissimilar things has been truly realized into a union Conformable to the economy, ineffable and indissociable. For we are not going to think in the manner of certain ancient heretics, that it is by drawing from his own nature, that is to say from the divine (nature), that the Word of God constituted for himself a body; following on the contrary everywhere the inspired Scriptures, we affirm that he took it from the Holy Virgin. It is consequently inasmuch as we grasp in thought the (elements) from which is constituted the unique and only Son and our Lord Jesus-Christ, that we say that two natures have been reunited; but after the union, the separation into two being henceforth suppressed, we believe that the nature of the Son is unique, seeing that it is of one (being) unique, but incarnate and made man."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore, after having heard Saint Cyril (declare) that the union has suppressed the separation into two and formed one unique nature, that of the incarnate God Word, that it is limited to making appear without confusion the (elements) from which is constituted the unique and only Christ, without separating into a duality those who have been once reunited, how, dissolving the one who is one, do you declare two natures after the union? But perhaps you will say again: And what do you say about the declarations cited in the conciliatory writings of the Orientals, thus formulated?: "[OF THE ORIENTALS] 'As for the evangelical and apostolic words relating to Christ, we know that the theophoric men make some common, as (relative) to one person, but distinguish among the others, as (relative) to the two natures: those that befit God, they attribute according to the divinity of Christ, and those that have to do with the state of humiliation, to the humanity.'" These are the gross words of the sick that you have pronounced. Do not hide the solicitude of the physician! For the distinction of the words, he does not accept it in such a way as to distribute them between two natures and to attribute some to the divine nature alone and the others solely to the (nature) human. But, since there is one unique nature of the incarnate Word, we recognize a distinction of the words, of which some befit God, others have been said according to the humanity, and others which befit both the divinity and the humanity together. It was necessary, in fact, because he is God by nature and that he became, the same, truly man for us, that we have recourse to the two kinds of words, as Saint Cyril himself says somewhere<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup>. But let him not, for this reason, be divided into two natures! For all the words, whatever they may be, belong to one (being) unique, to the God Word who became incarnate for us: the nature, in fact, (namely) that of the Word himself, incarnate, is said to be unique after the union. Let one not understand therefore the distinction of the words as a state of division, but as a procedure of investigation, which is limited to distinguishing the difference of the words, as THE BLESSED BASIL, in the treatise 'On the Faith' or 'On the Trinity', also says in these terms<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup>: 'It was not fitting, in fact, that the lowering to your weakness should become a diminution of the dignity of the Strong. But understand the nature as it befits God, and accept according to the economy the words relative to the state of humiliation.'</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Let us examine again, if one wishes, the manner in which Saint Cyril undertakes the defense of these (ideas). I have said previously, in fact, to consider not only the words of the debility, but also those of the medication<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the same letter to Acacius<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup>: "But perhaps the adversaries will say this: Here is clearly that those who make profession of the true faith speak of two natures and expound at length that the theological statements are distributed because of their difference. And how would that not oppose your (assertions)? For you do not admit either that one distributes the words between two persons or two hypostases! — But, my dear, I will say that we have written in the chapters: 'If anyone distributes the words between two persons or two hypostases, and attributes some to the man, recognized separately outside of the God Word, and the others, which befit God, to the Word alone issued from the God Father, let him be anathema!'<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup> We have in no way suppressed the distinction of the words, although we have refused to distribute them between the Son taken separately, the Word issued from the Father, and the man, taken also separately, who would be recognized as the Son issued from the woman. For the nature of the Word is manifestly one: we understand it, in fact, incarnate and made man."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now, the formulations coming from the Orientals also concord with this thought of Saint Cyril, for they have said: Take according to the divinity of Christ those that befit God, and according to the humanity those that befit the state of humiliation. That is, in fact, the proper of people who make it understood that they content themselves with recognizing a difference among the words, but who do not distribute them separately between each of the natures. Otherwise they would have said: Those that befit God are formulated by the divine nature, and the human nature formulates those that befit the humanity, as the impious Nestorius had said.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup>: "The seed of Abraham, (which is) 'yesterday and today'<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup>, according to the word of Paul, is not the one who says: 'Before Abraham was, I am'<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup>. Similar in all to his brothers<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup>, the one who took the brotherhood of the human soul and of the flesh, is not the one who says: 'He who sees me, sees the Father'<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup>. It is the apostle consubstantial to us and anointed to announce liberation to captives and sight to the blind<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup>, who said: 'For the Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because it is he who has anointed me'<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup>. It is the humanity that is anointed, and not the divinity, heretic!"</p>

        <p class="paragraph">FROM THE IMPIOUS THEODORET, of the [ideas] similar to those, drawn from what he said against the tenth anathematism<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup>: "But it is that which is of the race of David that he assumed, that which is mortal, that which is passible, that which dreaded death — although in the sequel he destroyed the power of death, thanks to the union of the Word who had assumed it — that which walked in all justice and said to John: 'Allow it for the moment, for it is fitting that we thus accomplish full justice'<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup>. You see how he applies to the human nature and to the one who is of the seed of David a separate word, and separate words, in saying: The one who said to John: 'Allow it for the moment, for it is fitting that we thus accomplish full justice'."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">There are also found (ideas) similar to those in the impious Tome of Leo, which the synod of Chalcedon confirmed.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">FROM THE IMPIOUS TOME OF LEO<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup>: "It does not belong to the same nature to say: 'I and the Father are one'<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup> and to say: 'My Father is greater than I'<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup>."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But it is not the same for Saint Cyril! See how, on the contrary, while also making appear the difference of the words, he says that all are expressed in an indivisible manner by one (being) unique, and not that the divine nature formulates some and the human nature the others.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the same letter to Acacius<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup>: "Indeed, among the words, there are some that befit God, others again that befit man, and others, occupying an intermediate rank, that reveal that the Son of God is, in the same, God and man together. Indeed, when he says to Philip: 'I have been with you for so long, and you have not known me, Philip! Do you not believe that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me? He who has seen me, has seen the Father<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup>. I and the Father, we are one'<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup>, the word, we affirm, befits God. But when he reprimands the Jewish crowds, saying this: 'If you were the sons of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham. Now you seek to put me to death, me, the man who has told you the truth. That, Abraham did not do'<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup>, it is as it befits man, we say, that these (words) have been pronounced. Nevertheless it is to the unique Son that belong both what befits God and on the other hand also what befits man. For, being God, he became man, without rejecting being God, but he rather became it by taking flesh and blood<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup>. And since the Son, God and Lord, is unique, we say, we and they, that the person also is unique. We call, on the other hand, intermediate the words of this kind: when the blessed Paul writes: 'Jesus-Christ, (who is) yesterday and today, is, the same, also eternally'<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup>; again: 'Even if there are, indeed, some who are called gods, whether in heaven, whether on earth — as there exist (in fact) a good number of gods and a good number of lords — nevertheless, for us, there is but one God, the Father, from whom come all things and from whom we (come), and one Lord, Jesus-Christ, by whom (are) all things and by whom we (exist)'<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup>; and again: 'For I would wish to be myself rejected, away from Christ, for my brothers, my parents according to the flesh, the Israelites, to whom belong the adoption, the glory, the covenant, the Law, the worship, the promises and the Patriarchs, those from whom, according to the flesh, is issued the Christ, who is God, blessed above all, eternally. So be it'<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup>. Behold indeed, behold that, speaking of Christ Jesus, he says that he is, the same, God, 'yesterday and today' and 'eternally', and that through him all has been made; and the one who is 'issued from the Jews according to the flesh', he calls him 'God above all', and says him again 'blessed eternally'. Do not set apart in all this the words that concern the Lord. For one finds in them at the same time what befits God and (what is) human. Refer them rather to the unique Son, that is to say to the incarnate God Word. Behold therefore that the sense of the words of Saint Cyril is evident for all the world, who explains in what manner he admits the distinction of the words: he brings the rudeness of expression (of the Orientals) to a sound sense, being limited to recognizing a difference, (by virtue of which) there are among them some that befit God, others that befit man, and others still which are not differentiated, since they present no difference between them, but which show, in the same word, what befits God and what is human.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Let us therefore examine whether he took distinction for division, and whether he said, following the vain and impious terminology of Nestorius, of Theodoret and of the impious Tome of Leo, that the divine nature formulates certain words and the human nature formulates others. But we do not find (that)! It is the opposite that he alleges in saying: It is one thing to separate the natures, and that after the union, and to say that a man was joined to God only by an equality of dignity, and, similarly, another thing to recognize the difference of the words. Where then does the expression of these (assertions) agree with the vain terminology of Nestorius? Having begun, in one part of the letter (cited) above<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup>, by suppressing the separation of the natures — since he did not say two (natures) after the union, but recognizes one unique nature of the incarnate God Word — he has, by that very fact, also suppressed the division of the words. For he says<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup>: "We have in no way suppressed the distinction of the words, although we have refused to distribute them between the Son, taken separately, the Word issued from God, and the man, taken also separately, who is recognized as the Son who was born of the woman. For the nature of the Word is manifestly one, and we understand it incarnate and made man." AND AGAIN<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup>: "Nevertheless it is to the unique Son that belong both what befits God and, on the other hand, also what has to do with the man." AND AGAIN<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup>: "Refer them well rather to the unique Son, that is to say to the incarnate God Word."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Moreover, that Saint Cyril was conscious of having himself used condescension towards the rudeness of the formulas, for the reasons that we have previously expressed, we learn from what he wrote. For he took the defense of those who had accepted (his) wise medication.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the same letter to Acacius<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup>: "Indeed, if it seems to some that the tenor of the texts and the presentation of the formulas are far from the most fine precision, there is no reason to be astonished. For it is difficult to express things of this kind." FROM THE SAME, from the letter to Eulogius, concerning the same condescension towards the Orientals<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup>: "That is what the Orientals have professed, even if in regard to expression they have been somewhat obscure." And as John, the bishop of the Church of Antioch, had remained at this same rudeness of formulas and had written to someone things of this kind: "The Alexandrian has taught us to share appropriately the words between the natures"<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup>, SAINT CYRIL, wisely defending himself in the same letter to Acacius, declared<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup>: "Similar words do not come from me, but have been formulated by him!" Thus therefore, whereas Saint Cyril declared that the expression (of it) was far from the most fine precision, that the Orientals had been obscure in the presentation of (their) exposition and that such words were not his, but had been formulated by them, how, you, do you exhibit them as if they had been formulated by Saint Cyril himself, without signaling the cause for which they were formulated, without citing the person of those who formulated them, nor the wise interpretation (that he gave them) of the one who condescended to them, (and) by which he made (the Orientals) the prisoners of orthodox thought? But, camouflaging all these unhealthy (procedures) of your perverse cunning, you thought to deceive everyone! You have not even weighed in spirit the word of the psalm which says: "Does he who planted the ear not hear? Or does he who formed the eyes not perceive?"<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup> And you have acted in the manner of someone who, by blows and gashes, would rend open a wound that had cicatrized and exhibit it to passers-by, or of a man who, criticizing schoolmasters, would assimilate the clumsy language of little children, so that, by exercise, what is easy to pronounce might perfect their tongue!</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That it is necessary to examine carefully the very important reasons for (this) way of acting and that we should not confront without precautions subtle words and things, hear what the wise John, who was bishop of Constantinople, says about it in the fifth of the panegyrical treatises that he composed concerning Paul. FROM SAINT JOHN, BISHOP OF CONSTANTINOPLE, from the fifth discourse relative to the apostle Paul<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup>: "Thus Paul also, imitating his master, was not known otherwise than sometimes as a Jew and sometimes as detached from the Law. For sometimes he observed the Law and sometimes he neglected the Law; sometimes he attached himself to life here below and sometimes, on the contrary, he despised it, sometimes he asked for goods, sometimes he rejected even those that were given to him; he offered sacrifices and shaved his head, and, on the contrary, he cast anathema upon those who did it, sometimes he conferred circumcision and sometimes he rejected circumcision. And if these (facts) that took place were contradictory, the intention and the spirit from which they proceeded were very logical and coherent with themselves: he sought, in fact, only one thing, the salvation of those who heard and saw them! And it is for that reason that sometimes he observed the Law and sometimes he suppressed it. For it is not only in his acts, but also in his writings that he varied and changed: not that he evolved in (his) thought, nor that he became other, other than he was, but because, remaining what he was, he accomplished each of the aforementioned things having regard to the present circumstance. Do not speak ill of him therefore because of these (variations), but praise him and celebrate him well rather for these (attitudes)! And indeed, when you see a doctor who resorts sometimes to cauterization and sometimes to feeding, who employs sometimes the knife and sometimes the poultice, who sometimes forbids food and drink and sometimes prescribes that the sick person be satiated with them at his will, who sometimes covers him entirely and sometimes imposes on him who is in the grip of fever to drink a goblet filled with cold water, you do not accuse him of change nor of vain fickleness, but you praise rather then the art of these procedures which for us are contradictory and harmful. You see him intervene with confidence and promise health: it is, in fact, an experienced man! Now if we accept that a doctor performs (actions) contradictory, we must much more praise Paul himself, who intervenes in the same manner with those who are sick. For those who are sick in soul have no less need of a line of conduct adapted than those who are sick in body, and if it is applied to them too abruptly, all the (chances) of saving them escape."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Who is he who, hearing these wise words of the Spirit, would not admire the wise therapeutics of Saint Cyril? He accepted the Orientals who declared that there was union of two natures, but he explained the formula: by reason of the union of the two natures was formed one unique nature of the incarnate God Word, so that it is no longer possible henceforth to say two natures after the union. He declared moreover that the distinction of the words did not imply division but difference, as has already been demonstrated above. And how would it not be a wise therapeutics that tore from these sick (people) (their unhealthy opinion)? It which accepted to condescend to these summary formulas, to sweeten thanks to them the cup as with honey, to inoculate unbeknownst to them (to the Orientals) the medicine of salvation, to persuade them to reject the vain terminology of Nestorius and to conform to the writings (of Cyril), without leaving sterile (these writings) from which they were to learn that the union of the two natures made appear to us one unique nature of the incarnate Word, and that it is necessary to call the distinction of the words not a division but a difference: accustomed in this way to orthodoxy, they were going to despise henceforth also the rudeness of their expressions. Let those who assume the defense of the synod of Chalcedon — among whom is ranged equally the creator and father of this miserable libel — not rush therefore like impudent flies upon ulcers, but let them seek the wisdom of the remedies that operate health, and let them not trouble, by breathing the venom of heresy, the spiritual ointment of the doctrine of the theophoric Fathers. As the Ecclesiastes said: "Dead flies spoil the preparation of perfumed oil."<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">9. NINTH CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the same letter to John<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup>: "It was necessary, indeed, yes, it was necessary to understand clearly that we have undertaken a total combat, so to speak, for the faith, in affirming that the Holy Virgin is Mother of God. But if we say that the holy body of our Savior of all, the Christ, is born from heaven, and not from her, how would one still conceive that she is Mother of God? For who, in a word, did she give birth to, if it is not true that she gave birth to Emmanuel according to the flesh?"</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY — If, like Saint Cyril, you yourself and the synod of Chalcedon, whose apology you claim to make, had confessed that the Holy Virgin is Mother of God, you would not have said that there are two natures after the union, but well that Emmanuel is one from the two, and one unique nature of the incarnate God Word. Now, that dividing Christ into two natures excludes the very word "Mother of God", one can learn from the corrupt teachings of Nestorius, who, under pretext of fearing mixture and of undertaking the struggle against heretics, in truth combats the thought of the orthodox faith. FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS<sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup>: "It was in the time of Arius, of Eunomius, of Apollinarius and of all the partisans of that band that the concern appeared to introduce the title of 'Mother of God', in the idea that there had been mixture of two natures and that nothing of the conditions of abasement taken by the humanity was separated (from the divinity). The way was henceforth opened for them against the divinity — all things being said as coming from one alone, not according to the dignity that comes from the conjunction, but according to the nature also. — For Christ is one, and one the Lord<sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup>. But as for what concerns Christ, as for what concerns the Monogenes Son, I say, the word 'Christ' and the word 'Son' are attributed sometimes to the divinity sometimes to the humanity, and sometimes to the divinity and to the humanity."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">SAINT CYRIL, speaking against these blasphemies (of Nestorius), in the second tome, expressed himself thus<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup>: "The inventor of this new impiety, while affecting to say one unique Christ, separates the natures everywhere, puts each of them apart, and declares that they were not truly united one to the other. Taking pretexts in his sins<sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup>, following what is written, he invents a mode of conjunction, that, I have said, which is realized by the sole equality of dignity, as appears from his own words. He makes the Word issued from God dwell, by metaphor, in an ordinary man, and he separates the evangelical words so as to attribute them sometimes to the Word alone and taken separately, and sometimes separately to the one who comes from the woman. And how would it not be indubitable for all that it is by being naturally God that the Monogenes became man, not simply by a conjunction that comes from outside, as he says, or of (pure) complaisance, but according to a true union, in an ineffable manner and which surpasses understanding? In this way he is recognized unique and alone; every word befits him, and all is formulated as by one unique person. For one recognizes only one unique nature after the union, that of the Word himself, incarnate."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">You have heard the words of Saint Cyril: you have (thereby) learned not to separate the natures. Here is what he defines: that the nature of the Word, incarnate, be said unique. Show therefore that the synod of Chalcedon does not separate the natures after the union and that it confesses one unique nature of the incarnate God Word, and you will prove, without artifice, that, conformably to the opinion of Saint Cyril, it has said the Holy Virgin Mother of God. If, on the contrary, it says two natures, and by that very fact divides the unique Christ, it does not escape that, strongly uttering the word "Mother of God", it has professed it with the thought of deceiving many, just as Nestorius had done. Here is that he too expressed himself clearly in this way. FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS<sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup>: "I have already said it often before, and now again I have no repugnance to repeat it; if there is among you or among others some simple person whom the word 'Mother of God' rejoices, for my part, I feel no antipathy towards this word. Only, let no one make of the Virgin a goddess!"</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">10. TENTH CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the same letter to John<sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup>: "He has been called also 'heavenly man'<sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup>, perfect as he is according to the divinity and perfect according to the humanity, and understood as being in one single person. For the Lord Jesus-Christ is one, although one does not ignore the difference of the natures, from which we say that the ineffable union has been realized. As for those who say that there has been mixture or confusion or amalgamation of the God Word with the flesh, let your Holiness deign to shut their mouth."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY — Not forgetting, once again, to practice a sacrilegious theft on the texts, he has suppressed here also the word which excludes the separation into two, as follows: "Perfect as he is according to the divinity and perfect as he is, the same, according to the humanity." Thus therefore, after having cut out "the same", he thinks, in his foolishness, that each of the natures is perfect in the isolation of its subsistence, and he ignores that the fiction of his malign cunning is refuted by what follows: "For our Lord Jesus-Christ is one, it is said, although one does not ignore the difference of the natures, from which we say that the ineffable union has been realized." Now, this "from which" so well establishes the hypostatic union, which makes Emmanuel appear unique from two natures, that this slanderer — because he also recognized the thing — in the course of the chapters cited above, where he supported the definition of those who gathered at Chalcedon, in the fourth chapter, has voluntarily cut out this expression which came in the sequel<sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup>. He wanted to avoid that, the chapters being confronted one with the other, the enunciations (of the Chalcedonians) would appear dissimilar to those of Saint Cyril, since they had suppressed this "from the two", and had defined, on the contrary, our unique Lord Jesus-Christ "in two natures".</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That things are well thus, I cite the testimony of the enemies themselves, which makes clearly understand that this "from the two" signifies a unique reality which has been constituted according to a composition such that, they think, confusion would result from it. FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS, from the letter to Theodoret that he wrote from exile to criticize this same letter of Cyril to John, as suppressing the separation of the two natures<sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup>: "The Word, he says, is called also heavenly man<sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup>, perfect as he is according to the divinity and perfect as he is, the same, according to the humanity. He does not say: 'being perfect God in a perfect man', but: 'perfect as he is according to the divinity and perfect, the same, according to the humanity', in order to accredit, by making of the complete natures parts that correspond to each other, a confusion that the word of 'natures' suggests, confusion that from then on also conceals for him the word 'the same': not that Christ, or the Son, is the same, but the Word. 'The Word, he says indeed, has been called heavenly man, perfect as he is according to the divinity and perfect, the same, according to the humanity.' That is why, a little later, in this same text, when he mentions also the natures, words agreeable to the orthodox, the cunning has persisted; he introduces the confusion after having named the natures. (That is) a fiction that one cannot suspect! For what does he say? 'Although one does not ignore the difference of the natures, from which we say that the ineffable union has been realized.' Here again this 'from which'! He speaks of parts that correspond to each other concerning the natures of the Lord which would have become only one! He ought to have said, in fact, not 'from which', but 'of which we say that the ineffable union has been realized'. For it is not from the natures, but of the natures themselves that the ineffable union is made." That we do not imagine a separation into two, nor conceive that the natures existed in the isolation of their subsistence nor separately, but well rather in the hypostatic union, that is what Saint Cyril makes us understand, who declared: "from which we say that the ineffable union has been realized", as Nestorius himself, that enemy of the truth, has admitted in the words that we have just reported. He escapes moreover the calumny (of having admitted) confusion, by the fact that he says: "As for those who declare that there has been mixture or confusion or amalgamation of the God Word with the flesh, let your Holiness deign to reprimand them."</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">11. ELEVENTH CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the same letter to John<sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup>: "We all confess, moreover, that the Word of God is impassible, although, disposing himself in all wisdom of the mystery, one sees him attribute to himself the sufferings that occurred to the flesh. It is therefore for this reason that the most wise Peter said: 'Christ has therefore suffered for us in the flesh'<sup><a href="#fn92" id="ref92">92</a></sup>, and not in the ineffable nature of the divinity. It is so that one may believe, in fact, that he is the Savior of all, that he reports to himself, by an appropriation conformable to the economy, as I have said, the sufferings of his flesh."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY — Those who confess the hypostatic union of the God Word with the flesh, endowed, it is understood, with an intelligent soul, and confess, for this motive, that the nature of the incarnate God Word is unique, profess the faith in this manner: the Monogenes appropriates the sufferings that occur in his flesh, because it is naturally and truly united to him, as the soul of the man which is ours is also to his body. Nevertheless, our soul feels the bruises of the flesh with it, and, because of the pain that results from it, it undergoes the suffering of terror, of fear and of other similar sentiments; and it is for fear of all that that it submits to the divine laws and accepts to accomplish what is imposed on it. Now, the God Word, because of the mode of the natural union, was called to what is in the order of suffering, if there had been possibility of it. But as he is not subject to sufferings because of the uncreated, immutable and unalterable character of his nature, he appropriates the sufferings of his flesh, but nonetheless remains in his own nature inaccessible to suffering. Those, on the contrary, who divide him into two, in declaring two natures after the union, say that the sufferings of the flesh are reported to him by a relation of complaisance, like a king who suffers, when one has soiled his effigy which is dear to him. We know it with evidence by the citation that follows. FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS, from the letter to Bishop Alexander<sup><a href="#fn93" id="ref93">93</a></sup>: "There are, in my opinion, two modes of appropriation: one consists in a (common) natural affection in the sufferings, like that of the soul and of the body, the other results from a thought [of complaisance], exempt from suffering, provoked by an affection, as kings have for their own effigies. If therefore we say that the Word suffered by an appropriation analogous to that which takes place in the case of the soul and of the body, the passibility common to the Word and to the flesh implies suffering in the two. For the soul and the body suffer equally, one because of the other, one with the other. For it is not without the body that the soul endures the pains of the body, and it is not without the soul that the body (endures the pains of the soul), from the fact that the suffering (that they undergo) together, both and one by the other, is natural to them."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus also therefore the flesh is afflicted, by appropriation of the affliction of the soul, and the soul endures with the flesh the sufferings of the latter. On the contrary, if we refer to God the ignominy of the cross, proper to the flesh, as (happens for the king) by means of the royal effigy, it remains that it is by appealing to a love of intellectual order that we attribute to the divinity this ignominy proper to the flesh. Such is the truth that overturns heretical chatter, which confuses what cannot be confused. For they want, they, to apply to God the sufferings of the temple, by virtue of a natural appropriation, as I have said, and not by virtue of a thought of complaisance towards his temple. From this, for them, the attribution, logical, to the God Word, of all the natural properties of the flesh, so that it is henceforth no longer possible for the properties of the divinity and (those) of the flesh to be separated according to their nature.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the Scholia, what is contrary to these assertions<sup><a href="#fn94" id="ref94">94</a></sup>: "But if it is necessary — whereas, ordinarily, we can scarcely understand and express things of little importance — that we represent to ourselves realities as subtle and surpassing understanding and discourse, we say that it is fitting to think — the expression is in any case inferior to the truth — that the union of the Emmanuel is of the kind of what one would represent to be that of the human soul with its body. For the soul attributes to itself what belongs to the body, although in its own nature it is exempt from its passions, both from those which are natural (to the body) and from those which are added from outside. The body, in fact, is pushed to natural desires, and the soul which is in it, because of the union, feels them with it, but without participating in them in any manner. It certainly considers as its own enjoyment the satisfaction of the desire, and even, if it happens that the body is struck and torn by the iron, it suffers with it, since it is its body that suffers, but it itself, in its own nature, endures nothing of what affects it. But we say that the union which concerns the Emmanuel is still superior to that. It was necessary, in fact, that the soul which had been united to him, felt the pain with the body, so that, while escaping the blows, it might docilely bow its neck before God. As for what pertains to the God Word, it is out of place to say that he felt the blows, for God is impassible and is not in the conditions which are ours; but he was united to a flesh endowed with a rational soul: while the flesh suffered, he was, without suffering, conscious of what was happening in it. And while destroying, as God, the infirmities of the body, he attributed them to himself, inasmuch as they were proper to his body. It is in this sense also that he is said to have been hungry<sup><a href="#fn95" id="ref95">95</a></sup>, to have been weary<sup><a href="#fn96" id="ref96">96</a></sup> and to have suffered for us<sup><a href="#fn97" id="ref97">97</a></sup>. Also, it is not out of place that one would compare to our condition to us the union of the Word with humanity. For, just as the body is heterogeneous in relation to the soul, but a unique man is formed and declared (such) from the two, thus also, from the perfect hypostasis of the God Word and a humanity which is perfect according to its own reason, there is a unique Christ, the same, who is, in the same, both God and man."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Here we clearly learn that it is one thing to say that the God Word appropriates and elevates to himself the sufferings of the flesh, because it is naturally united to him — thus we say that to the soul of a man is united the body which is his and we establish, for this reason, that the suffering is his, because the body which has suffered and which is also united to him according to the hypostasis is his — and similarly, it is another thing to say that, the natures being divided, it is by a relation of complaisance and a love of intellectual order — as Nestorius said — that the divine nature appropriates the sufferings which occur to the human nature. We must therefore not let ourselves be troubled by a resemblance of words, but realize the spirit of the theophoric Cyril, who is sheltered from the stain of the heretics.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">12. TWELFTH CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the letter to Eulogius, apocrisiary to Constantinople, of which here is the beginning: "Some take issue with the exposition made by the Orientals..."<sup><a href="#fn98" id="ref98">98</a></sup> — "But since all the Orientals believe that we, the orthodox, adhere to the perverse opinion of Apollinarius and that we think there has been mixture and confusion — these are indeed the terms they employ, as if (according to us) the God Word had passed into the nature of the flesh, and the flesh had been changed into the nature of the divinity! — we have let them, not divide into two the only Son, not at all! but only profess that, far from there having been confusion or mixture, the flesh is flesh, as a thing taken from the woman, and the Word, as begotten of the Father, is Word, while unique is the Christ and Son and Lord, according to the word of John<sup><a href="#fn99" id="ref99">99</a></sup>."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY — What are you doing, man of all the most wicked and corrupt? Why do you rush like an impudent dog upon the words of the Saint and vainly tear apart what has been said in excellent terms? Here again, in fact, it suffices us, to refute your shameful procedure, to cite the words which precede the chapter and which you have voluntarily cut out. For it clearly emerges from them that, although the flesh which was taken from the woman is not mingled with the Word, he is however unique from the two and his nature is unique, because the Word became incarnate. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the letter to Eulogius, what is found before the chapter and which the adversary has omitted<sup><a href="#fn100" id="ref100">100</a></sup>: "Some take issue, in fact, with the exposition made by the Orientals and say: Whereas they spoke of two natures, why does the Alexandrian take it upon himself and praise it? The adherents of (the ideas) of Nestorius say that he too shares the same opinion, and they drag in their wake those who ignore precision. To these critics we must say this: It is not necessary to flee nor to reject all that the heretics say, for they profess a great number of points that we also profess. Thus, for example, when the Arians say that the Father is creator of the universe and Lord, does it follow, for that very reason, that we flee such professions? And it is the same for Nestorius, even when he declares two natures, meaning (by that) only the difference of the flesh and the God Word. For one thing, in fact, is the nature of the Word and another thing is that of the flesh. But he does not confess with us, in addition, the union. For we, uniting these elements, confess one unique Christ, one only Son, the same, one unique Lord, and thence one unique nature of the incarnate Son, as is the case also for an ordinary man. It results, in fact, from different natures, from the body, I say, and from the soul. Reason and consideration (of the spirit) recognize this difference; but as soon as we unite them, we (thereby) make one unique nature of man. Thus therefore, to recognize the difference of the natures is not to split into two the unique Christ."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Here he clearly makes understood by this that to recognize the difference of the natures, from which (is constituted) the unique Christ, is not to destroy the union, and that Nestorius does not profess the union as we do, because he does not recognize one unique nature, that of the incarnate God Word. How then, after having suppressed all that, do you bring the rest to the debate, after having violently detached it? And because Saint Cyril said that the natures, from which (is constituted) the unique Christ, were without confusion, do you think that you will seduce the simple, to the point that they will confess two natures after the union and that they will not rather recognize that one unique nature has been formed, that of the incarnate God Word?</p>

As there were there disputants who said that the God Word formed for himself a body by a change of his own nature, he affirms everywhere that the body was not consubstantial to the Word. But if it was not consubstantial to him, it was a nature entirely other."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY — Here again, misled by his sacrilegious spirit, he has cut out the sequel, which reveals the sentiment of the Saint; it is thus worded<sup><a href="#fn102" id="ref102">102</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "... entirely other is the nature (of the elements) from which is recognized the unique and only Christ."</p>

If therefore we say union, we profess that of the flesh, endowed with an intelligent soul, and of the Word, and those who say two natures understand it thus. But the union once proclaimed, one no longer separates from one another the elements which have been reunited."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY — The sequel suffices for the refutation, in this also, which reveals the theft of which the words of Saint Cyril are the object. It is thus worded<sup><a href="#fn104" id="ref104">104</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "But the union once proclaimed, one no longer separates from one another the elements which have been reunited; henceforth, on the contrary, the Son is unique and his nature is unique, because the Word became incarnate. This is what the Orientals professed, although they were somewhat obscure in regard to expression." And it is very just! For those who say that there was a union of two natures understand things thus: from the union, one must henceforth profess one unique nature of the incarnate God Word. In this way, in fact, we do not separate from one another the elements which have been reunited. But if we persist, still after the union, in saying two, we stumble in ourselves as in a profound obscurity, blind as we are when it comes to expressing ourselves: and we profess the union and, then, we destroy the union by the duality!</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY — It is now the moment to address to you the words of the prophet: "Deaf, hear, blind, see!"<sup><a href="#fn106" id="ref106">106</a></sup> If, in fact, you confess the difference of the natures, from which (is constituted) the unique and only Christ, do not split him for this motive, by saying two natures after the union. Now, what is implied by the fact of not splitting and of saying one unique nature of the incarnate God Word, you realize it with evidence, when one presents to the debate, in their integrity, the texts which you have truncated with perversity and which we have cited above, in the twelfth chapter, censuring the theft committed by your malign cunning. And to avoid appearing afflicted with an ignorance similar to yours, we must also reveal this: the present chapter, which is, in order, the first in relation to the others drawn from the letter to Eulogius, you have cited it last. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the letter to Eulogius, what the adversary has cut out<sup><a href="#fn107" id="ref107">107</a></sup>: "For we, uniting these elements, confess one unique Christ, one only Son, the same, one unique Lord, and thence one unique nature of the incarnate God Word, as is the case also for an ordinary man.

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">16. SIXTEENTH CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the writing "On the Incarnation", of which here is the beginning: "It is profound, great and admirable."<sup><a href="#fn108" id="ref108">108</a></sup> — "How therefore did he become like us? By taking a body from the Holy Virgin, a body not deprived of a soul, as it pleased certain, perfect heretics, but rather endowed with an intelligent soul. Thus he came forth from the woman, a complete man, except for sin<sup><a href="#fn109" id="ref109">109</a></sup>, truly and not in appearance or by false semblance."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY — Why do you want to truncate thus, without cease and with temerity, the texts of Saint Cyril? Do you claim, by the present chapter, to demonstrate that the Holy Virgin gave birth to an ordinary man? But we, with wisdom, do not limit ourselves to producing the sequel, but also the text which is found before the chapter: it clearly emerges from it that the Emmanuel is recognized to be complete man and God, the same, and that, for this motive, the Holy Virgin is Mother of God. Now, what follows immediately is thus worded. FROM SAINT CYRIL, the text which follows the chapter<sup><a href="#fn110" id="ref110">110</a></sup>: "Thus he came forth from the woman, a complete man, except for sin<sup><a href="#fn111" id="ref111">111</a></sup>, truly and not in appearance or by false semblance, without having been diminished in relation to his divine being, without having lost also having always been and being God. And it is thus that we say that the Holy Virgin is Mother of God. As the blessed Paul said indeed: 'There is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and one Lord, Jesus-Christ, through whom are all things<sup><a href="#fn112" id="ref112">112</a></sup>.'" And here is the text which precedes the chapter<sup><a href="#fn113" id="ref113">113</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "Thus he voluntarily humbled himself to the humiliation<sup><a href="#fn114" id="ref114">114</a></sup>, he who gives to all from his fullness<sup><a href="#fn115" id="ref115">115</a></sup>. He humbled himself for us, without being forced by anyone, but he voluntarily took for us the condition of a slave, he who by his nature is free. He was in these conditions which are ours, he who is above every creature; in what is subject to death, he who is the vivifier of all. For it is he who is 'the bread of life descended from heaven' and 'gives life to the world'<sup><a href="#fn116" id="ref116">116</a></sup>. He was with us under the Law, he who is above the Law and legislator as God; he was among those who receive existence and the principle of their being, he who is before all ages and times, indeed, who is the creator of the ages. How therefore did he become like us?" And so on, what he cited in the chapter.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Who is he who would not turn away with horror from a turpitude like his? As if he had amputated a beautiful body of the organs of the senses, from which the physiognomy draws its attraction, he presented it without the color which charms the sight, by empurpling it with blood and redness and by rendering the aspect repugnant. (Thus) he brought to the debate words of the Saint, which he had detached from their harmonious connection and stripped of their beauty, to make appear, thanks to them, he believed, as defender of his own impiety, the doctor of integral orthodoxy.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY — It is superfluous to expand on this chapter. In the ninth chapter, in fact, we have clearly shown that he who confesses, following the spirit of Saint Cyril, that the Holy Virgin is Mother of God, confesses by the very fact that the nature of the incarnate God Word is unique. For to declare two natures after the union is to destroy the word "Mother of God".</p>

But from the fact that we say 'Mother of God', we necessarily imply also the signification of this term.

The confession of the incarnation therefore always precedes."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY — He still believes, in line with his entirely impious thought, to demonstrate on the basis of this chapter, that it is the body only, deprived of union with the Word, which was born of the Holy Virgin, because the Saint declared: "As for what concerned the nature of the flesh, the Holy Virgin gave birth to a body consubstantial to us and to her." But, manifestly, he misleads, and he truncates the text of the Saint. For the Saint first united the body to the Word of God, and it is afterwards that he said that the body was born of the Holy Virgin. Here is the text<sup><a href="#fn119" id="ref119">119</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "We say, in fact, that the Word of God became man, without undergoing change. And as for what concerned the nature of the flesh, the Holy Virgin gave birth to a body consubstantial to her and to us." He has therefore shown by this that the body did not exist without being united with the Word — he said that the Word of God became man without undergoing change, and declared that the body which is his is born of the holy Virgin — and, by what follows, he showed the counterpart — it is not the divinity of the Monogenes all alone that she gave birth to, but well united to a flesh, meaning hypostatically. — Here is the text<sup><a href="#fn120" id="ref120">120</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "For it is not the divinity all alone that the Holy Virgin gave birth to, but the Word of God united to the flesh." What could be more revealing? Or how would it be possible for us to show comprehension towards people who expound an opinion that tends to division into two?</p>

For it is said that he took of the seed of Abraham<sup><a href="#fn123" id="ref123">123</a></sup>."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY — Cease mutilating with the scissors of division the texts of Saint Cyril. It would have been necessary, in the exposition, not to separate from the preceding the present chapter, which is coherent and connected to it, but to hold the two in one single chapter. In this manner, in fact, we would have perfectly recognized the opinion of the Saint. But the contrary preoccupies you, to hide rather the sound thought and to soil it with the slaver of your malignity. For here he has said clearly that the Christ had part like us in the blood and the flesh and that he was born of the Virgin, Mother of God. Since, it is said in fact, the children have had part in the blood and the flesh, he also has likewise had the same things in part<sup><a href="#fn124" id="ref124">124</a></sup>. Do not therefore remove from him the image (that he employs), but draw from it, as much as possible, by a precise consideration, the very idea of the divine incarnation. For likewise, the child or the man who is ours is (made) of a soul and a body, and the concurrence of the one with the other forms one unique nature, one unique hypostasis and one unique person, and it is not because the soul and the body are not of the same essence that we divide the one man into two natures, in the same way we also say that the Emmanuel is one unique Christ, one only Son and one only Lord, from the divinity and the humanity, which are perfect according to their own reason; and it is not because the essence of the divinity and that of the humanity are not one and the same thing, that we divide him into two natures. But let Saint Cyril intervene in the debate to explain himself! FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the second letter to Succensus<sup><a href="#fn125" id="ref125">125</a></sup>: "For, although we also say that the Monogenes, Son of God, who was incarnate and made man, is one, it is not for that reason that he is the fruit of a confusion, as it seems to them. For, neither did the nature of the Word pass into the nature of the flesh, nor that of the flesh into that of the Word. But each of them remaining and being recognized at once in the property inherent to its nature, according to the exposition that we have just given, the ineffable and inexplicable union has manifested to us one unique nature of the Son, but, as I have said, incarnate. For one speaks rightly of unity not only concerning those who are simple by nature, but also concerning those who have been assembled by composition, such as the hypostasis of man, made of soul and body. Such elements, certainly, are of different species and are unequal one to the other by nature; but once united, they make one unique nature of man, although, according to the reasons of the composite, one finds a difference in the nature of the elements which have arrived together at the union. Therefore, vain are the things uttered by those who say: If there is one unique nature of the God Word incarnate, it will always and necessarily follow that there will be confusion and mixture, seeing that the nature of the man has been diminished and frustrated. For it has been neither diminished, nor, as they say, frustrated. For it suffices, to signify perfectly that he became man, to say 'incarnate'. Certainly, if we had passed that over in silence, there would have been place for their calumny; but since one necessarily adds it, where is there, in some way, diminution or deception?"</p>

TWENTIETH CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the second letter to Aeacius of Aleppo, of which here is the beginning: "It is a concern befitting him that Your Holiness has just imposed upon yourself..."<sup><a href="#fn126" id="ref126">126</a></sup> — "Let certain perverse ones not vomit forth sustaining against us their discourses, spreading that we share the ideas of Apollinarius, Arius and Eunomius, as they wrote at Ephesus. For, as far as I am concerned, by the grace of our Savior Jesus, I have been orthodox, I have been educated by the care of an orthodox father and I have never shared the ideas of Apollinarius, far from it! nor those of Arius or Eunomius, nor indeed those of any other heretic; rather I declare them anathema. For indeed, I do not say that the body of Christ is deprived of a soul, but I confess that it was endowed with an intelligent soul. And I affirm that there has been neither confusion nor amalgamation nor mixture, as certain say, but I hold that the Word of God is by nature immutable, unalterable and, in his own nature, rebellious to all suffering. For the divinity is impassible and refuses to undergo the shadow of a change<sup><a href="#fn127" id="ref127">127</a></sup>. It is rather solidly established in its own goods, and it enjoys irreparably the state in which it finds itself. Now, the Christ and Lord, the Monogenes, the Son of God being one, I say that it is he who suffered for us in the flesh, according to the Scriptures, namely the word of the blessed Peter<sup><a href="#fn128" id="ref128">128</a></sup>."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY — What I have said concerning the nineteenth chapter and in the texts which have just been brought to the debate suffices, I think, to resolve this perfectly<sup><a href="#fn129" id="ref129">129</a></sup>. For it has been clearly demonstrated that, although the nature of the incarnate God Word is one, we do not hold that the body of the Lord is deprived of soul or spirit, and that we do not accept for all that the idea of a mixture or a confusion, but that, while maintaining that the Word of God is impassible in his nature, we say that he suffered in the flesh according to the divine Scriptures. We bring forth nevertheless still other texts of Saint Cyril on this subject. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the second letter to Succensus<sup><a href="#fn130" id="ref130">130</a></sup>: "But, although the body which was united to him is not equal in essence to the Word issued from God the Father, nor to the intelligent soul which is in him, and that the spirit represents, on the contrary, the heterogeneity of the elements which have been united, we confess only one unique Son and Lord and Christ, seeing that the Word became flesh<sup><a href="#fn131" id="ref131">131</a></sup>; and when we pronounce the word 'flesh', we say 'man'. What necessity is there therefore that he suffers in his own nature, if it is said, after the union, one unique nature of the incarnate Son? For, if there had been nothing in the conditions of the economy which was naturally apt to undergo suffering, it would have been with just title that they would have said: Since that which is of a nature to suffer did not exist, how was it not necessary that the suffering take place in the nature of the Word? But since, by saying 'incarnate', we produce entirely the reason of the economy linked to the flesh — for he did not become incarnate otherwise than by taking from the seed of Abraham<sup><a href="#fn132" id="ref132">132</a></sup>, being made in all things like us<sup><a href="#fn133" id="ref133">133</a></sup> and assuming the condition of a slave<sup><a href="#fn134" id="ref134">134</a></sup> — they babble in vain, those who declare that it follows of all necessity that he suffers in his own nature, while the flesh, in which one conceives very well that suffering occurs, is there and the Word himself is impassible. It is not for that reason however that we remove from him the attribution of the suffering. For, as the body became his, all that belongs to the body, except sin<sup><a href="#fn135" id="ref135">135</a></sup>, is not less said to have become his, by an appropriation conformable to the economy."</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">21-28. TWENTY-FIRST CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the commentary concerning the (goat) sent away, which he composed for Acacius, bishop of Scythopolis, of which here is the beginning: "Having read the letters written recently by Your Holiness, I rejoiced greatly..."<sup><a href="#fn136" id="ref136">136</a></sup> — "For he ordered to bring two goats and to mark them with two lots, so that the first of the goats would be called the Lord and the other the Emissary<sup><a href="#fn137" id="ref137">137</a></sup>. Thus the names of these goats were the Lord and the Emissary, but by the two it is the one and only Son, the Lord Jesus Christ who is designated."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY — This man filled with ignorance and the most accomplished impiety believes still to demonstrate, by the type of the two goats, that the Emmanuel is divided into two natures, from the fact that Saint Cyril said that "by the two it is the one Christ who is designated". But since it is by cutting the letter with his sacrilegious scissors that he made at his whim many chapters from it, that the image of the two goats is maintained up to the twenty-eighth chapter and that he claims to show there two natures and two Christs, one mortal and the other immortal, one passible and the other who remained above suffering, and not one and the same, who, inasmuch as he is God, is impassible and who, inasmuch as he is man, the same, is passible, I have deemed it better, before the artificial multiplicity of the chapters drawn from this letter from which they have been cut, to attach the apology (to the letter) itself — seeing that the refutation suits each of the chapters — to the address of him who, again, has voluntarily cut it, separating this (chapter) from the subsequent chapters, to precipitate himself, for his part, into the pit of error.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the same letter to Acacius concerning the (goat) sent away<sup><a href="#fn138" id="ref138">138</a></sup>: "But perhaps someone will say: How then do you say that the Son and Lord Jesus Christ is one and the same, when there has been question of two goats and two birds? Would the Law show (by that) unequivocally that there are necessarily two sons and (two) Christs? It is to this degree of impiety that some have already come in thinking and declaring that other is the Christ, the Word issued from the Father, taken apart, and other he who comes from the seed of David. For us, we say to those who, through ignorance, think that things are such: the divine Paul writes: 'There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism'<sup><a href="#fn139" id="ref139">139</a></sup>. Hence, if they say two sons, there are necessarily two lords, two faiths and just as many baptisms also. Therefore, he holds a lying discourse, he who, according to what he himself said, 'has Christ speaking in him'<sup><a href="#fn140" id="ref140">140</a></sup>. But it is not so, not at all! Thus therefore there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism! For we believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, that is to say in the Monogenes, Word of God, incarnate and made man. It is for that that we are baptized also in his death and that we recognize him alone as Lord and God, without positing apart the man and the God, but affirming that the Word, who is issued from God the Father, as I have said, became man while remaining God: for he is immutable and unalterable by nature. Let the adversaries decide therefore, supposing that they say two sons, one who is properly of the seed of David, and the other who is apart, the Word issued from God the Father, whether the Word who is issued from God the Father does not surpass by nature him who comes from the seed of David, and by incomparable differences? What then is the nature of man in face of the divine and transcendent (nature)? I believe moreover that, even unwillingly, they will say that the Word issued from God the Father surpasses by his nature. And what shall we do with those who see that the goats are not of different natures, one relative to the other, but rather of the same species, and that they differ in nothing in the fact of being what they are? The same consideration could be valid also for the two birds. Let them admit therefore, by reason of the identity of species of the goats or the birds, that the Word of God differs in nothing from man! But, as I believe, they will not admit such a way of seeing. Very great, indeed, is that which separates the divinity from the humanity. Let us leave besides to the examples the door that suits them. For they are inferior to the truth of the facts and signify only partially what they signify.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now, we say, the Law was a shadow<sup><a href="#fn141" id="ref141">141</a></sup>, a type and as a painting, if one may say, proposed as a spectacle to those who saw the realities themselves. The shadows of the artistic work of those who paint pictures are the first tracings of lines; but let the ornamentation of colors come to be added, then only does the beauty of the image also shine forth. It was necessary therefore that the Law transmitted by Moses, which aimed to describe wisely the mystery of Christ, should not designate it by one (only) of the goats and the birds which died and lived all together, lest what was said be considered as a false theatrical scene, but it admitted the immolation in that one alone who suffered and it showed in the other that he was living and sent. The exposition made on this subject does not depart from verisimilitude. Another image still, in my opinion, relates to what I have said. For it is written in the book of Genesis: 'And it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham and said to him: Abraham, Abraham! And he said: Here I am! He said to him: Take your beloved son, whom you love, Isaac, go to the high land and there offer him to me as a holocaust on one of the mountains that I will show you. (Abraham) rose in the morning and saddled his donkey. He took with him two servants and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the holocausts, rose, set out and arrived, on the third day, at the place that God had told him. And Abraham, lifting his eyes, saw the place from afar. And Abraham said to his servants: Stay here with the donkey; I and the child will go up there, we will worship, and we will return to you. Now, Abraham took the wood of the holocaust and loaded it on his son Isaac; he took in hand the fire and the knife, and they went both together<sup><a href="#fn142" id="ref142">142</a></sup>. And further on: 'And there, Abraham built the altar, placed the wood on it, bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar on top of the wood. And Abraham stretched out his hand to take the knife and immolate his son'<sup><a href="#fn143" id="ref143">143</a></sup>. Well then, suppose that someone among us desired to see, painted on a canvas, the story of Abraham, how would the painter have represented it? Would he have represented it on a single (canvas) for all that has been said, or successively in a different attitude, or under a different aspect, the same, in many places — I mean something in this genre: sometimes saddling the donkey and leading the child, escorted by the servants, sometimes again, the donkey remaining below with the servants, while he has loaded the wood on Isaac and holds in hand the knife and the fire, and again in another place, the same, under another aspect, binding the child on top of the wood, the hand armed with a knife to inflict immolation on him? — Yet Abraham would not have appeared entirely other in the different places of the painting, but indeed the same everywhere. The art of the painter accommodates itself to the measure of things. For it would not be verisimilar nor of the order of possibles that we see him put on a single (canvas) all that has been said. The Law was therefore the figure and the type of the realities, which bore in it the truth. Thus therefore, although necessity made intervene two goats and two birds to expound the mystery of Christ, he who was (represented) by the two was however one: as being at once in suffering and outside of suffering, in death and above death, and ascending to heaven as the first fruits<sup><a href="#fn144" id="ref144">144</a></sup> of humanity renewed for incorruptibility. For it is he who reopened for us the road to the heights, and we shall follow him in due time. I will go, he said, indeed, and I will prepare a place for you. And I will return and take you with me, so that where I am, you may be with me<sup><a href="#fn145" id="ref145">145</a></sup>."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">How then, after having omitted all that, O corrupt (man), and having detached from it what pleased you, do you divide, with these two goats and these two birds, the one Christ? Saint Cyril said however clearly that, in this type of the two goats, there are two things which depart from the truth, in this that these goats are of the same species and that they differ in nothing by nature one from the other, and this also that the two goats still serve to designate the one and only Christ. But just as the goats are of the same species without the symbol harming in anything the expression of the truth, and that we do not draw from it the idea of mixture or confusion, and that we do not linger on the shadows (presented) by the type, (so as) not to harm the brilliance of the truth, but that we recognize on the contrary that the Emmanuel results from two realities which are not consubstantial one to the other, from the divinity and the humanity, thus we do not divide either, starting from the two goats, the Christ into two natures. However, on this point also we depart from the type. Saint Cyril said, indeed, in the text which has just been cited, that the truth surpasses the indication (that it gives) and that there are cases where it provides only a partial indication of the things signified. Since therefore, under this respect, he refuses to see a proof in the type, how is it that you, remaining in the shadows in the manner of a Jew, strive to show two Christs? For in the same way, he says, as he who sees Abraham represented multiple times on a painting, does not believe multiple he who is one, thus also he who sees the one Christ represented by the two goats — or by the two birds — because one goat alone does not suffice to render the total image of the reality, does not define in two natures, or (in two) persons or (in two) hypostases, he who is one. How? Hear, indeed, the inspired word of Cyril. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the Scholia<sup><a href="#fn146" id="ref146">146</a></sup>: "He compares Christ to two birds, not as if there were two sons, but because he is one from the two, from the divinity and the humanity, which have assembled for the union."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">You see that he who was designated symbolically by the two birds, escapes in truth division into two, because he is one from the two, from the divinity and the humanity. For, that these two goats were taken by reason of the deficiency of the types and to (specify) the character of an insufficient image: to make everything understood, and not so that we think that the one Christ is divided into two, it is permissible to learn it still with evidence from the holy word of Cyril. FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the sixteenth book of "Worship in Spirit"<sup><a href="#fn147" id="ref147">147</a></sup>: "To him who let his hair grow, the Law ordered to offer after eight days turtledoves and pigeons. Now it has also imposed this to signify that he purifies the impure, understand: Christ. For he is designated by the two: by the turtledove, because he is endowed with a beautiful voice, and by the dove, because he is gentle, while the Law has an embarrassed tongue and is deprived of gentleness: it decrees on the spot punishments against delinquents." And what will you say further here, my dear? That Christ is divided with the types? Which of the natures will you say (is) the turtledove and which the dove? Unless it be clear that the types offer, to the extent possible, only partial significations, and that Christ, otherwise, is indivisible: that he is endowed with a beautiful voice, inasmuch as he is designated by the turtledove, that he embraces the orb of the world by the trumpet of divine preaching — for 'this gospel will be preached in the whole world'<sup><a href="#fn148" id="ref148">148</a></sup> — and that he is gentle, inasmuch as he is signified by the dove — 'Learn, indeed, from me that I am gentle and humble of heart!'<sup><a href="#fn149" id="ref149">149</a></sup>"</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But perhaps you will say: Saint Cyril, in the letter he wrote to Acacius concerning the scapegoat, attacks those who say two sons and two Christs; for my part, I say one unique Christ, one unique Son and Lord, but two natures! But we demonstrate without searching far that he who does not profess one unique nature of the incarnate God Word, but says two natures after the union, logically, by the fact that he says two natures, posits equally two Christs. We have recourse again to what we cited at the beginning of the book. For perhaps it is necessary that we also, before this stupid exposition of chapters, proclaim the same things. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from "That Christ is One" — the treatise is in the form of questions and answers<sup><a href="#fn150" id="ref150">150</a></sup>: "Cyril: Well then, if we say that the nature of the Son is one, although one recognizes it incarnate, it is in any case necessary to say that confusion and mixture occur, since the nature of man is absorbed into it. For what, indeed, is the nature of man in face of the excellence of the divinity? — [Cyril]: my friend, it is rather an extravagance that he utters who says that confusion and mixture occur, if we profess one unique nature of the Son, incarnate and made man. For it is impossible for anyone to prove it by compelling and solid reasons. And if they impose their own will upon us as law, they have known a design which they will not be able to sustain. For we attach ourselves preferably, not to them, but to the inspired Scripture. If they think, moreover, that the nature of man, because it is nothing beside the divine excellence, has necessarily been frustrated and absorbed (by it), as they say themselves, once again we say: You are mistaken, because you ignore the Scriptures, as well as the power of God<sup><a href="#fn151" id="ref151">151</a></sup>. For it was not impossible to the merciful God to show himself supporting the conditions of humanity. And it is this that he indicated to us beforehand, in a figurative manner, instructing Moses and describing, still in the form of a type, the mode of the inhumation. For he rested on a bush in the desert under the aspect of fire; and the fire shone on a plant of modest size, which however was not consumed<sup><a href="#fn152" id="ref152">152</a></sup>. Moses was struck with stupor at this vision. For how was the wood not ill-chosen (as support) for the fire? A matter easily inflammable resisted the violence of the flame! But the fact was, as I have said, the symbol of the mysteries which made appear the divine nature of the Word supporting the conditions of humanity, when he would wish it; for there is nothing impossible for him. — I ask: Know well that they do not consent to nourish thoughts that concord with those! — Cyril: Their sentence is therefore refuted, and it is beyond dispute that they confess two Christs and two sons."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Here is clearly demonstrated that to say two natures after the union is nothing other than to say two sons. That the in examples and types that one must not stop at everything, but choose only what is useful and reject what is not in accordance with the truth, which the type came to manifest—as the very wise Cyril did concerning the two goats and the two birds—this is also what John, who was bishop of Constantinople, testifies to us. FROM SAINT JOHN, BISHOP OF CONSTANTINOPLE, from the Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans<sup><a href="#fn153" id="ref153">153</a></sup>: "It is equally necessary to observe this everywhere: that one must take the examples, not in their entirety, but, drawing from them what is useful for the proposed goal, leave aside the rest. Therefore, just as when Scripture says: 'I lay down and slept like a lion'<sup><a href="#fn154" id="ref154">154</a></sup>, we understand it of his invincibility and majesty, and not of his ferocity or some other characteristic of the lion; and just as when it says: 'I will strike them like a bear that hesitates to go to its punishment'<sup><a href="#fn155" id="ref155">155</a></sup>, and when it says: 'Our God is a consuming fire'<sup><a href="#fn156" id="ref156">156</a></sup>, it expresses destruction by punishment, it is in this manner that it is henceforth necessary to take, here also, 'the clay', 'the potter' and 'the vessels'. And when, continuing, he says: 'Does not the potter have power over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?'<sup><a href="#fn157" id="ref157">157</a></sup>, let no one think that Paul declared this with regard to creation, or concerning a necessity (imposed on) the soul, but rather concerning the power and variety of providence. If we do not take it thus, many inconveniences will follow. For, supposing that it is here a question (of a necessity imposed on) the soul, (God) would be the author of what is good and what is not, man would be presented as devoid of any (proper) causality and Paul would be in conflict with himself, he who everywhere crowns the will."</p>

If, indeed, the two natures being united, you had also said that Christ is one and only from them, you would have concluded by way of reasoning what is, considered as a whole, the quality of the one who resulted from them.

And how would that not oppose your assertions? For you do not admit that one distributes the statements between the two persons or hypostases! — But, my dear, I will say that we have written in the chapters: 'If anyone distributes the words between two persons or hypostases, and attributes some to the man recognized separately outside the God Word, and the others, which befit God, to the Word alone issued from God the Father, let him be anathema!'<sup><a href="#fn162" id="ref162">162</a></sup> The distinction of the words, we have not suppressed it in any way, although we have refused to distribute them between the Son alone, the Word issued from the Father, considered separately, and on the other hand the man, who would be recognized separately as the Son issued from the woman."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">NEW APOLOGY. — Just as we recognize the difference of the natures from which Christ is one, but by no means their separation—for we no longer say that there are two natures after the union—so we also recognize the difference of the words, and no longer a separation and a division which would consist in this: that certain words would be formulated by one nature and the others by the other nature. We establish, indeed, that all are formulated by one alone, those that befit God and those that are human; for we believe that there is one unique nature of the incarnate God Word. But if we divided the Emmanuel and said that he is two natures after the union, the words would also necessarily be divided with them and would be distributed separately and respectively between the two natures. It is realizing this that the adversary has, once again, in his malicious cunning, amputated the chapter, so that the difference of the words, resting on two natures, would be understood as a separation. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the same letter to Acacius, what the adversary cut out<sup><a href="#fn163" id="ref163">163</a></sup>: "For the nature of the Word is manifestly one and we understand it incarnate and made man, as I have said previously."</p>

For the nature of the incarnate Word being unique, we rightly say that all are formulated by one alone concerning one being. By what, indeed, would they be divided, seeing that the duality is suppressed after the union? Besides, we say, this text has been violently altered, and in a heretical sense. Whereas in the authentic writing, (the text) presents itself thus: "...that he is God and man and in the same", he, on the other hand, produced in the chapter: "... that he is God and man at once and (that he is) in him", to make of Christ a theophoric man, in whom the Word possesses a sort of dwelling. That recognizing the difference of the words does not entail their division (which would rest) on the two natures, (we show) by resorting once again to the words of Saint Cyril, which I cited in the thirtieth chapter and which were subtly taken by the adversary. FROM THE SAME SAINT CYRIL, from the same letter to Acacius<sup><a href="#fn174" id="ref174">174</a></sup>: "We have in no way suppressed the distinction of the words, although we have refused to distribute them between the Son taken apart, the Word issued from the Father, and the man taken apart, who would be recognized as the Son issued from the woman.

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — Once again, here also, he amputated the text. Here it is: "Refer them rather to the one unique Son, that is to say to the incarnate God Word." Now, he did not do it by chance, but by adherence to the vain terminology of Nestorius who also recognizes one unique Son, not by professing one unique nature of the incarnate God Word, but by declaring the name of sonship common to the two natures, so that, by that very fact, the words are proper to one unique Son, but are distributed separately between the natures. FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS, concerning the text: "It is not of my own accord that I have spoken, but the Father, who sent me, has himself prescribed to me what I must say and what I must express<sup><a href="#fn179" id="ref179">179</a></sup>."<sup><a href="#fn180" id="ref180">180</a></sup> — "When therefore we maintain the division of the natures, in consideration (of the conditions) of humility, do not be astonished at it! But there is this that certain (things) are recognized as proper to the divinity and others proper to the humanity, without the person of the Son being divided into two, following the blasphemies they impute to us. For the Son is one, the Christ is one, but the natures are two in one unique person according to sonship: the sonship is one, but the natures are two, as I have said." AND FURTHER ON<sup><a href="#fn181" id="ref181">181</a></sup>: [NESTORIUS] "One cannot call Son either the God Word taken separately, nor indeed the humanity taken separately, for that would be nothing other than establishing two sons. But the name of sonship has become common to the two natures. You have said the Son? You have indicated the two natures. You have said the Christ? You have separated none of the natures in the sonship." FROM THE SAME, from another treatise, "On Patience"<sup><a href="#fn182" id="ref182">182</a></sup>: [NESTORIUS] "She who said: 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'<sup><a href="#fn183" id="ref183">183</a></sup>, it was the nature of humanity, O sage!"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Ideas conformable to these, drawn from the impious Tome of Leo, which the Synod of Chalcedon confirmed<sup><a href="#fn184" id="ref184">184</a></sup>: [LEO] "It is not of the same nature to say: 'The Father and I are one!'<sup><a href="#fn185" id="ref185">185</a></sup> and to say: 'My Father is greater than I!'<sup><a href="#fn186" id="ref186">186</a></sup>"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Behold, it clearly emerges from these citations that those who say two natures after the union, admit according to a division the distinction of the words, in such a way that each of the natures formulates, apart from itself, the words that befit it and are proportioned to it. As for those who profess one unique nature of the incarnate God Word, they declare: "We believe that all, indistinctly, were said by him", limiting themselves to distinguishing which are the words that befit God and which are those that befit man. There are, moreover, those who accept neither distinction nor difference with the division they involve, given that it is in relation to the same that there are in the words what befits God and what befits humanity. But we have expounded these (ideas) in detail above, in our long dissertation against the eighth chapter<sup><a href="#fn187" id="ref187">187</a></sup>. We refer the reader there again so that what was said there may come back to his memory.</p>

Your Perfection has not been unaware that they have spread the stain of Apollinarian opinion on our letters: I would have said that the holy body of Christ is deprived of a soul, and that there was mixture, or confusion, or amalgamation, or transformation of the Word into flesh, or even passage of the flesh into the nature of the Word; in this way nothing would be maintained in its integrity, nor would it be anymore what it is. They thought moreover that I associated myself with the blasphemies of Arius, because they do not want, themselves, to recognize the distinction of the words and to say that there are among them some that befit God, that others are human, befitting rather the economy linked to the flesh. That I am, for my part, safe from such allegations, Your Perfection could attest to others. It was necessary however to defend ourselves, with regard to those who were scandalized. And that is why I wrote to his<sup><a href="#fn189" id="ref189">189</a></sup> piety that I have never shared the opinions of Arius and Apollinarius and that I do not say either that the Word of God was transformed into flesh, nor that the nature of the flesh was changed into the nature of the divinity; for the Word of God is immutable and unalterable; the inverse is equally impossible. And I have never suppressed the distinction of the words either, but I know that the Lord speaks both as befits God and in a human manner, because he is, in the same, both God and man."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — Often (already) I have made the apology for this. Although we confess one unique nature of the incarnate God Word, we do not say however that the elements from which the Emmanuel is (constituted), the divinity and the humanity, were transformed. Now you, following your vain opinion, think that absence of change gives rise to separation. But we, advancing by the royal road and believing that there is no necessity to fall into one of the nets (that are stretched for us), we cite again against you the texts of Cyril.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">FROM SAINT CYRIL, [from what he wrote] against the impious Diodore<sup><a href="#fn190" id="ref190">190</a></sup>: "Hence, although no one says that he who is of the seed of David came forth from the essence of God the Father, like the Monogenes himself, however, the virtue of the union, which took place without confusion or change, suppresses the separation. He, on the contrary, because the flesh, according to the reason of (its) natural quality, is not the Monogenes, and inversely the Word is not the flesh, separates them wrongly and posits that they are one other and another and two sons, granting them at most a conjunction of complaisance. Unless perhaps he considers that some are unreasonable, because they do not make the flesh pass by change into the nature of the Word, and that inversely they do not lower the Word [to consubstantiality with the flesh which was united to him... (?)]<sup><a href="#fn191" id="ref191">191</a></sup>. As for us, believing that it is stupidity to think thus, we say that the Word, taking flesh from the Holy Virgin, came forth man from it, and not that he was in a man or that he appears to have assumed a man. But he is rather one unique and same Son, so that he may be equally recognized as issued from the essence of God the Father according to divinity, and from us according to humanity."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the second letter to Succensus<sup><a href="#fn192" id="ref192">192</a></sup>: "It has therefore also escaped those who introduce confusion into what is exact, that the nature of the incarnate God Word is in truth one. For the Son, who is naturally and truly the Word born of the Father in an ineffable manner, is one; and even if, in assuming flesh, not deprived of soul, but rather endowed with an intelligent soul, he came forth, man, from the woman, he is not for that reason divided into two persons and two sons, but he remained one, not however without the flesh nor outside the body, but (this) was his own thanks to the indissoluble union. Now, he who says that, does not convey, in any way whatsoever, either amalgamation or confusion or something similar: that does not follow from any compelling reason. How so? Although we say the Monogenes is one, the Son of God, who became incarnate and made man, he is not for that reason the result of a confusion, as it seems to them. For neither did the nature of the Word pass into the nature of the flesh, nor that of the flesh into that of the Word. But each of them remaining and being recognized in the inherent property of its nature, according to the exposition we have just given, the ineffable and inexplicable union shows us a unique nature of the Son, but, as I have said, incarnate."</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[36.] THIRTY-SIXTH CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME SAINT CYRIL, from the memorandum, or letter, to Succensus, Bishop of Diocaesarea, of which here is the beginning: "I have read the memorandum sent by your holiness..."<sup><a href="#fn193" id="ref193">193</a></sup> — "Since some calumniously impute to us the Apollinarian opinion and say: If you say that the Word issued from God the Father, who became incarnate and was made man, is one unique nature thanks to a rigorous and close union, perhaps you also imagine this and have stopped to think that there was a confusion or amalgamation of the Word with the body, [or even a change of the body] into the nature of the divinity. For this reason therefore, we say quite wisely, rejecting the calumny, that the Word who is issued from God the Father united himself in an incomprehensible and inexpressible manner to a body endowed with an intelligent soul and came forth, man, from the woman, becoming like us, not by a transformation of nature, but rather thanks to the benevolence of the economy."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — What I have produced concerning the preceding chapter was also sufficient to make it appear that the thought of Saint Cyril is sound and complete: how he confesses that the God Word was united to a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul, (how) he declares that his incarnate nature is unique and escapes the reproach of atheistic change, of confusion or amalgamation of the natures as well as of (their) entirely impious separation. But I think it is also necessary to cite, in their sequence, the texts that follow the chapter: he has voluntarily amputated some and, after having cut up others like the pieces of a tunic, he has put them together on his own account... or rather by disregarding any connection!</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[37-40.] CHAPTERS CITED IN THE LIBELLUS UP TO THE FORTIETH.</span> FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the same letter to Succensus; the texts that follow the (preceding) chapter, which the adversary has successively and voluntarily cut up and divided into many chapters<sup><a href="#fn194" id="ref194">194</a></sup>: "For he wanted to become man, without ceasing to be God by nature, but, while lowering himself to our measures and taking the form of a slave, he remained, even so, in the excellence of divinity and in the sovereignty that is natural to him. Uniting therefore in an ineffable and incomprehensible manner to the holy flesh, endowed with an intelligent soul, the Word who is issued from God the Father, without confusion, without change, without conversion, we confess one unique Son, Christ and Lord, who, the same, is God and man, not one and another, but one and the same, who is and is recognized as both this and that. He speaks, indeed, sometimes as man, according to the economy, in a human manner, and sometimes, as God, he pronounces words with the power that befits God. But, scrutinizing wisely the mode of the economy linked to the flesh and examining precisely the mystery of the Word issued from God the Father, incarnate and made man, we also say this: it is not from his divine nature that he fashioned this holy body for himself, but he rather took it from the Virgin. Otherwise, how would he have become man, if he had not put on a human body? Considering therefore, as I have said, the mode of the inhumation, we see that the two natures assembled with one another in an indissoluble union, without confusion or change. For the flesh is flesh, and not divinity, even when it became the flesh of the Word; likewise the Word is God, and not flesh, even when he made the flesh his own by the economy. When therefore we consider this, we do no prejudice to the coming together of the one with the other into a unity, which we say was realized from the two natures; on the other hand, after the union, we do not separate the natures from one another and we do not split the one who is one and indivisible into two sons, but we say one unique Son and, as the Fathers have declared, one unique nature of the God Word incarnate."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Behold in its integrity the thought of Saint Cyril and his complete exposition. It follows that from the union of the two natures or by reason of the very reunion of the one to the other, one unique nature of the God Word incarnate was formed. This is what is implied by the fact that the natures are not separated from one another after the union and that the indivisible is not divided into two. These passages being cited in this way in their sequence, where do you find henceforth a thirty-seventh, thirty-eighth, thirty-ninth and fortieth chapter? For in this citation they hold together, receiving their cohesion, devoid of your astute cutting. You have arranged them here and there, in a ridiculous way, like the jackdaw in the fable did with the feathers!<sup><a href="#fn195" id="ref195">195</a></sup></p>

We are, indeed, composed of a soul and a body and we see two natures: one, that of the body, the other, that of the soul."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — If you had been permitted to bury the books of Saint Cyril and to forbid their complete reading to the orthodox, perhaps this miserable and arbitrary exposition of chapters, this manifest plunder of holy and inspired words, would have had a reason to exist! But if the treatises of Saint Cyril arise everywhere under heaven, and if his words and sentences, intervening in the debate, censure your foolish and arrogant temerity, why do you strike in vain in the air<sup><a href="#fn197" id="ref197">197</a></sup> and fight in vain? For behold, wanting to demonstrate that Cyril said two natures after the union, you are not content with cutting up his texts, but you overturn their order, and you have cited first those which were last in the order, to prejudice what had been happily written. It is that, before the present chapter, it would have been necessary to produce the following one, which I also report, for it suffices to cite the texts together and in their authentic sequence to refute your perversity.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[42.] FORTY-SECOND CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME SAINT CYRIL, from the same first letter to Succensus<sup><a href="#fn198" id="ref198">198</a></sup>: "Thus, insofar as it is necessary to perceive in thought and with the eyes of the soul alone in what manner the Monogenes became man, we say that there are two natures that united, but that there is only one unique Son, Christ and Lord."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — For whom, even among the most inconsiderate, does it not clearly emerge from these words, that the Saint truly recognized that the unique nature of the God Word incarnate cannot be divided into two? For it is only by scrutinizing through precise consideration the (elements) from which the Emmanuel is (constituted), that we say there are two natures that united; on the other hand, by welcoming in our mind the idea of union, we deduce that one unique nature of the God Word incarnate was formed. For the hypostatic union signifies these two points: that there was a reunion of two realities, or of several, into one same thing, and, because those have been reunited into one unique being, that this one is no longer dissolved henceforth into the (elements) from which it is (constituted). Indeed, these (elements) which are united naturally, do not subsist in the isolation of their (own) subsistence, but they are manifestly in one unique nature and one unique hypostasis: they only show from what the unique being is constituted, because they were united without confusion, while escaping division into two or several.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">(In proof) that it is indeed so, I cite the words of Saint Cyril, those which he cut off here, as well as those which he cited in the preceding chapter, which, in order, were subsequent, and which, thus (presented), he did not leave to the freedom of plunder. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the first letter to Succensus, what was cut off by the adversary and what, in the order, was joined to it<sup><a href="#fn199" id="ref199">199</a></sup>: "We say that there are two natures that were united, but that there is only one unique Christ, Son and Lord, the Word of God, who became incarnate and was made man. And if this is fitting, let us take as an example our composite which makes us men. Now we are composed of a soul and a body, and we see two natures, one, that of the body, the other, that of the soul; but man is one from the two, thanks to the union. And the fact that he is composed of two natures does not make us think that he who is one is two men, but one unique man, as I have said, by the composition of soul and body." FROM THE SAME, from the second letter to Succensus, an analogous text<sup><a href="#fn200" id="ref200">200</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "And let the man that we are serve us again as an example. For we also conceive concerning him two natures, one, that of the soul, the other, that of the body. However, while thus distinguishing by very fine considerations, or grasping a difference by imaginations of the mind, we do not set the natures apart from one another and we do not let the power of division exercise itself totally upon them, but we understand that they are of one unique being, so that henceforth the two are no longer two, but that by the two is formed one unique living being."</p>

But we, producing what you have cited, reproach an audacious plunder. FROM SAINT CYRIL, what was cut off by the adversary: "For if we suppress that the unique and only Christ, indivisible after the union, is from two natures, and from (natures) different, those who combat orthodoxy will say: If the whole in him is only one nature, how did he become man and make the flesh his own?"</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[44.] FORTY-FOURTH CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the same first letter to Succensus<sup><a href="#fn203" id="ref203">203</a></sup>: "Following the transgression of the commandment by Adam, human nature had contracted corruption and the spirit in us was harassed by the desires of the flesh, or the natural movements, which had assailed the nature. We say therefore that it was necessary for our redemption, we who are on earth, that the Word of God became man, to appropriate human flesh subjected to corruption and suffering from concupiscence, and, — because he is life and life-giving, — to destroy in it the corruption and repress the natural movements, we mean those of concupiscence. For thus would sin die in it."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — It is first fitting to observe that the adversary, by excessive foolishness, thought that Saint Cyril needed, to amend himself, the wisdom that he himself possesses. Indeed, whereas the Saint had said: "the natural movements", he, as a sage, added: "those which had assailed the nature", so that one might believe that the Saint had said that sin was natural, if he, the adversary, had not made this addition! But it clearly [appeared] that in [this] too he did not escape the [reproach] of ignorance. It is indeed a natural movement of man to desire food and drink; but when this leads to intemperance, (the man) suffers from gluttony. It is also inherent in us, by nature, to desire virtuous actions; [but when] "this (desire) was transformed" [into concupiscence, it sank into] fornication. Thus these movements are natural, while the change which resulted [...] from sin is accidental. When therefore Saint Cyril gives the name of illness to the concupiscence of the natural movements, how would he have considered sin as natural? For illness [belongs] to things that come from outside and not to those that (man) possesses naturally. And it is thus that he says: "it suffered from concupiscence", and again: "to repress the natural movements, we mean those of concupiscence."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But let us rise to the object presently proposed. The miserable one, separating the unique Christ into two and God the Word from the man who was joined to him, still thinks, following the terminology of Nestorius and Theodore, that (the Word) repressed (in the man) the movements of concupiscence and that he rendered him perfect by way of progress, and that these (advantages) did not come to our race through him. There was assuredly in him no trace of sin, for, while being truly man, he was at the same time God by essence and it is by essence that he possessed in himself immutability and impeccability. And that is why "he did not commit sin and no deceit was found in his mouth"<sup><a href="#fn204" id="ref204">204</a></sup>. It is fitting, on the other hand, to cite also the words cut off here: thanks to them we will perceive his vanity and his perverse astuteness. FROM THE SAME SAINT CYRIL, from the first letter to Succensus, what was cut off by the adversary<sup><a href="#fn205" id="ref205">205</a></sup>: "We remember that the blessed Paul also called law of sin the natural movements which are in us<sup><a href="#fn206" id="ref206">206</a></sup>. Therefore, it is because human flesh became that of the Word, that it ceased to be subjected to corruption; and it is because, as God, he knows no sin, that, when he drew it to himself and made it appear his own, as I have said, it also ceased to be tormented by concupiscence. And it is not for himself that the Monogenes, the Word of God, arranged this, — for always he is what he is, — but evidently for us. For, if we were subjected to evils which came upon us following the transgression of the commandment by Adam, of all necessity we are also (subjected) to what was realized by Christ, that is to say incorruptibility and the death of sin." [......] "He has, (he says), neglected similar things, as being common, and has granted us no help, [......]. He who has dared to spin such talk, does he then still profess that he thinks that he who was born of the Holy Virgin is really God? Is it found that he accepts in his mind that the Word became flesh, according to the word of John<sup><a href="#fn207" id="ref207">207</a></sup>? It is, (according to him), by inclinations flowing from the will, I say, that he tended to virtuous actions and that he exercised himself to turn away from evil. He was irreproachable, because the Word assisted him, and he was always subjected to the necessity of not [ceasing] to be (applied) to the desire of all that is good. Also he says, he too, with the divine Paul: It is by the grace of God that he tasted death<sup><a href="#fn208" id="ref208">208</a></sup>. [......]." AND FURTHER ON: "What concerning our Savior to all [......] compared blasphemy [...] intolerable. For he possesses, yes, he possesses in himself the good, essentially and in an inalienable manner; he possesses it in himself, being God by nature. Although the Word became flesh, there is (in him) the stability inherent to all that befits God and he does not admit undergoing the shadow of a change<sup><a href="#fn209" id="ref209">209</a></sup>. And that is why equally, having become man, he made appear in himself, the first, I say, the nature of man superior to sin, to renew us also in this state by a regeneration. It was not likely, indeed, that, because he was united to a flesh, he could fail in the firmness that he held, I say, naturally for the good. He rather remained what he was, what he is and will be." AND FURTHER ON: "Therefore, let him not be considered as a man who, by inclinations flowing from acts of will, directed his gaze towards what is fitting, to concern himself with the good, but rather as a God, in the firmness that is natural to him and which only he knows." Let the adversary therefore not formulate injustice towards God, by making him appear to us as an ordinary man.</p>

And on the other hand, to persuade those who saw him that, independently of the fact that he is man, he was also God, he performed divine signs, commanded the sea<sup><a href="#fn215" id="ref215">215</a></sup>, raised the dead and accomplished other prodigies. He also bore the cross, so that, undergoing death in the flesh, and not in the nature of divinity, he became the firstborn from the dead<sup><a href="#fn216" id="ref216">216</a></sup>, opened for human nature the road to incorruptibility, and so that, depopulating hell, he took pity on the souls that were detained there."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — This chapter, (considered) by itself, is fitting to God and does not make, as the adversary had thought, a state of separation. For, by the fact that (Cyril) said: "He gave himself over to sleep, to trouble and anguish", he made it clearly understood that it is God who gave himself over to undergo that in what is naturally apt to suffer, that is to say in the flesh. But he, wanting to remove these (weaknesses) from the God Word, cut off the text which precedes the chapter and which is the following. FROM THE SAME SAINT CYRIL, what precedes the chapter and which the adversary cut off<sup><a href="#fn217" id="ref217">217</a></sup>: "Thus therefore he became man and did not assume a man, according to the view of Nestorius. And so that one may believe that, in becoming man, he remained what he was, that is to say God by nature, it is said, for that very reason, that he was hungry and that he was weary from the journey; on the other hand, he also gave himself over to sleep, to trouble and anguish."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And while Saint Cyril recognizes these things as proper to the incarnate God as well as those that befit God, the Tome of Leo, which the Synod of Chalcedon confirmed iniquitously, attributes all human things to the man considered in isolation, as the divine things to God taken separately. FROM THE IMPIOUS TOME OF LEO, a text contrary to these (assertions) of Cyril<sup><a href="#fn218" id="ref218">218</a></sup>: "Indeed, to be hungry and thirsty, to be weary and to sleep are manifestly the proper of man. On the contrary, to feed five thousand men with five loaves<sup><a href="#fn219" id="ref219">219</a></sup>, to give the Samaritan woman a living water which would henceforth, when she drew from it, mean she would no longer thirst<sup><a href="#fn220" id="ref220">220</a></sup>, to walk, with dry feet, on the surface of the sea<sup><a href="#fn221" id="ref221">221</a></sup> and to calm the agitation of the waves by rebuking the unleashed waves<sup><a href="#fn222" id="ref222">222</a></sup>, are without contradiction the proper of God."</p>

<p class="paragraph">[46-49.] That is for what concerns this chapter. For the chapters which come in the interval up to the fiftieth, it is superfluous to undertake a criticism which would be vain. For we too do not say that the most holy body of Christ was transformed, neither before the resurrection nor after the resurrection, and we have never thought that it...was devoid of a soul or spirit, although we believe that the nature of the God Word incarnate is unique.</p>

But since the integrity required by humanity and by our essence is marked by the fact that we have said 'incarnate', let them be silent, those who lean on a reed!<sup><a href="#fn229" id="ref229">229</a></sup>"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — Oh, this complete folly! Whereas everywhere he has cut off this holy formula, that one must profess a unique nature of the God Word incarnate, and he has turned away from it in the thought that it introduced mixture or gave ground to those who falsely declare that the body is devoid of soul and spirit, here he is now citing words of Saint Cyril which make use of this formula and clear him of such calumnies. If therefore this seems fitting to you, confess with us that the nature of the God Word incarnate is unique; especially, indeed, since in saying 'incarnate', we mark the essence of humanity, not however in a separate subsistence, but in unity with the Word, so that no one may imagine from this to say two natures after the union. For this is contrary to the confession of a unique nature of the God Word incarnate. Now this is what the star of the Church, Athanasius, proposed to us as law in a writing, and these are the holy words he left us as the foundation of the faith. FROM SAINT ATHANASIUS, from the book "On the Inhumanation of the Word"<sup><a href="#fn230" id="ref230">230</a></sup>: "We confess that the Son of God, who was begotten and came forth from the Father before the ages, and at the end of times was born for our salvation from the Virgin Mary according to the flesh, — as the divine apostle teaches by these words: 'When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman'<sup><a href="#fn231" id="ref231">231</a></sup>, — is also, the same, Son of God and God according to the Spirit and Son of Man according to the flesh. But the only Son is not two natures, one adorable and one not adorable, but a unique nature of the God Word incarnate and adored with his flesh in a unique adoration."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Here it is clear that he refuses to say that the only Son is two natures. For duality separates the flesh from the Word, adorable according to its nature, since it establishes that the flesh is not to be adored. But once a unique nature of the God Word incarnate is confessed, it is adored in a unique adoration, because of the Word who united it to himself hypostatically.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[52.] FIFTY-SECOND CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the second letter to Succensus<sup><a href="#fn232" id="ref232">232</a></sup>: "It is very exactly and intelligently that your Perfection expounds the doctrine on the suffering of the Savior, affirming that it is not the Monogenes, the Son of God, in as much as he is recognized God, who suffered in his nature what is proper to the body, but that he suffered rather in his earthly nature. It was necessary, indeed, of all necessity that these two facts be maintained in him who is in truth a unique Son: and that he did not suffer in his divinity, and that he was said to have suffered in his humanity. For it is his flesh that suffered."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — This man, at once perverse and impious, thinks, from the fact that the Saint says: "For it is his flesh that suffered", that he removes from the Word the body that suffered. Now it is known to everyone, even the simplest, that it is to him to whom the flesh belongs that the suffering is justly also attributed. Indeed, if he were not yet incarnate, let him not be said to have suffered in the flesh. But if he made the passible body his own, — for he was incarnate and made man, — we attribute to him the suffering, although he remained impassible in his own nature. We have, moreover, expounded this with much precision above, in speaking of the fourth chapter: we again urge the reader to read it<sup><a href="#fn233" id="ref233">233</a></sup>. It pleases us, on the other hand, to cite also the words of the chapter left remaining, which the adversary intentionally cut off<sup><a href="#fn234" id="ref234">234</a></sup>. We learn from them, indeed, both that the Word remained impassible in his own nature and that he is not foreign to the suffering, because the body that suffered is not foreign to him. Now we too do not say that the unique Christ is two natures: we know, indeed, that the same suffered according to humanity and that, on the contrary, from the fact that he is God, he remained, the same, above suffering. [FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the same second letter to Succensus, what follows the chapter and which the adversary cut off]<sup><a href="#fn235" id="ref235">235</a></sup>: "But they believe furthermore that we introduce by this what they call the 'passibility of the divinity'. And without taking account of the economy, they attempt on the contrary, in their perverse cunning, to report the suffering on the man taken separately: they foolishly institute a defective piety, according to which it is not the Word of God who, for having shed his blood for us, is believed to be the Savior, but it is rather a man, recognized as Son separately and apart from him, who is said to have accomplished such a task. Now to think in this way shakes the whole plan of the economy linked to the flesh and openly lowers our divine mystery to the level of the work of a man. They do not consider either that he who is issued from the Jews according to the flesh, that is to say he who is of the seed of Jesse and David, the blessed Paul has called Christ, Lord of glory<sup><a href="#fn236" id="ref236">236</a></sup> and God blessed in the ages and above all<sup><a href="#fn237" id="ref237">237</a></sup>, declaring that it was necessary, with regard to the body of the Word which was hung on the wood, to attribute to him, to him also, for that very reason, the cross." After which, in the form of objections from those who say two natures after the union, he introduces the exposition in this manner<sup><a href="#fn238" id="ref238">238</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "I also learn that another thing is in question. He, it is said then, who declares that the Lord suffered in the flesh, removes the suffering from the reason and the will. If, on the other hand, he declares, so that the suffering becomes voluntary, that he suffered with his intelligent soul, there is nothing that prevents saying that he suffered in the nature of humanity. Now, if this is exact, how would we not grant that two natures subsisted without separation after the union? Hence, if one declares: 'Christ therefore suffered for us in the flesh'<sup><a href="#fn239" id="ref239">239</a></sup>, one says nothing other than this: Christ therefore suffered for us in our nature." To this (respond the words) of Saint Cyril which follow<sup><a href="#fn240" id="ref240">240</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "This objection is no less directed against those who say that the nature of the incarnate Son is unique, and it is by seeking to make the inanity of this principle appear that they strive everywhere to say that the two natures have subsisted. But it escaped them that all the elements to which it is proper to be distinguished other than by the sole consideration of the spirit, necessarily separate from one another to be, apart and isolated, in a state of diversity." And it is after having omitted all this, that the adversary produces another chapter cut from what follows.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — Again, here also, it suffices to cite the words he cut off, which accuse those who divide Christ into two natures after the union. I urge, however, the listeners or he who reads this to recall to memory what we have expounded in the three or four chapters which precede this one. It has been indeed clearly demonstrated in all these (passages) that the nature of the God Word incarnate is unique, and that it is impossible to say two natures after the union. FROM SAINT CYRIL, the words which follow the chapter and which the adversary cut off<sup><a href="#fn244" id="ref244">244</a></sup>: "The inspired Scripture saying therefore: 'He suffered in the flesh'<sup><a href="#fn245" id="ref245">245</a></sup>, it is preferable that we also express ourselves in this way rather than by 'in the nature of humanity', although this expression, — especially if certain ones do not formulate it with bad intention, — does not harm in any way the reason of the mysteries. For what is the nature of humanity if not a flesh endowed with a rational soul? And we say that the Lord 'suffered in the flesh'. It is therefore in a manner quite superfluous that they say: 'he suffered in the nature of humanity', and separate this from the Word and posit it isolated, outside (of him), so that they are recognized as two, and that the Word, issued from God the Father, is not (recognized as) unique, incarnate and made man."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">That is for what concerns this (chapter). As for the fifty-fifth and fifty-sixth chapters, which are connected in the sequence of the exposition, but which have been separated by him, I will make a common and continuous apology for them.</p>

And from the fact that he is said to have been united, he is in no way the result of a confusion, but rather 'becomes', in assuming something else. We affirm therefore that the Word issued from the Father 'became', in taking a holy body provided with a soul, and that, being truly united to it without confusion, he came forth, man, from the womb, and that, even in this state, he remained true God."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — We also profess with him, that the Word united to himself from the womb a body endowed with an intelligent soul, apart from all change, confusion, or alteration. However we do not recognize adhering by half to the teachings of Saint Cyril, but we know who is the one who was formed from this union, that the nature of the God Word incarnate is unique, that the Son is unique from the two natures after the union. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the first letter to Succensus<sup><a href="#fn248" id="ref248">248</a></sup>: "But after the union we do not separate the natures one from the other and we do not split into two sons him who is one and indivisible, but we say one unique Son and, as the Fathers have said, a unique nature of the God Word incarnate."</p>

And this will be clarified by the intervention of the words of Saint Cyril himself. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the same apology of the first anathematism, what the adversary cut off<sup><a href="#fn251" id="ref251">251</a></sup>: "He ought to have pleased himself to make a precise and complete exposition on this subject. It must however be noted now: here, indeed, in explaining here very clearly the union, he declares that God is not apart from human nature, and he professes furthermore to recognize that Christ is unique thanks to the union, that is to say the same, at once God and man.

And this is also, I believe, the opinion of Theodoret, who says that God is not separated from human nature, and that humanity is not known independently of divinity. Hence, it is not independently of the hypostases, we say, that the forms of slave<sup><a href="#fn253" id="ref253">253</a></sup> and of God united, and we do not posit either that an ordinary man, honored only by an equality of dignity, was attached to God according to relations of friendship, but, as I have said, that the Son of God, the Monogenes, truly 'became', in taking a flesh united to him, endowed with a rational soul."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — If you had accepted the hypostatic union, which makes mention of a transcendent reunion of the natures and which is safe from confusion, why did you not show earlier, when you undertook to institute the defense of the definition he had established, that the synod of Chalcedon had professed it? Here, indeed, is Theodoret, the president of the very synod, pretexting the mixture (it entails), rejecting the hypostatic union, because it prevents us from confessing that Christ is unique in two natures. He said it, indeed, in the criticism of the present second chapter in these terms. From the miserable and impious Theodoret, from the criticism of the second anathematism<sup><a href="#fn254" id="ref254">254</a></sup>: "We confess one unique Christ, giving faith to the teachings of the apostles, and we call him, the same, because of the union, God and man.

And if he is, the same, both God and man, it will be fitting and irreproachable that he utters all together words that suit either God or humanity<sup><a href="#fn264" id="ref264">264</a></sup>: his divine and ineffable nature is in no way diminished with respect to the greatness of the Father by the fact that he expresses himself in a human manner, nor is faith in the economy linked to the flesh refused, when, besides being God, he is also proclaimed to have become man like us. Everything, therefore, is of the unique Christ, what suits God and what is human. For if the Word who issued from God the Father had not become man, he would not speak, like us, in a human manner. But if it is true that he partook of blood and flesh like us<sup><a href="#fn265" id="ref265">265</a></sup>, and that he was made in all things like his brothers<sup><a href="#fn266" id="ref266">266</a></sup>, it is evident that they act in a completely senseless way by ridiculing the splendid work of the economy, not accepting a human word and striving to attribute to another Son, taken separately, to the form of a slave, as they say, what in the words, with regard to the economy, suits the state of humiliation."

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — Once again here, by amputating the words cited before the chapter and those that follow it, he thinks to show that Saint Cyril is in agreement with the impure opinion of Nestorius. For behold, he too says that the divine signs were accomplished as through an intermediary organ. To which we say wisely: one thing is, while separating the hypostases (and arranging them) isolated and one apart from the other, to declare that Jesus was incited to action by the God Word, as a man who is other than him, and that he thereby became the organ of the divinity, like a tool of iron handled by an artisan; and another thing is to say that the God Word was hypostatically united to a flesh and that, as through an organ, he accomplished the divine signs through the body, once it was united to him, just as one can also see the soul of man that we are acting through its body, as through an instrument naturally linked to it. This is clearly shown by these citations.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS, from the treatise entitled: "Why the Law [...]"<sup><a href="#fn271" id="ref271">271</a></sup> — "God comes to the aid of the despair of nature and creates as it were a new beginning of humanity. For he renews Adam from the Virgin. The second Adam, indeed, became a life-giving Spirit<sup><a href="#fn272" id="ref272">272</a></sup> and a subject of admiration for the race of those who believe in him. He it is who, coming without being a sinner to have fulfilled the precept (?)<sup><a href="#fn273" id="ref273">273</a></sup>, appeared in a flesh as the organ of the divinity, from which he is in no way separated, who destroyed the condemnation of the world caused by one by a justice operated by one<sup><a href="#fn274" id="ref274">274</a></sup>."

Now he had knowledge of the economy, but not of [the essence] of him who dispenses it, the absolutely immutable essence of him who dispenses it; for the work does not transform the nature of the artisan."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">FROM CYRIL, [...]<sup><a href="#fn277" id="ref277">277</a></sup>: "Some had set themselves to struggle no longer accepting henceforth to confess that Christ is God, but rather the organ, or the vessel of the divinity, and a man bearing God. And what is not found that is not outside such assertions?" FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the second tome against the blasphemies of Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn278" id="ref278">278</a></sup>: "However, you affirm, as is fitting, that the Word used the body as an organ. Now if you say a unique Son and a unique hypostasis, that of the Word, incarnate, it is not he who becomes the organ of the divinity; rather, he uses his own body as an organ, as the soul of man (does) of his own body. Hence confess one, without separating the natures, while knowing and understanding that the reason of the flesh is other and that what suits it alone is proper to the divinity elsewhere. For we do not say that the flesh became the divinity of the Word, but rather (that it became) divine, since it is his.

FROM THE SAME SAINT CYRIL, from the apology of the seventh anathematism against the criticisms of Theodoret<sup><a href="#fn279" id="ref279">279</a></sup>: "The union shows us one and we refuse to divide him into two. For although having become flesh, according to the Scriptures<sup><a href="#fn280" id="ref280">280</a></sup>, even in this state the Word is however the Monogenes Son because of the true union, which surpasses understanding and discourse. He himself, therefore, the unique and only Christ Jesus performing through his own body, as through the intermediary of an organ, the divine signs, and we do not say that he was incited to action in the manner of the saints, for it is impious and completely mad to say so!"</p>

And no one would sink to that degree of folly to say that the ineffable nature, which surpasses nature and to whom it is impossible to endure any suffering, was seized by our infirmity. But since the salvation of the world depended on his suffering, and on the other hand it was impossible that the Word who issued from God suffered in his own nature, he arranged very wisely the work of the economy: he appropriated for himself a body capable of suffering, so that he might be said to have suffered in what is naturally apt to suffer, while remaining himself impassible in his own nature. Given that he suffered voluntarily in the flesh, he is and is called for that very reason the Savior of all; for, as Paul said: 'By the grace of God he tasted death for us all'<sup><a href="#fn282" id="ref282">282</a></sup>. This is also testified by the divine Peter, who said very wisely: 'Christ therefore suffered for us', not in the nature of the divinity, but rather 'in the flesh'<sup><a href="#fn283" id="ref283">283</a></sup>."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — Why is your own mind blinded? What fissure do you see in this between the Word and the flesh that was united to him? Is it because the wise man said what Peter had declared: 'Christ therefore suffered for us in the flesh', and not in the nature of his divinity, that it seems to you that Saint Cyril removes from the Word himself the body that was hypostatically united to him, endowed, that is, with an intelligent soul? Do you not hear him say that he made the passible body his own? It is with good reason, therefore, that the suffering is also said to be his. Indeed, either you strip him of the flesh, or you do not remove from him the affirmation that he suffered, while remaining impassible in his own nature. But listen also to what follows and which you have intentionally suppressed.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">FROM SAINT CYRIL, the text that follows the chapter<sup><a href="#fn284" id="ref284">284</a></sup>: "And otherwise, in what manner is the Lord of glory said to have been crucified?<sup><a href="#fn285" id="ref285">285</a></sup> And how has he by whom all things exist<sup><a href="#fn286" id="ref286">286</a></sup> and in whom all things subsist<sup><a href="#fn287" id="ref287">287</a></sup>, as the blessed Paul says, been given by God the Father as head of the body of the Church, has he also become the firstborn from the dead?<sup><a href="#fn288" id="ref288">288</a></sup> It is therefore clear that he also made his own the sufferings that occurred to his flesh; but the Lord of glory does not become an ordinary man." AND SHORTLY AFTER<sup><a href="#fn289" id="ref289">289</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "Is it therefore in the death of an ordinary man that we are baptized<sup><a href="#fn290" id="ref290">290</a></sup> and that, believing in him, we are also justified? Or rather, what is the truth, is it in announcing the death of a God who became man and suffered for us in the flesh, and in confessing his resurrection that we destroy the weight of sin?"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And let this be said concerning the present chapter; I refer the reader moreover to what we have said above in the eleventh chapter<sup><a href="#fn291" id="ref291">291</a></sup>.

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[66.] SIXTY-SIXTH CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the first letter to the monks, of which here is the beginning: "Some have arrived..."<sup><a href="#fn292" id="ref292">292</a></sup> — "But perhaps you will allege this: Tell me then, is the Holy Virgin the mother of the divinity? To which we respond that the Word of God, living, endowed with a hypostasis, was truly begotten from the very essence of God the Father, that he enjoys eternally an existence without beginning in time, that he subsists with him who begat him and that he exists and is known with him and in him; but in the last times of the world, because he became flesh, that is to say he was united to a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul, he is said also to have become according to the flesh through the intermediary of woman. The mystery concerning him presents an analogy with our childbearing. Indeed, the mothers of those who are on earth, obeying nature for generation, have a flesh in their womb; this gradually takes body, and, thanks to inexplicable operations of God, develops and is completed therein into a human appearance; and God breathes the spirit into the living being in a manner known to him alone. 'He forms, indeed, the spirit of man within him'<sup><a href="#fn293" id="ref293">293</a></sup>, according to the word of the prophet. For the reason of the flesh is other and, similarly, that of the soul is other."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — Henceforth put an end to such reckless impudence, O corrupt man! Why do you amputate the holy and inspired words of the Saint? For, although the reason of the flesh is other and similarly that of the soul is other, he nevertheless became one man from the two, thanks to the union. Although the divinity is by nature something other and the humanity is other, Emmanuel is nonetheless recognized as one from the two. It is not, indeed, because the elements from which he is the unique and only Christ are not confused, that henceforth, according to your folly, he undergoes separation into two. And this will be further recognized by what [was cut off from the chapter]. FROM SAINT CYRIL, the text that follows the chapter and which the adversary impiously suppressed<sup><a href="#fn294" id="ref294">294</a></sup>: "But although they became mothers only of the bodies alone that come from the earth, nevertheless, giving birth to the whole living being, to him, I say, who is of soul and body, they are not said to bear only a part. No one would say either, for example, that Elizabeth is the mother of a flesh and that she is not moreover the mother of a soul. For she gave birth to the Baptist, therefore, with a soul and a unique man made of two elements, I mean a soul and a body. We will admit that something analogous was accomplished at the birth of Emmanuel. Indeed, it is from [the essence] of God [the Father] that the Word, his [Monogenes Son], was begotten, as I have said; but since, taking a flesh and making it his own, [he was also called Son of Man] and he became [like us], it is in no way out of place to say, as I believe, but rather necessary to confess, that he was born according to the flesh by a woman, in the same manner that the soul of man is also born with its body and is reputed to be one with it, although by nature it is recognized and is other according to its proper reason, apart from it. Hence, if someone wanted to say that the mother of such a one is mother of the flesh and that she is not, moreover, the mother of the soul, he would express utterly empty things. For she gave birth, as I have said, to a living being, composed, according to a superior wisdom, of elements dissimilar among themselves and which is yet, from the two, one unique man. Each remaining what it was, they concurred together in a natural union, as if they had both mixed what is proper to each of them."</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[67.] SIXTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the first letter to the monks<sup><a href="#fn295" id="ref295">295</a></sup>: "Whom did the Father anoint with an oil of gladness<sup><a href="#fn296" id="ref296">296</a></sup>, namely the Holy Spirit? If therefore it is properly the God Word, who alone is issued from him, and they say that this is the expression of the truth, they do not notice how they prejudice the nature of the Monogenes and alter the mystery of the economy linked to the flesh. For if it is the Word who, being God, was anointed by the Holy Spirit, he was in any way lacking in [holiness], and, despite themselves, they profess that, in the times which [preceded] and when he had not yet received [the anointing], he did not have [part] in the gift that was conferred [upon him afterwards]. Now, what requires [sanctification] is mutable by [nature] and is not considered [in any way] exempt from sin, or from the faculty of sinning. Would the Word therefore also have undergone an accidental change towards a superior state? How then is he the same and has he remained unchanged? And if it is while being God and in the form and equality of the Father that the Word was anointed and sanctified, one might venture to say, led by this state of affairs to an inconsistent idea, that the Father also perhaps needed sanctification; even more, that henceforth the Son appears greater than him, if he was sanctified by [him], whereas he was already equal to him and in the form of the Father [before] the sanctification. The Father [would have remained, he, in the state in which he had been from all time] and in which he was, not having yet received increase towards [a better state], due to the fact that he was not [sanctified] in the manner [of the Son]. Consequently, greater [than both of them would appear] the Spirit who sanctifies them, since it is not doubtful that 'without contradiction it is the inferior who receives the blessing' from the superior<sup><a href="#fn297" id="ref297">297</a></sup>. But all that is only foolishness, verbiage, and inept subtleties. For the consubstantial Trinity is holy by nature, the Father is holy, the Son also is essentially holy in an equal manner, and similarly also the Holy Spirit. Hence, with regard to his own nature, the Word issued from God the Father was not sanctified apart from himself."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — Who would not be astonished at this shameful attempt? For it is by suppressing what Saint Cyril declares out of place and impious, because in line with those who divide Christ into two, that this arrogant one strives to make it appear that the wise doctor proposes contrary doctrines. Now the manner of proceeding of the Saint is the following: If you say that the God Word dwelt in a man, O impious ones, they are necessarily two, and not one incarnate. Intervene therefore in the discussion and say who is he whom God the Father anointed with an oil of gladness. If you say the God Word, how did the Saint by nature need sanctification? If on the other hand it is the man born of the Virgin, how did he who was anointed rise to such a height that he is rendered worthy to sit on the same throne as God the Father? But it is quite evident that he is one and the same, he who, according to his own nature, sits together with him who begat him, who, on the other hand, was anointed with us according to humanity, having become flesh, that is to say united to a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul. That it is so, this emerges from the text that precedes the chapter and which was suppressed by the adversary. FROM SAINT CYRIL, the text that precedes the chapter and which the adversary suppressed<sup><a href="#fn298" id="ref298">298</a></sup>: "The Word, who is in the form and equality of God the Father, therefore humbled himself<sup><a href="#fn299" id="ref299">299</a></sup> by becoming flesh<sup><a href="#fn300" id="ref300">300</a></sup>, as John said, and by being born through the intermediary of a woman. And he who has his birth from God the Father, endured for us to undergo ours. Otherwise, let them (us) themselves teach how the Word, who issued from God the Father, is recognized and declared by us the Christ. If it is because he was anointed that he is called Christ, whom the Father anointed with an oil of gladness, namely the Holy Spirit?"<sup><a href="#fn301" id="ref301">301</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">You see how, to refute those who split the one Christ into two, he composed these words after having first proposed his own sound opinion. The same thing also emerges from the text that follows the chapter and which the adversary has also cut off. FROM SAINT CYRIL, [the text that follows the chapter and that the adversary cut off]<sup><a href="#fn302" id="ref302">302</a></sup>: "But if someone believes that he who was born of the Holy Virgin was alone anointed and sanctified, and that it is for this very reason that he was called Christ, let him intervene and say if the anointing is sufficient to make him who was anointed appear equal in glory and sitting together with the God who is above all!" And after having, in the interval, said many things that censure the impiety of those who divide the one Christ into two, he then adds, defining again his sound opinion, this [CYRIL] "He, however, is not in those conditions that are ours, but he is by nature and in truth Son and Lord of the universe and (come) from heaven."<sup><a href="#fn303" id="ref303">303</a></sup></p>

But rather, bringing back to union the Word issued from the Father and the man, who is perfect, issued from the Virgin, we will also adore one unique Christ, Jesus and Lord: we do not place him outside the limits of divinity because of the flesh, and we do not lower him to the level of simple humanity because of the likeness he has with us. It is thus that you will understand that the Word issued from the Father underwent the voluntary stripping. It is in this sense that he who by nature was free humbled himself by taking the condition of a slave<sup><a href="#fn305" id="ref305">305</a></sup>. It is thus that he took from the seed of Abraham<sup><a href="#fn306" id="ref306">306</a></sup> and that he partook of blood and flesh<sup><a href="#fn307" id="ref307">307</a></sup>."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — Once again the adversary believes, on this basis, that a perfect man was formed separately and apart from him, all alone, and was joined according to relations of friendship to the God Word, and that it is because of the equality of the name of sonship that the Son and Lord Jesus Christ is said to be one. But, remembering what the Saint said previously, we demonstrate that such an opinion is foreign and totally removed from orthodox teachings. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the same letter to the monks, of which here is the beginning: ["Some have come...", which the adversary stole]<sup><a href="#fn308" id="ref308">308</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — What was noted concerning the previous chapter will suffice for the present truth or apology. Indeed, the Word was united hypostatically to the body born of the holy Virgin, endowed, that is understood, with an intelligent soul: it is on this basis that he assigns to himself the birth of the body that is his, in the same manner that the soul of man which is ours also attributes to itself the birth of the flesh that is its own.</p>

I think that this makes no doubt to anyone. And yet what happens is called 'the death of man'. Think also likewise concerning Emmanuel. Indeed, the Word was in his body born of woman; he delivered it to death in due time, while he himself experienced no suffering in his own nature. For he is life and life-giving."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — I do not know if, in producing this chapter, you are struggling with us or with yourself! Indeed, if the God Word was united to his flesh, just as the soul of man is united to his body, to which suffering also is proper, you say, despite yourself, that you confess that the passible flesh is his, although he remained impassible in his own nature. Why then do you wish to cut off the words of Saint Cyril censuring your impiety, which I cite immediately? FROM SAINT CYRIL, the words that precede the chapter and that the adversary cut off<sup><a href="#fn312" id="ref312">312</a></sup>: "Indeed, because his death was for the world the redemption, despising the ignominy, he endured the cross<sup><a href="#fn313" id="ref313">313</a></sup>, while being life by nature as God.

He permitted that, by the economy, his flesh be humiliated even unto death for a little while; but in turn he himself destroyed death — because he was the Life who in no way admits to undergo what is on the margin of his own nature — so that corruption might be weakened also in the body of all and that the power of death might be destroyed."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — The fact that the Saint said: "His flesh was humiliated unto death for a little while" still flatters the unhealthy thought of the adversary. As if it were a foreign flesh, and not that of the Word himself, which had undergone death, so that he who suffered might be recognized as being another, apart from him, and not one and the same, who suffered in the flesh, but remained impassible in the divinity because of the immortality and the indestructible character of his nature. It will indeed appear clearly also from what is about to be cited that, even in hearing "the flesh", we understand the God Word incarnate, without setting aside his flesh. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the same letter to the monks, shortly after the chapter<sup><a href="#fn315" id="ref315">315</a></sup>: "For he who ignores death descended with us into death through the intermediary of his flesh, to make us also ascend with him to life. He is, indeed, resurrected and forced hell, not as a man like us, but as God in the flesh with us and above us. The (human) nature was enriched in him, the first, with incorruptibility, and death, which had penetrated as a tyrannical enemy into the body of the Life, was crushed." AND SHORTLY AFTER<sup><a href="#fn316" id="ref316">316</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "Therefore when he who was crucified is also truly God and king by nature, when he is also said to be Lord of glory<sup><a href="#fn317" id="ref317">317</a></sup>, how would one hesitate to call the Holy Virgin Mother of God? Adore one only, without dividing him into two after the union. Then the foolish Jew will laugh in vain, then he will become truly the murderer of his Lord. He will be caught in the act of iniquity, not against one of our like, but against God himself, the Savior of the universe; then also he will hear: 'Ah! sinful nation, people filled with sins, perverse offspring, criminal sons! You have forsaken the Lord and you have irritated the Holy One of Israel'<sup><a href="#fn318" id="ref318">318</a></sup>. And the pagans will in no way blame the faith of Christians. For we have rendered worship, not to an ordinary man, not at all! but rather to him who is God by nature, without forgetting his glory: although having become like us, he also remained what he was, that is to say God, by whom and with whom glory be to the Father in the centuries. Amen!"</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[72.] SEVENTY-SECOND CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the second letter to the monks, where the symbol of the 318 is commented, of which here is the beginning: "The zeal for study and the labors inspired by your charity..."<sup><a href="#fn319" id="ref319">319</a></sup> — "The wise John said that the Word became flesh<sup><a href="#fn320" id="ref320">320</a></sup>. He became flesh, not by transition or change or alteration, by transforming into the nature of flesh, nor by undergoing amalgamation, mixture or what some spread under the name of consubstantiation — it is impossible, indeed, because he is in a nature that is immutable and unalterable — but it is rather, as I have said, because he took a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul from a holy and pure body and appropriated it to himself. It is the custom of inspired Scripture to designate sometimes also by the flesh alone the whole man: 'I will pour out, it says indeed, my spirit upon all flesh'<sup><a href="#fn321" id="ref321">321</a></sup>. It is not assuredly in flesh devoid of intelligent soul that God promises to infuse the grace of the Spirit, but rather in men constituted of soul and body."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — I would not need to say a word about this, I who, on multiple occasions in what precedes, have clearly demonstrated that those who say that the nature of the incarnate God Word is unique, never fall under the accusation of mixture and consubstantiation. Also I should have let this chapter fall. But since the adversary has not forgotten in this chapter either this most reckless pillage — once again he cut off the words of the Saint, where he criticizes those who divide the one Christ into two — I have deemed necessary to unveil his audacity. FROM SAINT CYRIL, the text that follows the chapter and which the adversary cut off<sup><a href="#fn322" id="ref322">322</a></sup>: "Therefore, it is without ceasing to be what he was that the Word became man, and, while appearing under the aspect that is ours, he remained the Word. And Christ is not recognized first a man who, subsequently, came to be God; but it is while being God that he became man, so that he is recognized God and man at the same time in the same. Those therefore who divide him into two sons and dare to say that the Word joined to himself the man who comes from the seed of David, that he subsequently gave him a part of sovereignty, of dignity, as well as the honor of sonship, and that he disposed him to bear the cross, to die, to return to life, to ascend into heaven and to sit at the right hand of the Father, so that he who received these homages by a divine elevation might be adored by every creature, those begin by confessing two sons, and then, in their ignorance, overturn the sense of the mystery. For it is not from a man that Christ became God, as I have said, but it is as God that the Word became flesh, that is to say man. He is said to have been stripped because before the stripping, he possessed the fullness in his own nature, since he is recognized God. — No one, indeed, empty as he was, rose to the summit. — He lowered himself from the divine heights, from the ineffable glory; it is not by being a humiliated man that he was exalted by a glorification of which he would have been the object. It is as free that he took the condition of a slave, and it is not by being a slave that he raised himself, by an ascension, to the glory of a state of freedom. It is he who was in the condition and equality of the Father who became in the condition of men, and not by being man that he was enriched, by assuming to be of the condition of God. Why then do they overturn the notions of the economy and transform the truth, rising up against all the inspired writings, which recognize him to be God and incarnate Son and which everywhere call him one?"</p>

I hold that as the symptom of the ultimate folly! But each of them remaining in what defines and determines it, their mutual concurrence into a perfect and inexplicable unity is indicated here by the use of the word conjunction. For the same is at the same time God and man: in saying God, you will not thereby set aside the humanity after the union and, inversely, in saying man, you will not strip him either of the dignity of divinity, if at least you wish to have an orthodox thought."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — This treatise, which is limited to a short exposition, I profess to have also read and to have found there the beginning that the adversary cited. But it seems to me rather cut off from some other work, as the drafting of the exposition also shows. For Saint Cyril, that wise artisan of admirable expositions, would not have composed a beginning of a book of this kind: "He himself, indeed, is the immaculate splendor of God the Father..." That this implies relation to another preceding book, is obvious to anyone, including he who has received only a summary formation in rhetoric. We have therefore made researches about it during our leisure. Now, that the treatise is not foreign to him, but the authentic fruit of the holy thought of Cyril, I also recognize with him. But the adversary thinks, because he said: "Each of them remaining in what defines and determines it", that there is place for division into two. He errs however in a total aberration! For the Saint expressed himself in that manner, not so that we think that the natures, from which Emmanuel is constituted, subsisted in their proper constitution, but so that we reject the thought of a change. That it is so, I cite (for proof) the words that precede the chapter and which make clearly recognized that Emmanuel is one from the two, humanity and divinity. Now, the expression "from the two" signifies that the natures from which the one Christ is constituted have not subsisted (in him) isolated and apart. FROM SAINT CYRIL, the words [that precede the chapter and that the adversary cut off]<sup><a href="#fn324" id="ref324">324</a></sup>: "Indeed, while he himself was the immaculate splendor, the form and the image of God the Father, the God Word, who is from him and in him, lowered himself to the stripping; not that he was brought to it by force by anyone, but, by the benevolence of the Father, he became man of his own will, in a perfect manner, without suffering any damage or change. He preserved in himself the dignity of his own nature, but, according to the economy, he took humanity and he is recognized to be one Son from the two. The nature of God and (the nature) human concurred together and assembled into one, entering into composition for the union in an inexplicable, ineffable manner and which it is impossible to understand."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">FROM THE SAME SAINT CYRIL, from the second letter to Succensus<sup><a href="#fn325" id="ref325">325</a></sup>: "Therefore neither the nature of the Word passed into the nature of the flesh, nor that of the flesh (passed) into that of the Word itself. But each remaining and being recognized in what is proper to it by nature, according to the exposition we have just given, the ineffable and inexplicable union showed us one unique nature of the Son, but, as I have said, incarnate."</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[74.] SEVENTY-FOURTH CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the letter to Valerian, bishop of Iconium, of which here is the beginning: "It suffices, as I believe, or rather following what truth is naturally."<sup><a href="#fn326" id="ref326">326</a></sup> — "Assuredly, what is from the flesh is flesh, and what is from God is God. But Christ is at the same time both and he is one unique Son and one unique Lord with his flesh, not devoid of soul, but rather, as I have said, endowed with an intelligent soul."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — The intention of the adversary, from what we have already said on multiple occasions, is evident to everyone, even if we remain silent. He thinks, indeed, from the fact that the elements from which Christ is (formed) did not transform but remained in their natural property, that he who was inseparably and indissolubly united to a flesh, endowed with a rational soul, is divided into two. Citing once again the text that follows the chapter, we censure the theft of sacred words that he operates in vain. FROM SAINT CYRIL, the text that follows the chapter and which the adversary cut off<sup><a href="#fn327" id="ref327">327</a></sup>: "Let them not therefore split into two the unique Son, by placing apart, clearly distinct, the Word and the Son, and apart also the man issued from the woman, as they say. Let them consider on the contrary that the Word was not joined to a man, but that he is said to have become man himself, by taking from the seed of Abraham<sup><a href="#fn328" id="ref328">328</a></sup>, following the Scriptures, and by being made in all things like his brothers, with the sole exception of sin<sup><a href="#fn329" id="ref329">329</a></sup>. Now this resemblance in all will be for him, naturally and before the rest, to be born of a woman — a thing that is conceived among us in a human manner and conformable to ours, but according to a superior mode when it concerns the Monogenes, for it was a God who incarnated himself. — And it is for this motive also that the Holy Virgin is called Mother of God. But if they declare that God and man, by joining together to (form) the same, formed one unique Christ, it being understood that the hypostasis of each of them maintained itself without confusion, separated (from the other) according to its (proper) reason, one can see that they think and say nothing exact about this. For it is not, as they say, by joining one to the other, that God and man formed one Christ. But, as I have already said, the Word, while being God, partook similarly to us in blood and flesh, so that it might be recognized that he was God made man and that he had taken our flesh and appropriated it to himself; for, just as the man who is ours, constituted of a soul and a body, is recognized to be one, thus, he too, is professed to be one unique Son and Lord. One professes indeed one unique nature and hypostasis of man, while recognizing him (constituted) from different realities and diverse species: the body, certainly, is truly heterogeneous in relation to the soul, but it is proper to it and forms with it the hypostasis of one unique man. And if in spirit and by an intellectual consideration one does not ignore the difference of the elements that were named, their reunion, or the concurrence of one with the other, implies regarding absence of separation makes of man a unique living being.”</p>

Christ is therefore said to have suffered in the flesh<sup><a href="#fn331" id="ref331">331</a></sup>, according to the Scriptures. For the Impassible was in a body that suffered.”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — Here he has manifestly altered Holy Scripture. Indeed, whereas Saint Cyril expressed himself as follows: "He is therefore said to have suffered in his own flesh, according to the Scriptures," so that it might be recognized that one and the same suffered in the flesh but did not suffer in the divinity, this corrupt man, distorting the truth, wrote: "Christ is therefore said to have suffered in the flesh," so that the Christ who suffered might be thought to be other than the God Word. Moreover, whereas the Saint had written: "He was, indeed, himself in the body that suffered," he modified it in this manner: "For the Impassible was in a body that suffered," aiming thereby only to fight in favor of his unhealthy opinion, according to which the Christ who suffered is other and also the impassible Word is other. And indeed, if he did not begin by dividing, one would not suspect or suspect him. For the formula: "The Impassible was in a body that suffered" is stated elsewhere by Saint Cyril in these very terms. But I cite as appropriate the authentic version of the chapter. Authentic version of the chapter<sup><a href="#fn332" id="ref332">332</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "He is therefore truly impassible in his own nature, as I have said, the Word of God. But he is said to have suffered in his own flesh according to the Scriptures, for he was himself in the body that suffered."</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[76-90.]</span> And so things stand. In the chapters that follow this one up to the ninetieth, the adversary has lost sight that he was striking in the air<sup><a href="#fn333" id="ref333">333</a></sup> and struggling in vain. He asserted indeed, as we have said frequently, that from the fact that the natures from which Emmanuel is constituted have not been changed, it follows, by strict and logical norms, a division into two. But we have spoken sufficiently, and with strong arguments, about this hollow theory in what has already been examined. For all these chapters situated in the interval, I offer a single apology, borrowed from the inspired word of Cyril. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the fifth tome against the blasphemies of Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn334" id="ref334">334</a></sup>: “If therefore each of those who are instructed in the holy words considers it an absurdity even to hear that a change was accomplished in the Monogenes, why, welcoming as true and declared things so absurd, rejected by a unanimous and absolute sentiment, do you try to divide the Indivisible, and that after the union? If you indeed wish truly to learn who it is who was delivered to the Jews by the traitor, you will hear clearly that it is the unique and only Christ, Son and Lord. Let us hear the Word issued from God, made man and incarnate, when he had assumed the condition of a slave. For he was sold by the traitor to the leaders of the Jews and he was arrested according to the humanity, since, while remaining God, he was also man, but he rebuked according to the divinity the weakness of those who had seized him.”</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[91.] NINETY-FIRST CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the interpretation “On Abraham and Melchisedech,” of which here is the beginning: “The God of the universe gave us the Law as help...”<sup><a href="#fn335" id="ref335">335</a></sup> — “Well then, let us express what happened in the time of Cyrus, applying clearly and evidently to the mystery of Christ the remarkable things accomplished by him. Cyrus therefore had for mother Mandane, daughter of Astyages, the leader of the Medes, and for father Cambyses, who was of Persian race and of very humble condition. It is from that that certain ancients called Cyrus a mule and allogene, because, I believe, of the difference of race of his father and mother: the Perses, indeed, constitute a people different from that of the Medes. Indeed, you see something similar concerning Christ: for by his mother, he is issued according to the flesh from the Holy Virgin, who is like us and of human nature, while his Father, who is in no way of ours, is, so to speak, completely allogene and of a superior nature.”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — I am astonished by the confused thought of the adversary. It is not, indeed, because Emmanuel was begotten of God the Father according to divinity, and of the Virgin Mother when he became flesh, that is to say by uniting without change to a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul, that we henceforth divide him into two natures. For the union has not extinguished the difference of the natures, from which the unique and only Christ is constituted, but it has destroyed and banished division into two. And it is not because the generation of the divinity of the Word made flesh is different from that of the humanity, that, dissolving for that very reason the union, we necessarily also say two natures and two sons. Just as it is not because the substance of the soul is different from that of the body, that henceforth, for that reason, man, made of two realities which have been united one to the other in an indivisible union, is not a unique nature. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the first tome against the blasphemies of Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn336" id="ref336">336</a></sup>: “Therefore, to advance by the royal road, we say that there were two generations, but that he who was begotten by the two is a unique Son: the Word issued from God, when he was not yet become flesh, and the same, who is also incarnate and suffered for us, when he became flesh, the birth from a woman.” FROM THE SAME, from the second tome against the blasphemies of Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn337" id="ref337">337</a></sup>: [CYRIL] “For he is not double, but unique and only, the Lord and Son, the Word issued from God the Father, who is not without the flesh.”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, that there is a difference or a considerable distance between divinity and humanity, I personally also grant. For the things named, from the perspective of how they are, are visibly other and are in no way similar one to the other. But when the mystery accomplished in Christ presents itself to us, the reason of the union, without ignoring the difference, excludes separation: not that it confounds or mixes the natures one with the other, but because, while partaking of flesh and blood, the Word of God, even in that state, is recognized and called a unique Son.” FROM THE SAME, from the second letter to Succensus<sup><a href="#fn338" id="ref338">338</a></sup>: [CYRIL] “The ineffable and inexplicable union manifested to us a unique nature of the Son, but, as I have said, incarnate. For it is not concerning only those who are simple by nature that one speaks rightly of unity, but also concerning those who have been assembled by composition, such as this thing that is man, made of soul and body. For such elements are of different species and are dissimilar among themselves in essence; but once united, they form a unique nature of man, although, according to the reasons of the composite, there is a difference in the nature of the elements which met for the union.”</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[92.] NINETY-SECOND CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM THE SAME SAINT CYRIL, from the Scholia<sup><a href="#fn339" id="ref339">339</a></sup>: “The name of Christ does not have the value of a definition and does not designate either what is the essence of a being, as is the case for ‘man’, ‘horse’ or ‘ox’, but rather signifies a thing that is realized in a being.”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — If it was with the intention of making known the treatise or writing of the Scholia that he cited this beginning, it would be superfluous to make an apology for it. But since he counted it among the chapters, it is necessary to undertake its defense. Even if the name of Christ signifies the thing realized in someone, and if the Monogenes, the Word of God, was anointed with us according to the humanity with an oil of gladness<sup><a href="#fn340" id="ref340">340</a></sup>, namely the Holy Spirit — although he possesses it by nature and essentially, naturally, as the Father possesses it — it is not for that, we say, that he was himself under the action of the Holy Spirit, as the adversary thought. For he himself did not need anointing; it is for us, on the contrary, that he was anointed, as firstfruits of our race, so that we ourselves might receive in him, first (relative to us), the gift of the Holy Spirit. FROM THE SAME SAINT CYRIL, from the same Scholia<sup><a href="#fn341" id="ref341">341</a></sup>: “Concerning Christ, our Savior of all, we say that there was an anointing, not symbolic, like that which is performed with oil, nor yet that (conferred) by the prophetic gift, nor even that which is recognized to be granted for the execution of something of that kind.” FROM THE SAME CYRIL, from the second tome against the blasphemies of Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn342" id="ref342">342</a></sup>: “And how would it not have been necessary that the Christ who, following your views, was under the action of another and held from outside the glory proper to the Monogenes, say to those who addressed him as God and needed the help emanating from him: In the name of the Monogenes, or again by his power, may such a good belong to you! For that is what the disciples, wisest of all, did who everywhere pronounced the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. But there is absolutely no one to whom he held such language. He rather attributed to his own power what was accomplished, saying sometimes to the blind: ‘Do you believe that I can do this?’<sup><a href="#fn343" id="ref343">343</a></sup> and demanding their assent, saying sometimes with authority to the leper: ‘I will; be clean!’<sup><a href="#fn344" id="ref344">344</a></sup>” FROM THE SAME, from the fourth tome against the blasphemies of Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn345" id="ref345">345</a></sup>: [CYRIL] “For he was truly glorified, when the Holy Spirit operated the divine signs; not that he obtained the thing, as a theophoric man, from the nature foreign (to him) and transcendent — as is our case — but rather as putting into operation his own Spirit: for he was God by nature and his Spirit was not foreign to him.”</p>

It was necessary that, returning by the mercy of God to what it was in the beginning, it be rendered worthy of the Spirit. The Monogenes, the Word of God, made himself man and appeared with an earthly body to those who were on earth, and he was exempt from sin, so that human nature, crowned in him, and in him alone, with the prerogatives of impeccability, he prepared it for the Holy Spirit and that it be in this manner rendered again like God by sanctification. For it is thus that the gift is transmitted to us, taking its source in Christ, the firstborn among us.”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — I am stunned, O man, by the emptiness of your mind. How do you not feel that you are struggling with yourself? Behold, Cyril has manifestly placed the reason that the God Word, in incarnating and making himself man, submitted to the anointing that is ours, with the intention of preparing our entire race for the coming of the Holy Spirit. What division do you therefore see in that, or why do you therefore set aside the anointing of the God Word, who became incarnate for us, and establish a man, recognized (as such) separately and apart? That indeed is what holds you to this and in all that! But I will cite other words of Saint Cyril, which illustrate his opinion and destroy the division. FROM THE SAME [………]<sup><a href="#fn348" id="ref348">348</a></sup>: [CYRIL] “But since he regards the anointing as something humble, human, immeasurably surpassed by the dignity of the Monogenes, well then, eliminating the cause of scandal, let us say in this also what is fitting. If therefore he did not become man, let us set aside from him human conditions, let us reject the economy, since it ranks him among humble beings and lowers him from the transcendent glory and greatness proper to God. For these conditions that are ours are vile for the Word. But because the mystery is truly wise, it does not proscribe the reality of the stripping. Why, precipitating yourself into danger, do you blame what was said exactly, and alter, as inappropriate, this perfect extract of his? You have seen that he is anointed according to humanity, see that he also anoints, the same, according to divinity.”</p>

It is therefore for this that it is also written: ‘The Holy Spirit descended on Christ and remained there’<sup><a href="#fn350" id="ref350">350</a></sup>. One therefore calls Christ the Word of God who, for us, is man like us and in the condition of a slave; he was anointed among us as man, according to the flesh, but, as God, he anoints in the Holy Spirit those who believe in him.”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — The very wise and holy Cyril also recognizes in this chapter that it is the same who is anointed according to humanity, and who, according to divinity, anoints in the Holy Spirit those who believe in him. I have no need to discourse at length on this. The adversary infers from what is said that the nature of man resplended in him, that it is not for our race and for all humanity that it is recognized to have been anointed, as firstfruits, so that it might be worthy to receive the Holy Spirit, but that (this) sets aside the Word from the human nature to which he was united hypostatically, so that the latter might be understood as having received separately the Holy Spirit it needed; also I deem again necessary to make the truth appear by the words of Cyril himself and to take issue with the perversity of the adversary. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the first tome against the blasphemies of Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn351" id="ref351">351</a></sup>: “Thus, indeed, being rich, he made himself poor, he introduces us to his own riches and, through the intermediary of the flesh united to him, he possesses all of us in him. It is thus, indeed, it is thus that we have been buried with Christ by baptism, that we are risen with him<sup><a href="#fn352" id="ref352">352</a></sup> and that we sit with him in heaven<sup><a href="#fn353" id="ref353">353</a></sup>. Thus wrote the wise Paul, the treasure of his mysteries, the Herald, the apostle and the minister of his evangelical precepts.” FROM THE SAME, from the third tome against the blasphemies of Nestorius<sup><a href="#fn354" id="ref354">354</a></sup>: [CYRIL] “He therefore also rose from the dead, breathed on the disciples and said: ‘Receive the Holy Spirit’<sup><a href="#fn355" id="ref355">355</a></sup>. And those who had received it said: ‘We, it is not the spirit of the world that we have received, but the Spirit which comes from God, so that we might see the graces which have been given to us by God’<sup><a href="#fn356" id="ref356">356</a></sup>.’ And the very wise Paul writes again: ‘And those who are in the flesh cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. If someone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him<sup><a href="#fn357" id="ref357">357</a></sup>.’ And elsewhere again: ‘For all those who are led by the Spirit of God are the Sons of God<sup><a href="#fn358" id="ref358">358</a></sup>.’ Also, when you see him anointed with his own Spirit, remember the economy linked to the flesh and consider the human aspect; and when you see him distributing the Spirit, admire moreover the God, who is in humanity.”</p>

I cite again the text which precedes the chapter, reproaching you for your impious theft. FROM SAINT CYRIL, the text which precedes the chapter and which the adversary cut off<sup><a href="#fn360" id="ref360">360</a></sup>: “Thus we say that the God Word, issued from God, became of ours, ‘appearing’, as it is said somewhere, ‘on earth and dwelling among men’<sup><a href="#fn361" id="ref361">361</a></sup>, after having found all the way of Wisdom and given it to Jacob his servant and to Israel his favored one<sup><a href="#fn362" id="ref362">362</a></sup>.

For, that it is for all human nature that Christ received the Spirit and not for his own, (himself), being divided into two, following what you thought in ignorance, is what clearly appears from the continuation: “He is indeed constituted as the second firstfruits of our race.” And that also emerges from what you voluntarily cut off.

        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — If the Word partook as we in blood and flesh, it is clear that he was united hypostatically to a flesh endowed with a rational and intelligent soul; for that is what the humanity is that became proper to the Word by the union. Hence, even being incarnate, he is recognized and said to be one; and it is not because we say that his humanity is complete that we set it aside (from him), dissolving the unity of the Word, as this adversary thought. For the union without confusion, which departs from division into two, does not diminish either the elements which were united. FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the second letter to Succensus<sup><a href="#fn368" id="ref368">368</a></sup>: “For if, after having said a unique nature of the God Word, we had remained silent and not added the word ‘incarnate’, but had in some way set aside the economy, then perhaps they would have had a plausible reason to ask hypocritically: Where is the integrity required by humanity, or: How did our essence subsist (in him)?

Indeed, when men are separated by sentiments and ideas and are divided among themselves, they are said to unite in a friendly reconciliation, when they make their resentment disappear. We also say that elements unite which are strongly concerned with each other or which assemble according to other processes, either by juxtaposition, or by combination, or by mixture. When therefore we say that the Word of God was united to our nature, the mode of the union surpasses, one sees, the understanding of man. For it conforms to none of the processes that have been spoken of, but it is absolutely inexpressible and escapes, assuredly, the knowledge of every being, except him who knows all. And there is nothing astonishing that we are surpassed by such thoughts, since, examining how the realities that concern ourselves are, we confess that their comprehension surpasses our spirit. In what manner, indeed, do we conceive that the soul of man is united to his body? Who could say it? But if it is necessary that we compare insignificant realities and that, ordinarily, we can scarcely understand and express, with realities as subtle and surpassing understanding and discourse, we say that it is fitting to think, — the expression is in any case inadequate, — that the union of Emmanuel is of the kind that one would represent as that of the human soul with its body. For the soul appropriates all that belongs to the body, although in its own nature it is exempt from both the natural passions (of the body) and those which befall it from outside. The body, indeed, is driven to natural desires, and the soul, because of the union that binds it to it, remains with it, but without participating in any way with it. It certainly considers the satisfaction of desire as its own enjoyment, and if it happens that the body is struck by someone and tortured by iron, it feels the pain with it, since it is its body that suffers, but itself, in its own nature, endures nothing of what affects it. But we say still more concerning the union of Emmanuel. It was indeed necessary that the soul, which was united to him, feel pain with the body, so that, while escaping the blows, it might bow its neck docilely before God. As for the God Word, it was not fitting for him to feel the blows with the body, for God is impassible and is not in our conditions. But he was united to a flesh endowed with a rational soul: while the flesh suffered, he himself, without suffering, was conscious of what was happening in it. And if he destroyed, as God, the infirmities of the body, it is because he made them his own, because they were those of his body. It is in this sense also that he is said to have been hungry<sup><a href="#fn378" id="ref378">378</a></sup>, to have been weary<sup><a href="#fn379" id="ref379">379</a></sup> and to have suffered for us<sup><a href="#fn380" id="ref380">380</a></sup>.”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — Refrain from fighting us, O my dear! For if you had believed that the union of Emmanuel is of the kind that the soul of man has with its body, you would have confessed despite yourself the hypostatic union and you would have rejected that which is realized by relations of friendship, by a thought of complacency, by identity of will and by equality of dignity and power, following the opinion of Nestorius, the initiator of such nonsense! Go then, and nourishing finally at least a good thought, say with us that the nature of the incarnate God Word is unique, — that is indeed what those who speak of the hypostatic union profess, — and refuse to say two natures after the union, — for that is the characteristic of those who, it is their word, declare that the flesh was united to the Word by a conjunction of complacency. — And this will emerge from the texts immediately cited. For it is completely ridiculous that, in conflict with yourself and as if clouded by the spirit, you sometimes appear to attach yourself to the exact thoughts of Saint Cyril and sometimes, on the contrary, to align yourself with the shameful opinion of Nestorius.</p>

    <div class="section">
        FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the second letter to Succensus<sup><a href="#fn381" id="ref381">381</a></sup>:</span> “Indeed, although we also say that the Only-Begotten, Son of God, who became incarnate and made man, is one, it is not for that reason that he is the fruit of a confusion, as it seems to them. For, once again, neither did the nature of the Word pass into that of the flesh, nor that of the flesh into that of the Word. But each of them remaining and being recognized in its natural property, according to the exposition we have just given, the ineffable and inexplicable union manifested to us a unique nature of the Son, but, as I have said, incarnate. For it is not only concerning those who are simple by nature that one speaks rightly of unity, but also concerning those who have been assembled one with the other by composition, such as this thing that is man, made of soul and body. For such elements, indeed, are of different species and are unequal one to the other by essence; but once united, they form a unique nature of man, although according to the principles of the composite there is a difference in the nature of the elements which arrived in concert at the union.”</p>
       FROM THE IMPIOUS NESTORIUS<sup><a href="#fn382" id="ref382">382</a></sup>:</span> “A power that is common to the two, a dignity that is the same for the two. As the natures remain, confess, confess a union of dignity!” AND ELSEWHERE AGAIN<sup><a href="#fn383" id="ref383">383</a></sup>:</span> [NESTORIUS] “Two natures, a unique sonship! Why do you slander the Word?”</p>

        <p class="paragraph"><span class="question">[100.] ONE HUNDREDTH CHAPTER OF THE ADVERSARY.</span> FROM SAINT CYRIL, from the same Scholia<sup><a href="#fn384" id="ref384">384</a></sup>:</span> “Also, it is not out of place that one would compare the union of the Word to humanity with our own condition. For, just as the body is heterogeneous relative to the soul, but a unique man is said to result from the two, so also, from the perfect hypostasis of the God Word and also from a humanity that is perfect according to its own reason, there is a unique Christ, the same, who is, in the same, both God and man. And if the Word makes his own, as I have said, what pertains to the flesh, because the flesh is his and not of another, he renders on the other hand common to himself and to his own flesh the action of the power that befits God, which is his, so as to be able both to resurrect the dead and heal those in the grip of infirmities.”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">APOLOGY. — Just as the natural and hypostatic union is one thing and the union consisting in relations of friendship, in equality of dignity and equal possession of the name of son is another, so also a natural communication is one thing and a presence consisting in complacency, in compassion with another, and in a thought of love, as Nestorius, the doctor of these miserable inventions, said. If therefore you unite hypostatically the Word to a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul, you correctly say that he relates to the suffering, seeing that it is that of his flesh; in this manner the suffering is also said to be his, although, as God, he is not subject to suffering. If, on the contrary, you separate the flesh from the Word, saying two natures after the union, the presence and participation in the sufferings are henceforth affective: thus one sees a friend sympathizing with the pain of his friend, or a king, whose image has been outraged, deeming that the outrage reaches him himself, or the God of the universe similarly appreciating the outrage that was done by the sons of Israel to Moses, to Aaron or again to the divine Samuel.</p>

    <div class="section">
     FROM NESTORIUS [...], from the letter to Alexander of Mabbug<sup><a href="#fn385" id="ref385">385</a></sup>:</span> “But if we transfer onto the God Word, as in the case of the royal image, the opprobrium of the cross which affects the flesh, it is necessarily by appealing to the complacency of the spirit that we attribute to the divinity the opprobrium of the flesh: which is the truth and overturns all the heretical chatter, which confuses things that cannot be confused. They want, indeed, 'themselves', to transfer the sufferings of the temple onto God, by virtue of natural proximity, as I have said, and not by virtue of a thought of complacency that he would feel toward his temple.”</p>

    <div class="section">
        CYRIL [......]<sup><a href="#fn386" id="ref386">386</a></sup>:</span> “It is for that reason therefore that he alone contradicts, — but with what vigor! — to set himself in conflict with universal sentiment, to brandish arms against the ineffable glory and that he dares to introduce into the Church of God a temerity (of language) that pleases only himself.” He affirms, indeed, that the inhumanation is a dwelling, and not that the Word of God willed rather to have part in blood and flesh like us<sup><a href="#fn387" id="ref387">387</a></sup>. Although the Word dwelt in all the saints and still dwells there, because at a given moment he became in our conditions, he associated hypostatically with a specific flesh, in which, — such is our faith, — he also died and rose again for us. For he suffered voluntarily in the flesh<sup><a href="#fn388" id="ref388">388</a></sup>.”</p>
