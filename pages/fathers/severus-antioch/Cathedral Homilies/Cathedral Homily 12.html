    <h1>Homily 12: St Anthony</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">1 ... They call them poor (?) , they put on gloomy airs and say: Your inheritance will be meager, my son, especially if for all the children that you are it is divided into three or four parts; and they feel something strange and hostile, those who at the beginning prayed to be worthy of having good sons; they lament over the number of children, and as soon as they see a boy so disposed they rejoice, overflow with pleasures and say: "May that one become a man!" Whereas it would be preferable and much more fitting to the circumstances to say to them: "You are mistaken, for you are not making this individual a man, but something wretched, evil, savage." Yes, all of you, on the one hand, if it happens that one of your children has an eye torn out, a hand or even his little finger paralyzed, you lament and consider that what happens to you is a cruel dishonor and covers you with shame; and on the other hand, if his soul is prey to many and incurable wounds, weighed down by gluttony, lust, pride, worldly pleasures, shameful passions, you no longer even realize that your attitude clearly shows that you have given life only to flesh, and not to souls endowed with sweet reason.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">2 On this subject, you pay attention only to ward off what would be a profitable thought, which precisely has the power to lead you astray; for, in this way, you wage war with yourselves and furthermore harm the salvation of your children. For most of the questions concerning them, you reduce to all the money you possess, which in advance constitutes the means of satisfying their passions: by doing this, together, both of you commit faults that can hardly be healed and for which there is no pardon. What, in your souls, you have laid bare, through the movements of justice, whereas today perhaps you are about to set out on the road from which there is nothing to gain to drink there, and you go, carried away (?) ...</p>
        <p class="paragraph">3 There is also the fact that, in the end, you tolerate that your children live in a state of sin... For he who provides abundance and seed to those who sin must share, in all justice with them, even their fruits. On this subject Qohelet said, calling it an infirmity: such a lack of intelligence "There is an infirmity that I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by someone for himself to his own misfortune"<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">4 ... And when we hear the holy book say: "He who is kind to the poor lends to the Lord"<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, and we see Christ in the street lacking necessary clothing, it is Him again that we despoil; and moreover what we are clothed with, we hide it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">5 So, if we reflect together with you, tell me, if you see a king pursued by enemies and adversaries, who, in the end, escaped the hands of his adversaries and was saved unexpectedly, (found) without any clothing and without anyone to render him great honors; in your company, you provide him with valuable and precious clothing, consolation and delights in abundance, while you expect that, if he resumes the affairs of the kingdom and the royal battles and holds the crown in honor, immediately you and your children, he will have you come to the royal court, remember the favors received and bring you to the first honors.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">6 Now Christ, the king of endless heaven, the God who does not deceive by his words nor by his promises which are not false, if you feed him or clothe him, with a little food or necessary clothing — for it is in this especially that the greatness of his love for mankind is found — would he not remember you and your children, and would he not reward you with honors and gifts worthy of God, now and also in the kingdom of heaven? Would that not be? Would it not be? One of those wise in divine things exclaims: "Consider the generations that have preceded us and see if anyone who hopes in the Lord was abandoned"<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>! Are we not indeed the fathers of our children so that before God and before our salvation...</p>
        <p class="paragraph">7 That is why you ought rather to go out (?) . For it is what is hard to bear that is rewarded with the most magnificence by Him. It is because of this that the door and the path of life are obstructed and encumbered, — for I pass over in silence that we are indebted with a new debt to (our) martyr: for just as the divine Babylas brought down fire from heaven upon the head of Apollo, if you remember what I said, so also he extinguishes the conflagration of our city, when he prays to Christ remembering us. May he prevent the violence of the flame, he who by his prayers will also save us from that fire which is unquenchable and eternal. To him be glory, now and at all times, and for ages of ages! Amen!</p>
