    <h1>Homily 22: On "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" and on what was said by Our Lord to the thief</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">On this (word): "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> and on what was said by Our Lord to the thief: "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise"<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Perhaps some of those who divide after the ineffable union this unique Our Lord and God Jesus Christ into a duality of natures, being drawn into human thoughts, ask, believing they are putting pious people in difficulty: Who is the one who cried out on the cross: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>? For us, we say with wisdom, being guided by the sacred books, that it is God the Word, he who became incarnate without change, it is he who did this, he who for us willingly became poor, and who, inasmuch as he became man, called the Father his God.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For he was nailed to the wood, inasmuch as the body that was hypostatically one with him was nailed. For he remains impassible as God, but he is not foreign to suffering: the body that suffered is indeed his and no one else's: therefore it is rightly believed that the suffering is also his. For, either, in your impiety, because you say there is a difficulty, you remove from his flesh what was united to it, but it is known that he has a soul endowed with reason and intelligence; or, you cannot say he is foreign to suffering.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, if Peter, that first pillar of the holy apostles, had not known clearly that the incarnate Word, he who also suffered for us, is one Christ, he would not have said of him in his epistle: "Christ suffered for us in the flesh"<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>, but he would have spoken as of two Christs; therefore the Christ who suffered for us is he who is of the seed of David; for no one, speaking of a man who would not be identical with God, would rightly say that he suffered for us in the flesh; if he did not know that it is the same who, as God, is impassible, but, as man, is passible, he would not have added "in the flesh." For this unity of God the Word with the flesh is sublime and indivisible. It necessarily entails this determination, that is, this addition of specific difference, saying "in the flesh."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why also in the Acts of the Apostles, it is written that the same Peter said: "Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know—this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>. See therefore that he clearly and truly recognizes the same, man and also impassible God who cannot be seized by death. For if the same (being) were not immortal by nature, though mortal since he became flesh, he would not have said: "Because it was not possible for him to be held by it"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">He also said to the Jews in another passage: "You killed the Prince of life"<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>. Thus the same is at once passible in the flesh, and at once superior to suffering by the divinity and higher. By the fact that he is man, he is said to be raised by the Father. But in that he is God, (he is said) that he could not be taken by death.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Likewise Paul, when he wrote to the Romans, says that the Christ (was) from the Jews according to the flesh and, the same, God blessed forever. Amen<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>. But he also writes in the first letter to the Corinthians: "One Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things exist and we through him"<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>; and again in this passage to the Hebrews: "Jesus Christ yesterday, today the same and forever"<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>. Similarly also the divine John writing a letter says: "And we are in the True One, in his Son Jesus Christ: he is the true God and eternal life"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But Our Lord also cries out in the Gospels, he who is (son) of Abraham according to the flesh: "Before Abraham was, I am"<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>; and again: "No one has ascended to heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man"<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>, for, although he became flesh from Mary and consubstantial with us, however because of this unity with God the Word, when we eat the life-giving flesh of the Word. That is why he says: "He who eats me will also live because of me"<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Since therefore the sacred books of the Spirit know one Son who willingly descended to empty himself, who humbled himself for us to our poverty and who is no longer separated in anything from the flesh, which he united without confusion and without change or transformation, and that the same (being) does divinely the divine things and suffers humanly the human things, how, O you, perhaps by chance, according to this distrust of the pagans, when you consider the cross a folly<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> and think that it is not proper to say that God is the one who was crucified, (how) are you ashamed of these words, when you ought to be in admiration of what gives salvation to all that is under heaven? And you ask, in ignorance, as about someone who would have two sons and not one who suffered for us in the flesh: Who is the one who on the Cross said: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">If indeed he humbled himself, to the point of coming below the measure of poverty and becoming flesh<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>, according to the word of John, how would he refuse the words that suit the flesh, for which he endured the cross? Then indeed, as he is the first of our nature, he sent up prayers for all humanity, drawing upon the whole human race the mercy from above.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For we are those who were abandoned and despised, and who, by the transgression of Adam's commandment, had come to be enemies of God: slaves, we were then under the yoke, subjected to the tyranny of the Calumniator.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That he, in fact, did not say these things concerning himself, he testified clearly to us in that Psalm 21 which in advance in prophecy clearly proclaimed these words of the gospel concerning the redemptive suffering of Christ, in these terms: "God, my God, listen to me, why have you abandoned me? My salvation is far from the words of my sins"<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>. But how could Christ rightly say these words about himself, or for what personal faults would he pray, he who did not commit sin and in whose mouth no deceit was found<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Is it not so for those who are not very familiar with the divine books? It is clear that it is for us, who have sinned, who have been in faults and crimes, because of the transgression of Adam's commandment, that he said that. How then is it not above all astonishing, the immensity of such a gift? He who knew no sin<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> ascended the cross; and again: The handwriting of sins that was against us, he tore it up<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>. He vanquished the Calumniator, for the latter found nothing in him that belongs to him. For us he appeased the Father, by sending up these words that suited our race: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Otherwise, how would he be called "mediator of God and men"<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>, the Emmanuel? For the mediator is the one who brings closer those who are far apart. But how would he bring together, if he does not accompany each of the parties that are divided? By generation<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>, he is to the Father by essence and by divinity; but the same is consubstantial with us by humanity. He alone sufficed and in truth could, to say, on behalf of our nature deprived of freedom, these words that invite us to reconciliation, and to pacify by the cross what is on earth with what is in heaven<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>, as Paul says.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For what seems to you smallness, are such words that he cried out for us on the cross. And for that you cut the Only Son in two! So that you attribute to him who is of the seed of David, as these adversaries are accustomed to say, what suits a man abandoned by God. What we understand through piety and in truth, is proven to us as worthy of God. For it was neither an ambassador, nor an angel who saved us, but the Lord God<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>, who came manifestly<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>, as the prophet Isaiah and David said. By him indeed, as by the head of our race, we have been freed from the accusations. Therefore by him, as by him who has purified us from all stain, we dare to cry to the Father of heaven: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore you did not understand that for us he took upon himself this defense in a divine manner; you made it an occasion for blasphemy, by lowering him who is great, for he is great, even if because of you he said humble words. For, that it is not he who, at the moment when he suffered, was abandoned by the Father, you can see clearly when he said to his disciples going to the saving cross voluntarily: "Behold, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, that you will be scattered, each to his own, and will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me"<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">How then will we not miss the mark and rightly bear the condemnation of impiety, with words that are opposite to the sacred expressions of Our Lord, and by saying he was abandoned by his Father, when he says: "I am not alone, because the Father is with me"<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>; likewise also, what he will say: "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me"<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>, is not from one who fears death, but from one who speaks of the economy. And by these words he excited the Calumniator, so that the cross would nail Him who was about to become the Savior of the whole world. For (the devil), because he had deceived Adam, by making him hope that he would be God if he tasted the forbidden fruit from which he was kept away, expected to circumvent him as a man, when he met him at the temptation, whereas the same is God by nature. But this refusal of the cup also prepared the shameless excuse of the Jews, for they said: If he had not manifested this refusal (of the cup), we would not have sinned, in crucifying him who ran to suffering and seized it voluntarily.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But in these words there is found another kind of teaching, very worthy of God: for it is with a view to our progress, as in a figure, that he said these (words), teaching us concerning the dangers relative to religion: Do not fear for your soul, do not run after misfortunes, but pray that the cup of death may pass. But if it does not pass, let us receive it courageously and say: "Not as I will, but as you will"<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>. That these things are indeed a teaching and not the fact of fear, is what the book of the gospels clearly testifies: How indeed would he fear death, he who with sovereign desire went to that death saying: "I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover"<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>. And to Peter who could not bear the prediction of the cross and said: "Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you!" with very violent reproaches, (Jesus) said: "Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man"<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore the fact of asking of each Christ who is the one who said: "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me"<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>; or who is the one who was nailed on the cross and who said: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>, is the fact of the paganism of Nestorius and of those who divide into two natures, hypostases and prosopa this unique Christ. But consider how Nestorius interrogates as someone who seizes opportunities to fear a mixture and takes pretext that there are occasions of faults: "Who is the one who also endured the slaughter? I am constrained to use less elevated words, so that all may know what is being spoken of. To whom does what is accomplished happen, tell me? If it is to the nature of the divinity, how do you dare to mix the two? Although the God Word remained incomprehensible to the Jews, and in the slaughter he did not participate in the flesh, whence, tell me, do you introduce the mixture?"<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">And in another passage again, the same Nestorius interrogates impiously concerning this (verse): "They will look on him whom they have pierced"<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>, saying: "What then is wounded? The side? But the side belongs to the body and not to the divinity." And again of this the blessed Paul asking clearly: "Who is the one who is crucified? Listen therefore to this word which is clearer: 'For he was crucified because of weakness, but he lives by the power of God'<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>. If he was crucified by weakness, who is weak, O heretic? God the Word?"</p>

        <p class="paragraph">In the same way also the wretched Theodoret poses the question to him in his refutation of the tenth chapter of Saint Cyril: "Who then is the one who went to the height of the works of perfection without being of a perfect nature? Who is the one who in the temptation learned obedience<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup>, and who did not know it before the temptation? Who is the one who lives with fear, who offers prayers with tears and who cannot save himself, but beseeches him who could save him and asks to escape death"<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For this kind of impious interrogation, he also made use of the tome of Leo; he who ratified that sterile assembly of those who gathered together at Chalcedon. For he asks: "What nature pierced by the nails hangs on the wood of the cross?"<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>, because there is no change in his question: Who and which? It is the same question as that of those who say two natures: according to the words of the impious Theodoret, let that be clear! For having said in the refutation of the tenth chapter of Saint Cyril: "In the temptation participated in our sufferings that nature which from us and for us was taken, and not he who took this nature for our salvation", in the refutation of the twelfth chapter, he says: "Therefore it is not God who suffered, but the man who was taken from us by God."<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">You see that the nature is the man whose nature was taken, once he has clearly shown that those who say that Christ has two natures, say that he also has two prosopa, and as for them there is no change to these (natures), they ask: Who and which? what the tome of Leo of Chalcedon also affirms. Know the nature, the prosopon also is easy to learn by that. For to him who asks: What nature hung on the wood of the cross? he has answered above. "For as this God does not undergo change by the fact of having pity, so this man is not swallowed up by the greatness of the divine power." Those therefore who divide God who became incarnate because of us into the duality of natures after the union, are accustomed to ask: Who and which?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But for those who know that the Emmanuel (is) one prosopon, one hypostasis, one nature which became incarnate of God the Word, such a kind of question which divides into two this unique indivisible Christ is esteemed by them as contempt and calumny. For the fact of asking about the Unique: Who or which? is an evident absurdity, for the Word of God who became incarnate and inhumanned, hanging on the wood, was pierced with nails in suffering in the flesh what is of our (nature).</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For this is also the reason why he became incarnate, not being susceptible of suffering in what he was and is God; if indeed even after the inhumanation, the Word of God were not corporeal and did not struggle with God, you would well say that the side which was pierced by the soldier's lance was of the body and not of the divinity. But if he who was without body by nature became corporeal by the economy because of us without change, this body is indeed his and this side of the body, in every way also, is indeed his. Why then do you separate from him the flesh, apart, and ask, in the manner of a sophist: Whose is this side? While you say he is non-corporeal even after the inhumanation, because of the Word of God.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">He therefore, he who became incarnate because of us, with tears and fear, offers supplications for us<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup> when he said: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup>? For if you think that he is calumniated and debased by these words and because of his voluntary tears, is it then also an opprobrium the incarnation, that is, the inhumanation, for which also he said these things? And why, when you concede this first point, do you accuse this second? But Paul, knowing that it was God who suffered this voluntarily, says: "In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death"<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup>; and he does not say this of a man who would not be at the same time God. In the same way therefore as he who before the days of his flesh was without flesh, took upon himself, because of us, to say and to suffer that for which he became incarnate, once he took upon himself the suffering of the weak, he went to the end of the suffering of the strong, so that it is the same who is voluntarily weak in the flesh and who is strong divinely.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But they persist in the same impudence and ask again, thinking they are enclosing us in difficulty and in a dead end: Who is the one who brought the thief into paradise? But we, taking the orthodox thought and the book inspired by the Spirit, having the care to walk in the footsteps of the initiators of the mysteries of the Church, we say this: God the Word wanting to save us completely and having become incarnate of the Holy Spirit and Mary, mother of God and virgin, did not unite only a flesh, but (a flesh) animated by a soul endowed with reason and intelligence. That is why this incarnation, we also call it an inhumanation by professing that he let fall nothing of the human essence, but he united it entirely to himself, for he was in all things like us, except sin<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup>. For Adam was neither without soul, nor without intelligence, when he transgressed the commandment and slipped into the snare of death. Therefore when he had need of healing, Adam had need not half but in his totality as a living rational being, so that one may say that it is the whole work that the Word of God took, in this hypostatic union and which was saved. As in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup>, according to the word of the wise Paul.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore God the Word, when he humbled himself to the voluntary kenosis, became man without change and salvation came to us by all that had been prepared for us, he also took upon himself to come to the test of death, to which we were bound because of sin; and that is why Paul says: "For the death he died he died to sin, once for all"<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup>, not indeed that he died because of a personal sin, he who knew no sin<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup>, but he paid the debt in our place to blunt the sting of sin<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> and destroy the empire of death. Therefore he died our death. But our death is the separation of the soul from the body. That is why indeed he had also cried out with the power worthy of God: "I lay down my life for my sheep, and no one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again"<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup>. And he says again concerning the cross: "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit"<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup>, and, saying this, he gave up his spirit, whereas in this also he did not despise the measure of the smallness of humanity; but it is the departure of our soul that by these words he wanted to sanctify, so that for us also, when we leave this life, he may entrust to the hands of the heavenly Father our spirits which will no longer be imprisoned in the nets of death and in the chains of sin. For the firstborn is for us all good and does all for us.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For if we said, according to the ineptitudes of the heresies concerning the departure of the spirit of Christ, that it is not the salvation of the soul, but the salvation of the divinity, it is not our death that would have died, but his death, and in vain would we glory in the suffering of our Savior, if, by a foreign death, and not by that which was ours, he had vanquished the Calumniator; but it is quite certain that what procured for us the victory, that also will make us be called again, for his soul was not abandoned to Sheol, nor did his flesh see corruption<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup>, as the prophet says, but on the one hand, the soul was separated from the body by the will of him who conducted things, and God the Word on the other hand, for it is he who directed them, united each of the (elements) by a sovereign unity hypostatically, since he is the fullness, he is not divided in a place, as incorporeal, infinite and capable of filling all.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">By this union on the one hand, concerning the body, he destroys corruption and gives life again to those who are in the tombs: for the bodies of many deceased saints rose<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup>, as the sacred Scripture says. Concerning his soul, on the other hand, he opens paradise and makes enter with him the thief to whom he had promised it saying: "Today you will be in paradise"<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup>, but he added: with me, and very rightly. For if the first Adam, because of sin, was banished and thrown into exile outside the dwelling of paradise, it was not lawful that another enjoy the delights of on high, before the second Adam rose for him and delivered him from that exile.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore God the Word, in uniting to himself a soul hypostatically, does not leave the body empty nor deprived of the union proper to it; he opened paradise to the thief and went to the land of sheol, saying to those who were in bonds: "Come out," and to those who were in darkness: "Show yourselves"<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup>! Having accomplished all that in fullness and in healing, he brought back again to unity what voluntarily he had separated, he who is one of two, of divinity and of humanity, which he possesses in a perfect way, according to their concept. He made shine for us the rays of the resurrection, that sun of righteousness<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But it is necessary that besides what has been said, a question on this verse be still explained. For some say: How do we say that the thief entered paradise, when the apostle Paul, in the letter to the Hebrews, considers that the just enumerated from of old were justified by faith; and he adds afterwards: "All these, though commended through their faith, did not receive what was promised, since God had provided something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect"<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Some say (to that) that the apostle did not put the thief with those he enumerated, but passed him over in silence, as having already merited what was promised. For that he did not say simply and without adding a difference: "All those who have been witnessed by faith, have not received the promises," but he said: "All these," applying his phrase by the use of the demonstrative to those only who were enumerated and counted and among whom the thief was not numbered.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But others say: The thief has not yet merited the dwelling in paradise, but, because of his sincerity and the intrepidity of his confession, Our Lord spoke to him thus: "Today you will be with me in paradise"<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup>. For he said: "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away"<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup>. For, there is, they say again, in the words of Our Lord, a similar manner of speaking of the future, as already existing, as when he says: "Whoever does not believe is condemned already"<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup>, and again: "Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life"<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Others also forcefully draw this verse to this meaning saying that we must put a punctuation mark<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup>, to read: "Truly, I say to you today." And then add this: "You will be with me in paradise"<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup>, so that this promise seems to aim at the future time. That is what they say.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But the true exegesis is this: these goods which are promised to us are the kingdom of heaven and not [the delights of paradise]. For when Our Lord preached: "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand"<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup>, he said it, without (speaking) of entry or exit into paradise; and he commanded us to pray and to say: "Your kingdom come"<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup>, without there being question of sojourn in paradise.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But perhaps someone will say: The kingdom of heaven and paradise, it is the same thing, because they are two appellations of one reality which is the same in its foundation. But the teaching of the sacred Scriptures shows that it is not the same thing, and that the difference between the two is considerable. For on the one hand, the goods which in the kingdom of heaven are prepared for those who love Our Lord, no eye has seen them, no ear has heard them, they have not ascended into the heart of anyone<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup>, as the divine Paul wrote. On the contrary, paradise, even the eye of Adam saw it, even his ear heard it, for he heard: "You may surely eat of every tree of the garden"<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup>, although he had in view only one tree, but he was not commanded to eat of it. And even it ascended into his heart, for he was commanded to cultivate paradise<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup>. For the cultivation of paradise was not any manual cultivation, but an intellectual pleasure was joined to it, as well as the delights of divine thoughts. And I pass over in silence the rapture that Paul had there, since he said: "Whether in the body or out of the body I do not know"<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Likewise, this thief merited paradise, for he is not a liar who said: "Today you will be with me in paradise"<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup>; and, these goods in hope of the kingdom of heaven, like the just of old who did not receive the promises, he too awaited them and did not receive them, because God foresees for us a better lot, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For, that these goods which are kept for us in the promises are nothing other than the kingdom, one can see it from many passages, especially from these words that Our Lord, it is written in the gospel of Luke, said to his disciples: "You are those who have stayed with me in my trials, and I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom, that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom"<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But, with this kingdom which is promised to us, we also have paradise which is a place of spiritual rest: there is therefore place to be in admiration before the sovereignly wise dispositions of Our Lord, of which we have received some mitigated gleams, whereas we cannot speak of them completely. For, when this thief showed such faith, and despised the suffering of the nails, for he was nailed to that cross both by the hands and by the feet, he passed over all that was at his feet and flew towards those future hopes, by crying these magnificent and admirable words which surpass man: "Remember me, Lord, when you come into your kingdom"<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup>! He who examines scrupulously our thoughts, admiring the greatness of the prayer and the sublimity of the faith of the (thief) from what was about to happen immediately, confirmed him in the hope of what was about to come by saying: "Today you will be with me in paradise"<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For, these others who believe in me, he said, have benefited from signs and teachings, and thereby have received the word concerning the kingdom. But that one, whereas he heard and saw nothing concerning me, except the ignoble death by the cross, pronounces that generous word: "Remember me, Lord, when you come into your kingdom"<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup>! What then? That he have at once delights in paradise, as a dwelling and a pledge because of his faith? But he will also obtain in the end the kingdom in which he begged to be remembered.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">In the same way as a hero returns victorious, hastening, running to make his entry into the city and carrying on him the trophies and what he has taken as best from the booty, wanting to render thereby his victory brilliant, very joyful and very glorious, by announcing the promises of victory, so also Our Lord hastening and about to enter the first dwelling of man, I mean paradise, brings this thief, this trophy more famous and more glorious than a whole panoply, and, of all that was snatched from the Calumniator, that which has more value than all, realizing in fact what he had said: "When he has bound the strong man, then he will plunder his house"<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">When the spirits of the just hear these words, those whose venerable dust is here deposited leap with hope, and exult with you who are the Church of God. That is why indeed our Fathers also, on the solemn day of Easter, or again after the feast of the Resurrection, decreed to gather first in the place called cemetery<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup>, given that by their actions they have profoundly known the frequentation of Christ and his resurrection and they have shown that death was a sleep: also, when he returns, he will say to each of those who are lying here what is written: "Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you"<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup>. These are they who having sent up prayers now for us, will contain this wrath that weighs on us and put to flight this corruption that causes perish. Let us pray again to merit with them the kingdom of heaven, by the goodness and charity of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, to whom be glory and power forever and ever. Amen.</p>
