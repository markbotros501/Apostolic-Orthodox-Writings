    <h1>Homily 14: In Honor of the Holy Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">Delivered in memory of the holy Mother of God and ever-Virgin Mary.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">1. It is beautiful and fitting that we offer words of praise to all the saints. Let us therefore honor them with laudatory discourses and solemnities, as people who have truly served their Master and have faithfully contributed to the Economy of our salvation. Let us first praise the prophets, as those who by their own perfection appeared sufficient to proclaim in advance the great mystery of piety<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>; then, the apostles, as those who announced this mystery; finally, the martyrs, as those who by their own blood confirmed the prophecies of the former and the preaching of the latter. Therefore, for having thus confirmed (the words of both), they also received this name, for it is customary to call "martyrs" witnesses who by their word give credence to facts that cannot be demonstrated or are not objects of faith in any way.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">2. Now the word of the martyrs of Christ is the effusion of their blood, which followed the first and divine effusion of the blood shed for us by the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>, who testified for Himself before others. Now He had no need of it, He who testified a good confession before Pontius Pilate<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, as the Apostle Paul says, and very rightly; for what other witness much more faithful than Himself should He need, He who is Himself the Truth<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>? Yet by accepting the generosity of His servants, He associated them with this title which is His own and had them called martyrs.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">3. As for the Mother of God, truly holy and ever-virgin Mary, how can we not honor her as a prophetess, as an apostle, and as a martyr? As a prophetess, according to the prophecy of Isaiah which says concerning her: "And I drew near to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. And the Lord said to me: Call his name 'Spoil quickly, plunder speedily,' because before the child knows how to say 'father' and 'mother,' he will take the power of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria before the king of Assyria"<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">4. Now what is the prophetess mentioned in the divine books, who bore a son called "Spoil quickly, plunder speedily," a son who, as soon as born and before he knows how to say 'papa' and 'mama,' plunders the enemies and despoils them—(who is she), if not the Mother of God, the Virgin who bore Emmanuel, who, from the very beginnings of His birth according to the flesh<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>, overturned the Slanderer by taking the power of Damascus and carrying away the spoil of Samaria?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">5. These words symbolically designate idolatry by a kind of antonomasia: for Damascus is interpreted as "bloodthirsty," and Samaria is the city that fashioned the golden calves and caused the true worship and adoration of the one God<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> to disappear among its inhabitants. It is evident to all that these two facts characterize idolatry: in that we call and adore as gods (idols) made by the hands (of men) and in that we offer sacrifices through the medium of blood and burnt offerings. It is from this, then, that Emmanuel, as soon as He was born according to the flesh, takes the spoil, when, on the one hand, He drew the Magi to come adore Him in swaddling clothes in His infancy<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>, and on the other hand, He went into Egypt because of the massacre of the children by Herod and shook its idols made by the hands (of men)<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>, as Isaiah also prophesies. Now He did these things and took this spoil before the king of the Assyrians: for prophecy calls the Slanderer the king of the Assyrians in many passages, and one can find him thus surnamed, so to speak, everywhere in the prophets<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">6. Such is the child whom the prophetess Mary brought forth for us: from His earliest infancy and by His birth, He demolished the citadel of the Slanderer's tyranny. "And do not wonder"<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>, says Isaiah, for this child was the Mighty God, the Angel of the great counsel<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>, as one who reveals and manifests in Himself, as the living Word, the Father who is the intellect beyond all.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">7. He was the Wonderful Counselor<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>, as He who, together with the Father, made the spiritual creation and this visible world and who heard (these words) as sharing His counsel and His honor: "Let us make man in our image and after our likeness"<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>. The Mighty God<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>, as He who is the power of the invisible Father—for Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>—and who rightly can hear: "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of righteousness"<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>. He was the Prince of Peace<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>, as He who united earthly things with heavenly things and pacified all things by the blood of His cross<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>, as Paul says. The Father of the age to come<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>, as the beginning and (the one) who sowed the seed of the future life and of eternal and endless hopes, namely the kingdom of heaven which He preached.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">8. Therefore the Virgin and Mother, as she who bore such a child, both Lord of the prophets and her own Lord, prophesied, after Elizabeth's greeting, saying: "For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; because the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is His name. And His mercy is from generation to generation on those who fear Him"<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">9. On the other hand, she is an apostle, as one will call her, and one will even say, rightly, that she surpasses all the apostles: for from the beginning she was counted with the apostles themselves, as the book of Acts relates, saying: "These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with Mary the mother of Jesus"<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>. On the other hand, if that word which they heard from Our Lord: "Go, teach all nations"<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>, made those men apostles, what nation has this (Virgin) not taught and brought to the knowledge of God, and that, while remaining silent, by her singular, exceptional, and consequently resounding childbearing, and by her unequalled conception, which makes her the mother and root of the preaching of the gospel?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">10. She is a martyr, on the other hand, in many ways; let us not fear to say it: when she bore courageously the unjust judgment of Joseph, who thought that her conception had taken place through adultery, before knowing through the angel's revelation the mystery of the childbearing<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>, and also when, before the fury of Herod, she fled into Egypt<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>, then returned from Egypt and departed for Nazareth<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>, and again while she lived daily with the murderous Jews<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> and led a life that was very close to death.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">11. How, therefore, is it not right that we render honor: to her whom the spirits of the just now honor? The patriarchs, on the one hand, (honor her) as she who fulfilled the hope in which they had long persevered and who brought the blessing of the seed of Abraham, namely Christ, (a blessing) which extended to all peoples and all lands. The prophets, on the other hand, honor her as she who enlightened their prophecies and bore the sun of righteousness<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>, who revealed secret, hidden, and unknown things. The apostles, on the other hand, (honor her) as her whom they recognized as the principle of their preaching. The martyrs (honor her) as she who was the first to bring them the example of struggles and crowns. The doctors of the Church, on the other hand, and the shepherds of Christ's rational sheep (honor her), as she who shuts the mouth of heresy and who, as from a drinkable and pure source, makes the streams of Orthodoxy gush forth for us, and, first and foremost, drives away the darkness of the Manichaeans.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">12. For when the Word of God became incarnate from her without change, He showed that the Creator and author of our condition is one. For if, according to the blasphemous myths of those people, on the one hand, the good God is the author of the soul, and on the other hand, the evil principle as well as the uncreated darkness are the authors of the body, how did the Son of the Father and the Good God come, as it is written, to partake of blood and flesh<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>, in our condition? But as they cannot bear the reproach thus (formulated), they run to take refuge in the fictions that the impious Eutyches reviewed and inherited as a paternal possession. For they say that He appeared rather in figure, that Emmanuel Himself did not truly become man, thus contradicting the divine books and the sacred book of the gospels, according to which the holy Virgin, by showing herself to be the instrument of the mystery of the divine incarnation, destroys all the fiction of their chatter.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">13. For the Word did not take her into the service of (His) Economy to give us a shadow and a chimera, but true flesh consubstantial with us, which He hastened to heal and renew. For if He had wished to use an illusion, what need was there of Mary? On the other hand, what need was there still of conception, or of gestation for nine months, or of childbearing, of swaddling clothes, of breasts, of milk, of the age of earliest infancy and of growth? Now this uncreated being truly took upon Himself all these things for us, voluntarily submitted to the laws of human nature which He Himself had established, and passed through all these states which are ours, except sin<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>, so that, by placing in all of us the freedom and blessing which are His, He might destroy the sin that was upon our race, the slavery that resulted from it, and the curse.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">14. This is what Moses, the adversary and enemy of the very impious Manichaeans, also showed very clearly. For he saw a bush that was in flames and yet was not burning, which prefigured in advance the indivisible union of God the Word with human creature, (a union) undertaken by charity and accomplished without change. Now the bush is a thorny plant, which shows that the (Word) participated, sin apart, in the thorny nature and subject to sin because of Adam's transgression of the commandment, in order to transmit to us also the strength against sin, since He was named the second Adam and became the firstfruits of the new creation as He was of the first.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">15. The Virgin herself rejects and drives away, as impure, from the sacred dwellings, the madness of Apollinaris, who affirms that our Savior Christ is without a (human) spirit. For while the Virgin herself is a living being endowed with reason, who can receive intelligence and knowledge—for this is man—she gave birth to God who became incarnate without change as a small child endowed with reason and intelligence, in order to give us the gift of total salvation, (to us who are) endowed with reason. For truly God the Word also would deserve to be accused of lacking reason, if He had left His own image, that is, our condition as rational beings, without healing, by distancing it from the divine union, by taking flesh without reason and by judging this (flesh) alone worthy of salvation.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">16. But the Virgin, Mother of God, also does not consent to bear the folly of Nestorius. For how is she not the Mother of God, she who gave birth as a child to the Mighty God, the Angel of the great counsel, the Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty One, the Prince of Peace, the Father of the age to come<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>? "But," he says, "it is not proper for a woman to give birth to God"<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>. — If you mean without a body, I too say it with you. But if you say (that she gave birth to Him) with a body, do not hesitate in the face of this marvel. For a woman cannot give birth to a soul alone and separate without a body; but when she unites in marriage and becomes one thing with the body by a simultaneous production, she gives birth (to the soul) together with the body; and therefore it is rightly and truly that she is said to be the mother, not of the flesh alone, but of the rational man. Think also the same thing concerning the birth of Emmanuel according to the flesh; for thus the sacred book teaches us, saying: "Since therefore the children have partaken of blood and flesh, He Himself likewise partook of the same things"<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">17. For it is not the beginning of His divinity that God the Word received from Mary, for He was without beginning and author of every age and every time. But when He chose for Himself to become incarnate and to become man, that is, to unite hypostatically to Himself the flesh consubstantial with us, animated by a soul endowed with reason and intelligence, the Virgin brought forth at the same time what comes from her own creation, all that belongs to woman, to bring it forth together with the nature. And the Holy Spirit, since there was no union with a husband, acted as author and accomplished the childbearing Himself. Thus the Word God Himself, when He was conceived and born according to the flesh, made Mary the Mother of God in that she gave birth to the Word endowed with a body; and it is according to what is best and admirable that she is named, for the mystery itself consisted in this, namely the victory of what is best, the elevation of our race that results from it, and its achievement.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">18. This is why He who was born as a child was also called Emmanuel, since He is one without division and without confusion, of two natures, namely divinity and humanity. How could He who, while possessing all things unique and indivisible, (namely first) the incorporeal birth from the Father and the same divinity—for only He was born of the Unique and God from God—then the birth from the Virgin—for only He was born of an unmarried woman and of this woman only—how did He not violate the virginity of His mother when He was born according to the flesh, (how, I say) would He Himself, after the ineffable union, be divided and broken by the duality of natures, as the Council of Chalcedon taught, which clung to the ineptitudes of Nestorius? But He is totally one and unique. That is why He called us, who were separated from God, to union and peace, when He became mediator between God and men<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">19. This is why we also honor the holy Mother of God and ever-Virgin Mary with very remarkable honors, as she who is found capable, more than all the other saints, of causing prayers to ascend for us, (as she) also whom we boast of having obtained as the ornament of our race: Rational Earth, from which the second Adam, who is neither fashioned nor created, formed Himself according to the flesh<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup>, Virgin Plant, from which Christ, the heavenly ladder, was formed according to the flesh by the Spirit, so that we ourselves, by fixing our steps upon His, might be able to ascend to the heavens<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>, Spiritual Mountain of Sinai, which is not in the flames, but which shines with the sun of righteousness<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup> and gives as a gift not only the Law of the ten commandments, but the Legislator Himself<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup>, when He appeared on earth and conversed with men<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup>, and it is not a people, nor Israel alone, but every people and every race that He instructs by the gospel and captivates by persuasion.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">20. What honor, then, shall we render to the Mother of God, or rather to God who became incarnate from her for our salvation? For it is there that He finds honor, sacrifice, and burnt offering. For how is it not beautiful that, by His coming in the flesh, the earth became heaven, so that even the angels also dwell on this (earth), according to what He Himself also said in the gospel: "Truly, truly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending"<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">21. But we, who were bound to show a kind of life worthy of heaven, we do not even do what is fitting for the earth, but (only) what is fitting for Sheol and the abyss of perdition? While we ought to apply ourselves to virginity and observe it because of God who was born of a virgin, we do not even restrain in a chaste marriage the lusts that the cross of Christ has blunted and made easy to overcome, since it has blunted the sin which is the sting of death<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup>, but we dishonor the temple of God<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup> by fornication, and we become horses that neigh after mares<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup>, as a prophet says.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">22. But I ask and beg you: do not make this futile pleasure, which passes as soon as it is accomplished and leaves sadness, into an unquenchable flame and endless torment. But let each of us possess our vessel in holiness and honor<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup>, as says Paul who is wise in all things, that we may obtain eternal goods by the grace and charity of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, to whom belongs praise with the Father and the Holy Spirit unto ages of ages. Amen!</p>
