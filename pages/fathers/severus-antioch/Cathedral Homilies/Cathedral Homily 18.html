    <h1>Homily 18: On the Forty Holy Martyrs</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">By the same Saint Severus: Concerning the manner in which the commemoration of the holy martyrs during the holy fast of the forty days was established by the holy canons; and on the forty holy martyrs. It was delivered on a Saturday.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Let no one among you be surprised that I lead you out to this temple of the martyrs, illustrious in their victory, given that our fathers prescribed in the ancient canons that during these forty days of fasting, one should not hold an assembly for the victory of the martyrs. For if we have done so, it is not in opposition to the laws, for it is permitted on Saturday and Sunday, even during the full fast, to offer the bloodless sacrifice and to make commemoration of the holy martyrs<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. I say further that a law is judged not by its words, but rather by its spirit<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. And the spirit of this law is this: it is not because of the commemoration of the martyrs that we would succumb to passion and come to the tavern and gluttony, to the point of interrupting our training in fasting. For those who establish a law not only promulgate what is proper to the law but also foresee in advance.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Nothing is more fitting for fasting than the heroic deeds of the martyrs, and it is no wonder that the martyrs loved fasting, the privation of food, and all other trials of endurance, which are the good preparatory exercises for their combat. They would indeed greatly rejoice and be happy if we celebrated all their commemorations with such penitence. But because we would balk at the labors of perfection and it would not be the majority who would hasten to assemble for the solemnity of the martyrs if they were commanded to fast even on that day, for this reason (our Fathers), condescending to the weakness of our nature and imitating their Master who endured the cross to grant us freedom, allowed us to rejoice and feast in memory of their combat.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">On the other hand, this very fact of rejoicing and feasting in memory of the martyrs is not outside the laws of the Spirit either. For before we received the certain hope, or rather the pledge of the resurrection, namely the resurrection of Christ from the dead after three days, death was death, and the mourning that followed contained absolutely no consolation. But when He who is God and the Word appeared for us through His coming in the flesh, accomplished the economy concerning us, and loosed the bonds of Sheol, death itself became a sleep, and departure from this world became above all a feast and not a mourning. He who threatened the perfidious Jews through the prophet and said, "I will change your feasts into mourning"<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>, has made our mournings into solemnities; and (these are) especially those who have prepared themselves by a good and virtuous life for the resurrection, like the martyrs. Therefore, it is with joy and full of all gladness that in the cycle of each year we celebrate the death of the martyrs, dancing and singing with the prophet David and saying with true faith: "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">We must therefore know both the object and the terms and the spirit of the canons and laws of the Church. And thus we will understand whether what is done or said by us conforms to the legislation, and we will not become blind like the Jews—will we rely only on the letter and cling to it, closing our eyes to the beauty of the thoughts within?—(like the Jews, I say), who accused our Lord, God and Savior Jesus Christ, of violating the Sabbath, because He deigned to heal on that day those who had infirmities and diseases, while they knew exactly neither the terms nor even the spirit of the Law.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, the Law, when it gave orders concerning the feast of Unleavened Bread and commanded to do no work during these seven feast days as well as the Sabbath, said in Leviticus: "You shall do no servile work"<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>; but in Exodus and in Deuteronomy, as if to indicate the meaning of this saying, it expressed itself in this manner: "You shall do no work during (these days)"<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>, "however, all the things that will be done for the soul, those only shall be done by you"<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>, so that it might be well known that a servile work signifies not the profit and healing of the soul, but the satisfaction of a pleasure of the flesh and an enjoyment, or the practice of a trade, whether in agriculture, commerce, or other similar professions, to which we pass our life—this is what was truly forbidden to do on the Sabbath day.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But the act of healing the paralysis of the body or leprosy, how does it not aim at the salvation of the soul, bowed down by the suffering of the body in a pitiable manner? Therefore, Jesus, the legislator and physician, who knew better than those who blasphemed the religious interpretation and the spirit of His Law which He Himself had brought and established, questioned those unintelligent Jews for their confusion, saying: "I ask you: On the Sabbath day, is it permitted to do good, or to do evil? To save a soul, or to kill it?"<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></p>
    </div>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, let no one accuse us in a Jewish manner because we celebrate the memory of the holy forty martyrs during these days of fasting! Although in truth it is not permitted to us to do so for other martyrs, nevertheless it is legitimate for these forty martyrs; for they are the children of these forty days of fasting, because each day has borne for us an athlete and a martyr. And indeed it is during these (days) in which they fought, that by their holiness and courage they showed themselves strong and were equal to such a combat. It is therefore just that the fathers rejoice in the combats of their children, that we are not unjust towards them, and that we do not assign the memory of these to other days.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Let all learn that the discipline of fasting knows how to lead and train children to martyrdom, and not (only) one or two, but a whole group in its entirety and an assembly of soldiers and a troop of (men), armed with the whole mystical panoply, they indeed who appeared in public when the judge at that time had them brought and appear before him, different in race and body, but equal in spiritual age and having attained to the perfect man<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>, according to the word of Paul.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why also in combat they were equal in ardor and attention as armed (men), as well as in vigilance as valiant men who know the rules of combat and (know) how to attack enemies, who have learned in the manner of the Apostle to bring every thought into captivity to Christ<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>, and (who) transferred and placed their experience of (temporal) combats into the course of eternity.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And while they spoke to the one who presided as a tyrant, from among them two, they made their spokesmen, having placed them as if at the front of the whole troop, while they themselves lined up behind them, and thus they trusted in what was said. One was named Candius, and the other, Curion<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>; and the two were formed to lead soldiers from a spiritual point of view.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">On the one hand, whenever the judge used flattery, they gave very firm replies, fearing that flattery itself might slacken the energy of their courage; but, whenever (the judge) changed (his tone) to become more cruel, growing angry with threats and at the same time also adding grave wounds with orders even to strike them in the face with stones, then those in turn, adapting anew, articulated (their) replies with fitting calm, imitating our God and incarnate Master, who said to the servant who struck Him on the cheek: "If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why do you strike me?"<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">O model of patience, which can arouse imitation, but which surpasses all imitation! For even if someone imitates Him exactly in everything, the palm will still revert to Him, because He was God and voluntarily submitted to His lot.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, we too, having learned the tactics of the martyrs, let us grow angry against fornication which softens, and, before the fury which makes us fierce like wild beasts, let us train ourselves in calm; for there exists, even now, if we wish it, a time for martyrdom.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Then, after the judge had noted that neither ferocity had terrified the martyrs, nor flattery had managed to conquer them, but (that they) had guessed his ruse, mocked what his mind had made him find, and called him Agricolaos, a word from the Latin language, so that he might be named thus suitably in the Greek language, because he was fierce and a flatterer<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>, then, transported with great fury, he enumerated all the various and usual instruments of torture; but seeing that everything, in the same manner, was turned into derision and contempt, he resorted in his mind to a strange kind of torment, in order to weave for the martyrs a double crown: one, because the tortures that are habitual appeared as little because of their valor and perfection; the other, because they endured with constancy and strength an unaccustomed torment.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">In the open air and naked, indeed, they received the order to spend the whole night; bitten by the breath of the north wind, which was very sharp, and covered by frost and fine snow; and they remained patiently in the pond, assaulted by the waves. On the one hand, they were frozen by the frost; on the other hand, all (the sufferings) assaulted them at the same time for a certain death, a single one of them being sufficient to lead them to complete disappearance and corruption.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But on this snow and on this lake, these valiant men imagined themselves to be as if on a soft bed. And, while the extremities of their members were chapped and burned by the cold and the warmth of their body withdrew inside themselves, they sent outward the flame of their spirit and enveloped their dying body with it; and the warmth of faith increasing as their body grew cold, warmly heated the athletes; they represented in spirit the gnashing of teeth, object of the threat of eternal torment, and counted for nothing the rigor of a temporary cold.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">If by chance one among them was drawn by pain to complain and groan, he heard his neighbor who, facing the pains, responded as an ascetic<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> with psalmody and prayer, and he immediately chanted psalms with him, responded at the same time with him as an ascetic and turned to the act of thanksgiving. Thus these good soldiers and comrades supported each other and kept unfailingly their mutual aid like in an army arrayed for battle.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">From on high, the Agonothete watched them, while at the same time the choir of angels rejoiced, prepared to (come) to meet them, and prepared for the athletes hymns of victory. And a light, descending from above, lit up and illuminated the stadium of the struggle, similar to that light which in truth our Lord Himself showed to the disciples on the mountain, when His face shone like the sun and His garments became white as light<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>; for He loves to glorify His true servants as Himself.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">In truth, crowns also descended for the combatants, equal in number to them with only one exception. Indeed, one of them, after having succumbed under the torments and faltered, went hastily towards the bath which was nearby; and immediately, at the instant he felt the warmth of the bath, he died, his flesh having burst; he thus died a double death: the first, that of sin, which is eternal and by which the soul dies; the second, that which delivers from this vain and ephemeral life.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Certainly those who were his comrades in arms groaned; troubled by sadness, they did not rejoice at the sight of the celestial light and did not give themselves over to joy in the presence of the crowns; but, as disciples of Christ who love (their) brothers, they wept over the departure and loss of their brother and over the dissolution of their group and of the sacred number of "forty".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">But the fathers<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> who love (their) children, I mean the forty days of fasting, finding themselves capable of some prowess because of the incarnate God who fasted those (days), were not indifferent to the pain and misery of their children whom they had conceived through frost and snow; but immediately they conceived and bore another and made him enter in place of the one who perished.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Such indeed is spiritual childbirth: even before a premature birth can occur, there is suddenly conception and at the same time childbirth and again birth pangs for the same being, many times: thus it was with Paul, who wrote to the Galatians: "My children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth, until Christ is formed in you"<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>. The prophet Isaiah also shows this kind of childbirth which is accomplished very quickly, saying: "Because of your fear, O Lord, we have conceived and we have been in the pains of childbirth and we have brought forth the Spirit of your salvation which you have wrought on the earth"<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But let us see what was this admirable childbirth of the fasts, which consoled the martyrs. A man was sitting outside and remained assiduous in guarding this bath: he looked towards the icy stadium<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> of the athletes, in order to welcome the fugitives who (might come out) from the struggle and leave the ranks, to (find) relief in the warm water; he thought of this and looked attentively, when he glimpsed a gleam and saw crowns descending; he was struck within himself and seized entirely by the beauty that appeared. Then, proclaiming himself a Christian, he threw himself into the midst of the martyrs, remaining gladly in the pond and in the frost and, so to speak, asking that the cold become even sharper, he manifested an eagerness of a certain candid ardor to be struck by a pious death, thinking of these words of Paul: "The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us"<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why he also realized his divine desire; and after having been baptized and led to perfection<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> in the struggles for piety, he flew away as a martyr with the martyrs and quickly saw Him whom he had so ardently loved.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Now is the time for David to sing: "This is the change of the right hand of the Most High"<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>. For how was there not a change, when the one who was so eager to procure this bath and to offer relief (to the victims) became a trainer in valor? Behold, the one who desired to welcome the deserters is enrolled among the valiant. Moses also will sing likewise on this subject, saying: "Your right hand, O Lord, is glorious in power"<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>. And Christ is the right hand of the Almighty Most High, who works such magnificent wonders.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But on the flower of this bath, let us alight a little like laborious bees, so that when we gather some profit from it, we may skillfully prepare with it a honeycomb of spiritual honey. For this is what the judge then imagined with perverse cunning, (namely) that nearby, as an attraction, there was the relief of a bath, which would show all the more the measure of the endurance of the martyrs.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For, on the one hand, he who, having renounced in his spirit, nevertheless has no regard for any escape, perhaps even without too much willing it, will show himself strong and persevere in the pains; on the other hand, he who, having rest nearby if he wished to change, and (who) chooses for himself suffering rather than ease, that one is properly speaking patient, but not the one who lives the ascetic life against his will, (favored) by the absence and lack of occasions (of falling).</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, absolutely no one has an excuse, saying: "We must go to the spectacle of horse races, because in truth it was recently granted to us"<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>. Now above all, indeed, show me your perfection? But if it is because of the absence of pleasure that you were not formerly a spectator of evil, I give thanks for the absence which (presented itself) then. As for you, even when you do not see the contest, I know that you are a lover of spectacles and that you always irritate God by your will, and—what is dreadful—it is during the holy days of fasting that (this happens), when we should abstain and live in repentance because of Him who suffered for us according to the flesh; for I omit to say that it is even during our whole life that we should have this conduct.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But now, we, on the one hand, recite the sacred prayers; and the theatre, on the other hand, resounds very loudly and makes (its) uproar echo in front of us even during the nights, with flutes, cymbals, and lascivious and satanic songs. How then can one not be more insensitive than stones to ask, when one sees this: Why has God withheld the rain? What love does He not deserve, that acting in this way we are still alive and still see the sun?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">But let us return to the martyrs. They can, indeed, by their prayers turn us away from perversity, drench the earth with rain, and chase away from our souls and bodies all infirmity and (all) disease. For these, indeed, after having sustained a beautiful struggle, after their death by cold and the departure of their spirits to Christ, this God of spirits and of all flesh, received the order from the judge to be burned by fire, for he refused us out of jealousy the blessing that would come from their holy members; servants therefore took the bodies of all the saints on a cart, but they left only one, who was still breathing after all these torments, imagining they could bring him back from his good purpose<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But his mother, having seen what had happened, anxious, forgetting (her) womanly weakness, despising the hardness of the persecutors, and preoccupied with only one thing, (namely) not to lose her son—for she judged it a loss that he should be left behind in this life—after lifting him with her hands and putting him on her shoulders, ran towards that cart, and threw him over his comrades in arms, saying: "Let the cart also carry my ear of grain, which I carried in my womb and brought into this world, (and) which now, after having carried him on my shoulders, I have sent to the resurrection: I will see him again there in a short time, and he will not leave me anymore, when he dwells in the eternal tabernacles"<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Let mothers who love the flesh and do not love (their) children hear, instruct themselves, and learn the hope of a mother, a (hope) that is manly and befits Christians, and let them hasten towards the future!</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But, so that the martyrs might sanctify all visible creation, a truly very cruel and (very) rigorous ordinance of this persecutor ordered that the venerable ashes from the flames and the remains of their half-burned bones be thrown into the river that flowed nearby. And, after they were thrown, the waters that received them kept them, and like a ship, directed towards a certain determined place, once they were gathered together, these precious relics which had been dispersed, (waters) which formerly also, when they were divided, made Israel pass as through dry land and which for the passage of the ark restrained (their) impetuosity and natural course<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">To these venerable ashes of the martyrs we must apply the word of the prophet Isaiah: "If you pass through the fire, the flame shall not burn you, and the rivers shall not sweep you away"<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>, (ashes) which in truth, once divided, have passed all frontiers—if someone finds himself possessing only a very small particle and like a little seed, he possesses in his home the forty martyrs themselves, casting a sorrowful and terrible glance against the demons— (ashes) which have the value of a remedy for those who are weak, which instruct and teach those who need teaching, which are a source of peace for those who are enemies of one another and (who) are angry, pacifying and charitable for those who ask and pray to obtain their intercession; for they have made themselves all things to all men<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>, wishing to profit everyone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">The panegyric of these (martyrs) was similarly done by the wise and great Basil<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>, doctor of the whole Church which is under heaven, when he praised the athletes of his region: in truth, he both brought excellent teachers and martyrs, receiving their (relics) as a blessing from God. Therefore, coming to what was said by the doctor, you have been delighted. And indeed, we too, it is with the help of this one that we have said these few words. And since you are content and delighted, praise Christ who is the source of all knowledge and (all) wisdom, to whom (belong) praise and power with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen!</p>
