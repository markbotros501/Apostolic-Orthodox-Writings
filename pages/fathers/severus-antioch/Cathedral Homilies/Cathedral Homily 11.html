    <h1>Homily 11: On the Holy Martyr Babylas</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">1 I do not know if one would be right to accuse us of lacking intelligence if we passed over in silence Babylas, the eloquent shepherd and martyr, the man who at once fulfilled in himself the words predicted by the Lord concerning those who were to believe in him, and who showed that they were truthful. First indeed, when our God and Savior Jesus Christ himself says: He who believes in me, as the Scripture says, rivers of living water will flow from his bosom<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>; this (Babylas) was so penetrated by this teaching and made flow such abundant streams, so generous in words and so filled with wisdom, that even the ears of the adversaries, gently seduced, found themselves inclined to listen to him, and the cursed tyrant, on his seat, before whom the combat of martyrdom unfolded, became a calmed and avid listener of his teachings, whereas, at first, his ears were closed by the worship of demons.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">2 Next, when the Master who does not lie said to his disciples of that time, and, through them, to those who have lived until now and to those who will come in all times to follow: You will be brought before governors and kings because of me, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>; Babylas—who is truly blessed—far surpassed the meaning of these words. For it was not by others that he was brought, but it was voluntarily that he abandoned everything for the stadium of martyrdom, when he already had the hair of an old man, as one could hear said, but his spirit was rejuvenated by his piety.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">3 For the tyrant, wanting suddenly to enter the church and fall like a wolf upon the flock of rational sheep, Babylas, standing then before the doors of the holy temple, immovable like an impregnable tower and like a powerful rampart that cannot be shaken by the assaults of furious waves, prevented him from entering.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">4 Taking him by the hand, so to speak, he said to him: “You must not approach the temple, nor mark with your impure footprints the threshold of the doors.” As I have said, he truly accomplished at once all the words of the divine book: this one: The righteous are bold as a lion<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>; and this (other): I will speak of your testimonies before kings and I will not be ashamed<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>; and that one: The good shepherd gives his life for his sheep<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>, and all the other words of the same kind as these and which are similar to them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">5 Just as a woman of beautiful appearance, who, thanks to her face and the beauty of her whole body, possesses a natural beauty, embellishes likewise everything she wears, being herself the principal ornament, and not being embellished, but brought into full light by what she wears, or rather, to say what is fitting, eclipsing and extinguishing by her natural beauty the brilliance that could come from her ornaments, so too, Babylas, that great athlete of piety, shining by the correctness and grace of the spirit, when he clothed himself with divine words, as with a brilliant ornament or garment, made them appear, all together and each in particular, even more brilliant, bringing to light and making appear what had until then only been heard by hearsay.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">6 And this, truly just as well when he adorned himself with a single one of these words, whichever you choose, so that he did not need others to make its beauty resplendent; and on the other hand, also, when he grouped them all together and brought them back to one and applied them to himself, setting them as if framed by a crown, in such a way that, when one of them is separated from the others, the whole ensemble is deprived of harmony and grace, the acts, but not the words, requiring a harmonious and overall beauty.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">7 For me, leaving aside all the rest, it is your way of teaching more than your other talents that makes my admiration. For, while the tyrant, in the very stadium of the combat of martyrdom, was blinded by impiety and, as if to mock and laugh, said addressing the saint—I will recall his impious words—: “Your Christ, when he hears that you have named one God, will he not be angered by what you have done?” (Babylas) changed and transformed this invective into theological language, saying with unveiled face, contemplating, as in a mirror, the glory of the Lord<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>, as Paul says. “Every time Christians name Christ, they also confess the Father, and every time they name the Father, they also confess the Son, for the Father is not distinct from the Son, nor the Son from the Father.”</p>

        <p class="paragraph">8 Upon hearing this, let the admirers and disciples of Arius blush, and let them know clearly that the faith and teaching of the apostles and martyrs knows the Son as consubstantial with God the Father. For if the Son is distinct from the Father in that he is Son, and that, on the one hand, in a particular hypostasis, so to speak, appears the person of the Father, and that, on the other hand, in a particular hypostasis, is found that of the Son, in what then will the Father be inseparable from the Son and the Son (inseparable) from the Father, as the blessed Babylas said, if not in that one thing belongs to both, namely the essence and the divinity.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">9 But perhaps you will say that it is in glory and in kingship that he declared the Father and the Son inseparable. But if, according to your word, O blasphemers, the Son, on the one hand, is a creature, and the Father, on the other hand, uncreated and unmade, he who in truth is new and he who is before the ages are no longer of one and the same glory and inseparable. But, on the one hand, the Father will have an essential and natural glory, the Son on the other hand will see it granted as by participation and reception, as a share of grace, and not according to essence and nature; on the other hand, he will also make the Father a liar who says through the prophet: I will not give my glory to another<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">[Lacuna of one folio recto and verso]</p>

        <p class="paragraph">10 ... from us. Let us learn to honor the martyrs by attitudes that approach theirs. For if it were a matter of effeminate and delicate men, struggling only on the stage and in dancing, for whom we celebrate ceremonies, we would have to please them by the softness and lightness of clothing and by a dissolute attitude, because it is in this that they themselves, during their lifetime, found their pleasure and joy. But if we celebrate the memory of God’s martyrs, reviving anew in our spirits their perfection, let us apply ourselves to the divine things that were dear to the martyrs.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">11 And just as those honored the Word of God who, for us, became incarnate, became man without change and suffered for us in his flesh, by sufferings similar to his, so too, let us honor them by the works of perfection that resemble them. Thus the great Antony, whose memory we have joined to that of the martyr Saint Babylas, legislator, head and teacher of ascetic monasticism in that he laid the foundations of the solitary and eremitical life and to speak in general of the inaccessible life, honored the martyrs when he practiced actions related and similar to those of the martyrs; and that, not by standing before a judge, nor by having his ribs torn, nor by being delivered to beasts to face combat, nor by being thrown into a burning furnace or a boiling cauldron, but by subduing his body, by subjugating it to subject the flesh like a servant to the spirit, he who, at every hour, so to speak, stood before Christ, like Elijah the Tishbite who said: As the Lord lives, before whom I stand<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>; he who was torn by demons, as by executioners, who, when they transformed themselves under the appearance of wild beasts and in various apparitions of phantoms, remained fearless, without being at all disturbed; he who demonstrated that the flame of fornication and the cauldron of pleasures are colder than any ice and any snow, he who bound himself with the cord of virtues, as the martyr Babylas had bound himself with a chain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">12 We too, although late, draw from this a lesson. Let women cease to let themselves be attracted by the golden rings on their hands and feet and to make their fingers shine with precious stones, let them be ashamed of the chain of Babylas which is (a chain) of total perfection. Beware, O woman, of the voluntary bonds that in truth you would not bear if they were made of lead and iron: yet now you carry their weight with pleasure because you are seized in spirit by the sight of gold. Suppress a little something of your adornment, sell it and deliver Christ who is chained in prison and who perhaps to pay his debts is stretched on the rack.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">13 Then truly, then you will be regarded by all men... For when you are adorned with ornaments of gold and garments of silk, a few people look at you with pleasure, and it is only a small number; but it is by a great number that you will be accused, whether they hate luxury, or cannot even bear the sight of it. On the contrary, if you clothe Christ, when you deliver him from bonds by paying his debt in his place, or by feeding him when he is hungry, or by covering him when he is naked<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>, and if you choose the adornment of perfection instead of that of golden ornaments, it is toward you that you will turn the eyes of all spectators.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">14 Turning their attention from beautiful white colors made of corruptible matter, they will be in admiration of your spiritual beauty, for that (adorned woman) is only a soulless and insensitive surface, covered with lime, in my opinion. But what do I say? Will you rejoice (only) the eyes of men? It is the choirs of angels also that you will gladden; you will make joyful every non-hypocritical eye that sees you, and you will receive from it praises that will not be extinguished and will not come to an end. For those who practice perfection, the praises that come from men flow and stop at the entrance of their ears, no account is taken of them. But for the proud and haughty, who do not pay attention to future hopes, the things of this present world are the object of their cares, as John the theologian also says, when he writes: All that, he says, is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">15 It is therefore, from the chain of an apostle, of the martyr Babylas who is in every way praiseworthy, that we have gathered such a lesson. But, tell me, shall we thus pass over in silence the mother of the three little children who fought at the same time as their master, who were beheaded at the same time as him and who, without discussion, transmitted by the effusion of their blood the great doctrines of piety; if no one omits to speak of her, let us not fail to have a thought of veneration for the zeal of these children for virtue.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">16 For while they were three in number, this number did not make her hesitate in her spirit, nor did she envisage a solution that (would be) outside of salvation and transitory; but she exhorted them to martyrdom and sent them to the future life, without thinking to set aside one (of them) so that he might be her staff of old age and give her the necessary nourishment. On the contrary, after having counted this life as a death, she thought that her son who remained would be dead; and like a mother full of mercy and love for her children, she took care that the three live the true and incorruptible life.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">17 Now the mothers of today, and I will add even very justly the fathers also, have so miserably aged and are so attached to this world, without making absolutely any account of the world to come, that if by chance they see one of their children run to the church, be very eager there, stay there and converse with chaste men, they say in vituperation that harm has been done to him and they become enraged against those who brought him to this perfection, calling them corrupters of children, harmful people and other qualifiers of this kind.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">18 And if the child himself courageously disposes himself to the monastic life and chooses for himself to lead the ascetic life, then, they engage in actions that cannot even be reported and which are in fact unbearable: they tear out their hair, scratch their cheeks, tear their tunics, sit on sackcloth and in ashes, cover themselves with black garments, weep and lament over the child as over a dead person, having their servants and maids accompany them in their mourning; moreover, some also place before them a bed or some object belonging to the child, weep over it almost as if he had died abroad and also summon women who compose lamentations and are drunk with sorrow. Is this then, tell me, the act of Christians? Of people who await the resurrection? Is this the act of those who have received the order not to weep over the dead and not to be overly grieved, like the pagans who have no hope<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">19 And why mention these things while setting aside what is more important and more grave? For, as they generally have their children at home, if one of them finds himself even slightly disposed to the ascetic life, they find in their mind thousands of pretexts to spend money, choosing teachers and instructors of all sorts of sciences and professions. While at great expense they buy them an office and direct them toward the profession of lawyers, they do not offer for this a single obol to those in need. But if they see one of their children after such preparation in too modest a situation, or even only a little lacking in malice, they call him useless, treat him as lazy, name him a good-for-nothing; and when, by such qualifiers, they have reproached him for his honest conduct, they try to lead him to evil, following the example of those who divert watercourses from one place to another.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">20 He, on the contrary, who in his behavior of mind is more devoid of scruples, disposed to shady profits, shameless of face, impure of language as of thought, ready for contention, they temper him like a sword and sharpen him, they make him burn with avarice, find occasions to incite him to heap up profits, under the goad of insatiability, often boasting in their conversations of their considerable fortune...</p>
