    <h1>Homily 8: Children of Bethlehem</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">Translation of the VHF of the Cathedral Homilies, on the children who were massacred by Herod in Bethlehem, by Saint Mar Severus, patriarch of Antioch.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">1. You are completely stunned by the senseless order of Herod against the innocent little children, since they were still at the breast in swaddling clothes, (an order) which brought an execrable death sentence. Do not be stunned, however, for (this order) stemmed from madness. That is why the divine and sacred book of the Gospels, showing the lack of reason of the one who had ordered it, says: He became angry, and it adds: Greatly<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. It is anger, it says, that pronounced the sentence, and (it is) anger that seized his thought. What could anger therefore give birth to, if not madness, the shedding of blood, and the fury of wild beasts?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">2. But, at these words, someone might perhaps say: "That is a good (answer) certainly, that after having been questioned about the motive and cause of the massacre of the children by Herod, you gave madness (proceeding) from anger. But I seek why Christ permitted innocent children to be massacred wholesale and that this be the result of the madness of this man, or rather an iniquitous deed. Indeed, on one hand, when Herod was seeking Christ, it is very evident that he could not find him who is absolutely ungraspable and difficult to find and who voluntarily for our salvation was seized and crucified when it was necessary and when he willed it. On the other hand, rather than a search for (Christ), this massacre of the children was the outcome of a design of vengeance<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">3. But it is the mark of a short-sighted spirit attached to this world to be troubled by the massacre of the children, as if it were perpetrated unjustly towards them. Indeed, if, while imprisoned, you were locked in a house without light, pressed by a long and prolonged hunger, or perhaps even your back torn by blows, if someone then promised to make you simply pass through death into a lit place, illumined by a light without decline, (with) a nourishment not subject to corruption, but incorruptible and powerful, satisfying, (in a place) rich in spiritual plants, in crowns flowering and developing at all hours, and never withering, is it not with eagerness that you would bend your neck under the sword, in order to go to that place, and that you would call benefactor, and not murderer, the one who would have struck you?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">4. Now, how does it differ from a dark house, this world into which, after the radiant life of paradise, we descended as a result of sin, where we are in truth entangled and embarrassed in thorns, namely in the bonds of temporal cares<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>, where, as if overwhelmed by blows, we eat our bread by the sweat of our brow<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, in order to acquire virtue through such painful discipline?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">5. In what, therefore, were they harmed, these children who, while Herod, because of the infamous massacre (he had ordered), underwent a punishment and underwent it more harshly, were themselves, in return, at one stroke, snatched from a miserable life, and passed at a bound to a happy and eternal end? If, therefore, this condition which is ours stopped at this present (world), it would be the moment for us to say like Paul: If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied; but if Christ is raised from the dead, he is the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>; and the rewards of virtue, like the punishments of iniquity, — according as it will be fitting for each — will be measured with the more equitable measures and weights of the future world; in this case, the children were not treated unjustly by Christ, on the contrary they were even favored, in being delivered to the massacre of Herod and in weaving the crowns of martyrdom; (crowns), which were not merited, except after much sweat, by Peter, the chief of the apostles, when he was crucified head down<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>, Paul and James, when they were struck down by the sword<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> and Stephen, the first martyr, when he was stoned with blows of stones<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">6. For my part, it happens that I am in admiration before the gifts, so worthy of God, of the coming of Christ in the flesh, because he shows also, by the immolation of these children, that, this human race descended to an imperfect and childish age, he rectifies it and makes it rise back to the perfection of the beginnings. Indeed, at the beginning, he formed Adam as a perfect being who was not brought to growth by successive ages; for immediately, he directly entrusted to him the cultivation of paradise, after having fixed for him as wages the grace of immortality. But, because (Adam) descended to death and, by the deception (of the serpent), fell, was put out of paradise and cast perfection far from him, the manner for us to come into existence through the commerce of marriage, was then introduced. Then, from the fact that man is born a small child, he shows by this inferiority the lack of perfection that he has in the beginnings; then, by the successive growth and progress of the ages, he shows that we are destined to corruption.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">7. However, the Emmanuel, the author and the physician of our nature, on one hand appropriated this imperfection which is ours, having made himself without change a small child because of his charity; on the other hand, to the small children and to our race, he gives the gift of the perfection which existed at the beginning, or rather of that which is his and which is completely divine, for he summons them to the combats of valiant and worthy martyrdom. That is why he also cries out in the Gospels, making it known that he came for this: <i>Be perfect, therefore</i>, he says, <i>as your heavenly Father is perfect</i><sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">8. How far will the folly of Nestorius go, who says with impudence concerning God who became incarnate: "I am ashamed to call God a small child of two or three months"<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">9. Indeed if (God) himself was ashamed to call himself a small child, he would blush first, — and with good reason — for having made himself man without change because of us. But if, on one hand, he takes upon himself, for the sake of the economy, the imperfection of the small child, and on the other hand he makes the small children participate in the perfection which is his and gives them the perfection of the martyrs, when they bear witness for him, as God, — for their blood cries with a voice stronger than the blood of Abel<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> —, how do you, because of this childish age, dishonor him who, even at that age, does wondrously what is worthy of God, and (how) do you cut this Unique One into two natures, and say to him blaspheming that he is a small child and that he is the Lord of the small child, when you grant to these two natures an adherence of affinity and present one as Lord and the other as the one over whom this Lord has authority<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">10. For if you knew the Emmanuel, one from two, without division, that is to say from divinity and from humanity, you would not say, O vain one, that he himself has authority over himself: indeed, on one hand, he has authority over all; on the other hand, he himself is not divided against himself; but the same is Lord, even when he came to accomplish the economy for us, and that is why he took upon himself the form of a servant and gave his life as a ransom for many<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">11. Likewise also, in the flight into Egypt, concerning which you divide him again into two, because you are ashamed of his voluntary humiliation, what is fitting for God is mixed: indeed, he makes the idols of Egypt tremble<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>, he puts the demons to flight, and, that region, which he had entrusted to Pharaoh fighting with God and blaspheming, by transforming it, he makes it pass to the sublime knowledge of God and to the orthodox faith which reigns there still now<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">12. To this, what does the impious Eutyches answer us, he who drank the troubled water of the impious Valentinus, the Manichaeans and Apollinaris? For, if it is not a body consubstantial with us, except for sin, possessing an intellectual soul, that the very Word of God united to himself hypostatically, the departure for Egypt was indeed superfluous. For it would have been necessary that, as in the case of hallucinations, he be invisible to deceive the sight of those who saw (him) and escape the hands of Herod, if in truth he appeared to us in imagination and conferred upon himself a celestial or aerial body, and not that which is consubstantial with us. But this impure and atheistic opinion was chased away and cast far off by the angel who stood by Joseph during his sleep, saying at one moment: <i>Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt</i><sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>, and at another moment: <i>Get up, take the child, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the child’s life are dead</i><sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">13. To him, you also, for such a benefit, render this thanksgiving, in his honor, and in honor of the little children who bore witness in Bethlehem. According to the warning of Paul, do not be children in your thoughts, but as regards malice be infants, and in your thoughts be perfect men<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>, in order to receive through Christ what is perfect on the coming day, terrible and glorious, of his appearing. To him be praise, to him who submitted for us to such a humiliation and so charitable, without change or imagination, now and always and unto the ages of ages! Amen!</p>
