    <h1>Homily 2: Annunciation</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">
            Perhaps you imagine that I am filled with joy and overflowing with happiness because you rejoice at my poor words and hasten with such eagerness to come and hear me. In reality, I weep and I groan, and I make your joy the nourishment of my sorrow. I think, indeed, that if you were not constrained by a lack of nourishment and by hunger, and if you were not nourished by an orthodox and sound teaching, you would not have such an avidity for these vile and contemptible discourses, in the manner of those who, for want of wheat, desire to share barley bread.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Such was precisely that hunger which the prophet Amos foretold in advance, saying: "Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will send a famine on the earth, not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Isaiah also threatened Jerusalem with this famine, as a form of curse, saying: "From her shall be taken the prophet, the wonderful counselor, and the wise architect."<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> These names openly designate the teachers of divine words. Likewise, the apostle Paul, writing to the Corinthians, said: "According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise architect I have laid the foundation."<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> The prophet, adding to this threatening curse, says: "The intelligent hearer shall also be taken from Jerusalem."<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            But give thanks to God who, in his charity, tempers these sad threats. He spoke of "my Jerusalem"<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>, but I say of this exegesis: He has not taken away the intelligent hearer. For it is with intelligence, by grace from on high, that you listen to the apostolic teachings; and you recognize the voice of the true shepherd, and you rebel and bristle against a foreign voice<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>, and you no longer let yourselves be led astray from the royal way.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            That is why I believe that to me also a word has been given which, faced with your intelligent audience, is either worthless or of a light and modest value.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">
            For behold, some have now arrived at such an impiety that, to the praise of the Trisagion by which we celebrate the Savior Christ, saying: "Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal," they do not add: "Who was crucified for us, have mercy on us." They think it is an infamy to proclaim immortal him who in the flesh was crucified for us, and they have not learned to say with Saint Paul: "May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> The cross is therefore a true glorification and an invincible armor, when we proclaim this of the incarnate God.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            And so it is with harmonious sounds in your souls, in the manner of a spiritual cithara, and touched by the Holy Spirit, that you rightfully raise up each day this praise to the living Christ God. And you have suffered bitterly until now in the face of those who divided him, after the inexplicable union, into the duality of natures.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            For if he who became incarnate and was thus crucified for us is immortal, then he is one person, one hypostasis and the incarnate nature of God the Word<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>. If, on the contrary, after the union, he is acknowledged in two natures, as proclaimed by the assembly—that of vanity—of those who gathered at Chalcedon, then on the one hand the union is destroyed, being divided into duality; on the other hand the mystery is divided: to the divine nature we attribute immortality as proper, and to the human nature, death only<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">
            But you are not the only ones to be afflicted by this: the angelic powers also groaned and suffered with you when they saw that by blasphemies the connection between earthly and heavenly things was broken, and they said among themselves: When we exulted concerning the birth of the Emmanuel, we formed ourselves into legions, and, marveling at the highest degree of the inexpressible charity of God, we responded with praise, and, seeing that the unceasing combat was abolished, we made resound on earth the first song of reconciliation: "Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, and good will to men!"<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Where then are these words of peace, if we in heaven acknowledge as Word of God one Son, even when he became incarnate, and we make not the slightest addition to the hymn of the Trisagion, but three times we proclaim that he is holy<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>, when we celebrate the one Lord Sabaoth and acknowledge one lordship of the divinity in three hypostases? While men on earth, forgetting the gift of all this and the splendor of reality, divide the one Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, he who is inseparable and indivisible, when they say that after the union he is acknowledged in two natures and they introduce an additional number, to the point of thus glorifying the man who subsists by himself and thereby completing the Trinity into a quaternity, and of speaking like the impious Nestorius: "Let us preserve in this way the connection of natures without confusion, let us acknowledge God who is in the man, let us honor the man who by the divine connection is adored together with the almighty God"<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>, so that, in another passage, he dares to call a connection of this sort a union, saying: "Not that we mix, but that we unite—I affirm—the natures."<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">
            But when he ascended from the tomb, or rather from the lower parts of the earth<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>, to heaven, we acknowledged that he was the Lord and the king of glory, while we are perplexed when we heard other powers say: "Lift up your heads, O gates! and be lifted up, O ancient doors! that the King of glory may come in."<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> And we asked ourselves: "Who is this King of glory?"<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> But when we learned that he was the Lord, strong and mighty in the battle<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> which he waged against the Slanderer, and that, by the cross, he had vanquished the assailant and enemy of all men, and had delivered from long captivity and tyranny those who had been subjected under his hand, then joyfully we opened the eternal doors, and we received him, not as a new and created God, but as the God before the ages, the Lord and king of the heavenly powers, and we acknowledged through all this abundance of charity, goodness<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>, and economy towards the Church, the varied and manifold wisdom<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> of the God who alone is wise and works wonders<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            This is what those blessed and angelic powers thought and said<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>, who could not bear the blasphemy of men. For if, for one sinner who repents, there is joy in heaven<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>, according to the unfailing word of the Lord in the Gospel, how much, do you think, are these intellectual and immaterial spirits grieved and filled with loving mercy for the creature who is their close kin and endowed with reason—for man—because of the total perdition of souls, precisely of those who, while blaspheming, believed they were in pious sentiments!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">
            How much more must Michael, one of the chief princes<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>, who had been in such grief because of the duration of Israel's captivity in Babylon, as was revealed to the divine and admirable prophet Daniel, have been still more afflicted when he saw the holy people, the chosen race<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>, those who had been redeemed by the blood of Christ<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>, the Son of God, and who because of that have been called Christians, falling into anthropolatry and despising piety!
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Gabriel, on the other hand, his companion of the same rank and order, was also associated with him in affliction, in pity for us and in mercy, all the more so as he saw that the message he announced to the holy Mother of God and Virgin Mary was misunderstood. For he first said: "Rejoice, O full of grace, the Lord is with you."<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup> By these words he made known that God the Word, who is without beginning<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup> and eternal, in an ineffable manner, without change and without confusion, dwells in the virginal womb and becomes incarnate there. For in that brief instant and in that indivisible space of time, the word of the archangel was uttered and the Word of God was found in the womb of Mary. Thus it was made understood that the salutation effected an extraordinary action and was not a simple greeting<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            But as the blessed Virgin was troubled and wondered what sort of greeting this might be<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>, Gabriel, who had been charged with this divine ministry which was neither to constrain her nor to make her hesitate by any doubt or by a vain thought from an allegorical or deceptive reasoning, like the inventions and imaginations of poets, immediately gave the explanation, adding: "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus."<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">
            "But do not be troubled," he said, "because I have announced to you the coming of God; nor think that it concerns for you a childbirth that will be accomplished by itself or spontaneously, nor that he will burst into your womb like the passage of lightning, as in foolish or imaginary nonsense. For the conception will indeed take place in accordance with the order of nature, but the gestation and childbirth will occur without human seed. For the Word of God comes to restore human nature and its generation, and for the beginnings of a stage towards what will be accomplished."
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            That is why Gabriel said: "Behold, you will conceive in your womb"<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>, so that the Lord took, from the virginal womb and from our substance, flesh and the human creature, and blessed the first germination of our generation. For if he had not come through all these phases—sin excepted<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>—in the same manner as we, human seed being excepted, if he had not taken flesh in the womb, if he had not been formed during a period of nine months, and if he had not been born, he would not have abolished the condemnation pronounced against Eve: "You shall bear children in pain."<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            That is why Gabriel said: "And you shall call his name Jesus."<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup> For he who came for the salvation of our race is rightly called Jesus. The name Jesus is "salvation of God and healing" when translated into the Greek language; for indeed in Hebrew it indicates the almighty God<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            And lest Mary might say to him, for example: "But already to certain men has been given the name Jesus," Gabriel added, elevating her spirit: "He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High."<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> As if to say: it is not as any one of the many men that you shall call him Jesus, but as he who is truly great. For great is our Lord, and great is his power<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>, as David sings of him who is by nature the Son of the Father Most High.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">
            As for the words: "He will be and will be called," they are adapted to the economy according to the flesh, and to the measure of poverty by which he voluntarily made himself poor for us, though he was rich, so that we might become rich through his poverty<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>, he who was by nature and eternally called great, I say, and Son of God Most High.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            This one, while he became man for us in an unchanged manner, is also said "to be" and "to be called," so that we in him, as by a second beginning of our race, might be called gods and sons of God: "I said," he said through the prophet David, "you are gods, you are all sons of the Most High."<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            And Gabriel added still after this: "And the Lord God will give to him the throne of David his father."<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup> This was said by Gabriel for no other purpose than to remind the Virgin of the prophets and to teach her clearly that he who was to be born of her was the Messiah spoken of by them in prophecy: he will come from the seed of David<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup>.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Raising still higher the spirit of the holy Virgin and not letting her fall back into human thoughts riveted to the earth, nor believe that his reign would be temporal like that of one of the sons of David who reigned previously over Israel, Gabriel added further to what had already been said earlier: "He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end."<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup> And it is not possible for anyone to reign forever with a kingdom that will have no end, except God alone, creator and master of all, so that, even if it is said, according to the economy, in a human manner, that he will occupy the throne of David, nonetheless he is the same, divinely, king and eternal, and he has no end.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">
            Rightly, therefore, and in a manner perfectly suited to God, Gabriel said: "He will reign over the house of Jacob," for he called the Church the house of Jacob, and he recalled the ancient history, as well as the symbol which prefigured the reality. For when Isaac and Jacob were in the womb of Rebecca, God said to her: "Behold, two nations are in your womb, and two peoples, born of you, shall be divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the elder shall serve the younger."<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup> And when her days to give birth were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb. The first came forth red, all his body like a hairy mantle; so they called his name Esau. Afterward his brother came forth, and his hand had taken hold of Esau's heel; so his name was called Jacob.<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Thus these two children bore the symbol of two peoples according to the word of the Lord: Esau prefigured the people of the Synagogue, because he was the first-born and the first to acknowledge God. That is why indeed he was red, well-made, handsome and resplendent, and he was joyful because of his vocation and profession of faith; but he was rustic and hairy, and he was blinded by his hair and rendered consequently incapable of looking towards God with purity and perfection. Also because of the malice of Egypt with which he had lived, for that reason there was much that was dead in him: for hair is considered a part of the body, but it is for the most part dead and insensible and causes no pain when cut.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Jacob, for his part, prefigured in himself the people of the Church and those from the nations, in that he was chronologically second and had acknowledged God after the Synagogue. Moreover, he held and seized the heel of Esau<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup>, for, while the Church came after the Law and the prophets and followed them, she acknowledged as Lord the Messiah whom the Synagogue could not acknowledge, her hair having blinded her face. That is also why the Synagogue was subjected to the Church, while the latter was smaller and later in time: whether you speak of bodily slavery, for she was under the power of the Romans—but it was known in advance that the power of the Roman empire would pass to Christ<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup>—or whether you consider an intellectual and spiritual slavery, for the Synagogue through the Law and the prophets served and favored the revelation of the gospel.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">
            Jacob, moreover, was a simple man—"without blemish" as Symmachus translates<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup>—and in this he prefigured the truth. For the Church, of which Jacob was the figure, is holy and without blemish, and there is in her no spot or wrinkle or anything of the sort<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup>, as the wise Paul said.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            But furthermore, Esau sold his birthright to Jacob when he received as its price bread and a pottage of lentils<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup>, a consolation for gluttony. Thus, in like manner, the people of the Synagogue ate, were filled, grew fat, thick, and heavy; and they kicked and strayed from God their Savior<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup>. And God, following this, granted and gave to the Church his primacy and the resulting birthright, which he had moreover proclaimed in advance through the mouth of the prophet Malachi, saying: "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            That he who was to be born of the Mother of God, Mary, announced by Gabriel, would reign forever over the Church, was also known, for he did not say: "He will reign over Jacob forever," but "over his house"<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup>. The house of God of which Jacob was the figure is the Church, according to what Paul says writing to Timothy: "So that you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God."<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup> You see what an ocean of divine thoughts the announcement of the archangel Gabriel contains in few words.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            This announcement also opened paradise, which had been closed since Adam, for five thousand years and more. For if the thief had not been in the wake of the strong words of the archangel and had not believed that the kingdom of Christ would have no end, he would not have said, upon seeing him who was crucified, as if expecting never to die: "Remember me when you come into your kingdom."<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">
            And immediately he heard: "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise."<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup> And how could the thief have been the object of a promise worthy of God, if he who was crucified had not been immortal, and if he had not been a king without beginning or end, he who had voluntarily borne for us the cross in his flesh and tasted the death that gives life?
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            But as the holy Virgin considered the object of this announcement worthy of God, she did not let herself believe immediately; she even hesitated concerning the mode of the birth and, considering the order of nature, said: "How will this be, since I do not know a man?"<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Then the angel answered her: "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God."<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            What are you saying? he said. "I do not know a man." Do not consider the order of nature and do not seek the literal sense of this marvel. The Holy Spirit will come upon you; have you heard? The Holy One. Chase from your mind all imagination of sexual relation or covetousness, and believe that the coming of the Spirit is exempt from all defilement and impurity. For the conception will indeed take place really, although you alone will engage it from your own substance, whereas that of all other mothers cannot engage it except together with the father.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">
            He who is conceived is he of whom I spoke above at the beginning of the announcement: "Hail, O full of grace, the Lord is with you."<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup> This Lord is the Word of God, one of the three hypostases, the power of the Father, the Most High, who will overshadow you. For Christ is the power and the wisdom of God<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup>, who, on the one hand, has no beginning and is eternally begotten, not corporeally, as Word of the Father. From you, on the other hand, he becomes incarnate without change, in an inexplicable manner and without confusion. But he is consubstantial with you, this body which is to be conceived and born, which is animated by a rational and intellectual soul, and which wills to accomplish the salvation of the whole human race and not of a part only.
        </p>

            That is why "the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God."<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup> One must observe how Gabriel acknowledges as one the Emmanuel who is to be born according to the flesh from the Mother of God and Ever-Virgin Mary. But he will be called holy, not as a foreigner, about to appropriate to himself the Son of God and preparing to be sanctified by this participation; but as he who is holy by nature, by the fact that the same is Son of God and is one from two, namely from divinity and humanity. For if he had said to acknowledge him in two natures, like those impious and new scrutineers, he would have said: "Therefore the child to be born will be called holy, for in him is the Son of God."<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup>
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">
            From this we must further ask the reason why he calls him thus: "Therefore the child to be born will be called holy"—and then he removes the punctuation and adds: "the Son of God"<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup>, so as not to give occasion to the impious Nestorius and his masters who say: "The Son of God is associated with him who is born of Mary by appellation, by the name, and by the power of sonship."<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            For Diodore wrote thus, drunk in the manner of the Jews: "When the Lord was in the womb of the Virgin and from her substance, he did not have the honor of sonship, but when on the contrary he was formed and became the temple of God the Word and the Only Son, then he assumed the honor of the name and was also associated with him in honor."<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Theodore, who is even more impious than Diodore—for such is the pair of masters of Nestorius—said: "It is by grace that he is Son, the man who is from Mary, but by nature it is God the Word."<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            But the announcement of the archangel Gabriel confounds the impious and criminal blasphemers, saying that it is completely and without omission and therefore not wrongly that he is called as he announces, and as charged with a mystery surpassing speech, he says: "Therefore the child to be born will be called," and likewise he added afterwards: "the Son of God."<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup> Because, he says, I have said: "He will be called holy," do not think that he is sanctified as a man by grace from his mother's womb, like Jeremiah<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup> or John the Baptist<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup>, but as the Son of God who possesses a natural and substantial holiness.

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">
            For this fact also, that he whom we glorify deigned to come to all this humiliation, in order to render us, who were mired in sin, elevated and celestial, let us glorify him, not with tongue only, nor even by hymns and songs<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup> which move the soul and are at most capable of producing a desire or a pious thought, but also by the brilliance of actions, as the wise Paul said, exhorting to abstain from immorality: "Glorify God in your body."<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            When you glorify in words, you do so with one mouth and one tongue, but when you apply yourself to doing actions worthy of Christianity, then you raise praise by thousands of mouths. For each one among those who see you will glorify God who became incarnate for us, because he will have been taught and instructed by our conduct of such wondrous commandments.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            And if someone sees you practicing holiness, he will necessarily say: "Glory to God, who from the Virgin was born in the flesh and instituted holiness as a law for men." If, on the other hand, he sees that you are full of restraint and that you trample on pride and vanity, he will look up to heaven and glorify him who lowered heaven<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup>, as it is written, and humbled himself voluntarily<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup> and named for us the new way that makes us ascend to heaven, namely humility.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            If again he realizes that you despise riches and share your goods with those in need, he will run in thought towards the promise of the life to come and will praise the sun of justice<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup> who is Christ, who by the rays of the resurrection has illuminated the earth and taught to despise transient goods and to acquire instead durable and incorruptible goods<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup>, those that eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup>, as the divine book says.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">
            But if we grow weary of these goods and let ourselves go to covetousness and become chained to matter, then Christianity will be turned into derision, the hopes of the resurrection will appear vain, the great mystery of piety<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup> will seem a joke to unbelievers, and the name of God will be blasphemed because of us among the nations, according to the word of the prophet<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup>. May this not happen, by the grace and charity of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, to whom be praise, with the Father and with his holy and consubstantial Spirit, unto the ages of ages. Amen!
