    <h1>Homily 7: Nativity & St Stephen</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">By Saint Severus the Patriarch, on the Nativity, that is, the Manifestation. It is then spoken of the commemoration of Mar Stephen: therefore the end of the homily also treats of the martyr.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">1. At the sight of your illustrious assembly, I rejoice and exult within myself. But I truly do not know if anyone among you — permit me to express myself by resorting to your indulgence — has received a spirit that is worthy of the present solemnity. For what spirit is vast enough and free enough from the clouds of passions, to be capable, through contemplation, to approach as is fitting these inaccessible subjects, to have a sufficient desire for them, and to be susceptible, even if he has this desire, to be enlightened only by the wonder of this day that dawns, and to receive even a single ray of the Nativity of Christ according to the flesh?<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">2. Indeed, from the point of view of the entire economy, it is not even possible for the angels — still less for us who are mired in mud — to consider that, in honor of him who is timeless, without beginning and uncreated, we celebrate the feast of the Nativity, and — a thing even more surprising — that the same feast is called the Apparition of God: to the point that I dare to ask the reason why he who does not become, has become. For, while he is the Word, he became flesh, without changing from what he was, the Word, and he assumed in addition this fact of having become man.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">3. Let us learn from these two names why he humbled himself to the nativity according to the flesh: it is so that God may appear to men, as the divine prophet David had predicted somewhere, saying: <i>God will come visibly, our God, and he will not keep silent</i>.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> These words: <i>God will come visibly</i> clearly show that he who cannot be seen — for <i>God, no one has ever seen</i>,<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> according to the word of John — became visible to corporeal eyes. And these words: <i>He will not keep silent</i> indicate that human nature and our race were acting evilly and had come to fall into deep abysses of malice, and that there was no longer even a kind of impious action that did not make it bow its head, to the point of inclining.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">4. But the Word was worthy of being heard and reduced to silence, that the dispensation of Providence might be manifested, because the Law, having become silent, disappeared. But the Word, dominating by its own power, did not turn away from us, did not consider the distance of the estrangement, because the human race was sick.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">5. Now it is fitting that he who descended to us not be thought to have moved from one place to another — for how could he who is present everywhere, who fills the universe and is contained by nothing, move? — but that he who is entirely in God and in the Father, being God, consented to be seized by the Virgin, and he consented equally to be seized, whereas by his power he remained unseizable.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">6. Concerning this mystery, it is not necessary to explain it to those who have received the faith and in their hearts the grace of God; but to those who are slow in understanding or worthy of derision. For he who in the beginning was with the Father, and the life and the light of men, the Word was God,<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> likewise said, and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> But if until now I have refrained from covering these passages, and have not begun to explain the manner, it is because he who is proclaimed by words and who is beyond words, he who speaks in deeds and who is revealed by the power of signs. And what does he say? <i>We have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth</i>;<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> and as the Gospel says: <i>The Word became flesh and dwelt among us</i>,<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> which is the sign and the proof that, for us, with our eyes we have seen and we have seen the wonderful glory befitting God and that he has given us the gift of salvation.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">7. For he who transformed the elements by his will alone and who gave to the man blind from birth the principle of seeing light, he showed himself to be like the maker of the universe, the high and true God, becoming man without change through his flesh, and not the contrary, according to the nonsense of Nestorius, namely that, being a man and having grown, he would have been changed later into divinity, in the manner of idols that the Greeks worship.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
     
        <p class="paragraph">8. For the evangelist exclaims: <i>We have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth</i>.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> Now the only Son, it is in the essence and nature of the Father that he has glory in himself, and not as one of the just men, by participation and as by a portion of grace and gift, that he enriched himself with an acquirable reality. Now, it is because glory befitted God that he was full of grace and truth. For it belonged to God alone to grant such grace, to not remember our malice for us and to save us, who had sinned and become ungrateful.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">9. Indeed, it is by grace that we are saved through faith; and this, it is not from us, but it is the gift of God. It is not by works, so that no one may boast,<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> as Paul says. How is it not an immense gift, surpassing the most superabundant favors, that he grants us: this fact of coming into existence and having brought us out of the state of nothingness by mixing the divine image with the mud, I mean a soul endowed with intelligence. Then, because of malice, we descended into corruption, and were condemned to death. But how did he make our defeat the cause of a success — a thing much more remarkable! For he not only made us return and rise again to existence, but, by a total superabundance, he gave us to be even better.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">10. The image having been covered by mud and filth, by uniting the creature that we are to his own divinity, he came to the aid of this image and made the flesh ascend with him to heaven, so that what is best in us regains power, as well as what, because of him, had been bound with him from the beginning: he thus brought to perfection this superior living being endowed with reason, man; what he had wisely fashioned at the beginning, he took up again with more wisdom: at the beginning indeed, it is with earth that he fashioned Adam and breathed into him a breath of life,<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> giving him a rational soul, making him capable of perfection and all wisdom: such is the property of what is in the image of God. But, after the fall from Paradise and the loss of immortal life, Adam knew his wife and then was introduced this carnal commerce and this mixture of emission which befits animals more than men endowed with reason and which leads to corruption and death, but which ensures the descent of the race.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">11. Proceeding then with so much wisdom and love for men, what does the Emmanuel do? He remade two natures in one being: I mean the creature that was honored with the grace of immortality (the soul) and that which was bound to corruption (the body), in this birth resulting from the union. He who at the beginning had fashioned man from the earth, was fashioned a small child from the Virgin, taking flesh from the Holy Spirit, and from her. This flesh is consubstantial with ours which is animated by a rational soul. And this was not done through sleep, desire, and the emission of human seed.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">12. The property of our first creation was a coming into the flesh without seed; but the property of this second way of coming into existence for us, is to come totally from the woman. Likewise the conception took place according to ordinary time, for the days for her to give birth were fulfilled;<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> the sacred book concerning the Mother of God says on the one hand that it is the work of a husband; but on the other hand that it is without the experience of a carnal union that it began, and that it was accomplished in virginity, for, after the birth, the seal of virginity remained inviolate. For in all that brought us corruption, he mixed seeds of immortality: the whole logic of the economy aimed at this, that, on the one hand, he might seize corruption, stop it and make it turn back, and on the other hand that he might make it disappear through immortality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        
        <p class="paragraph">13. But it is time for me to say and cry out these words of David: <i>Who can recount the powers of the Lord, make all his praises heard?</i><sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> For this birth worthy of God and above all wonder, it surpasses every limit, to the point that after this it will be said that this vision and this encounter cannot be expressed in words and are inaccessible to thought.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">14. Isaiah, that trumpet of prophecy with a powerful voice, proclaimed it in advance, so to speak, when, as a master, he closes the mouth of those who dispute and rise up against the greatness of the wonder, speaking thus: <i>A voice of clamor from the city, a voice from the temple: it is the voice of the Lord, who pays their reward to those who rise up against him. Before she who is in labor gives birth and before the pains of childbirth come, she has fled and has given birth to a male child</i>.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> May what I must prophesy be heard, he says: this clamor resembles that of a city which moderates its voice greatly for the ears of those who listen. But, although it can be heard, it is nevertheless ineffable, for it is the voice coming from the temple. Now what is brought or revealed from the temple, from its interior and from the holy of holies, as the divine book says, is in some way mysterious, inaccessible or difficult to access for the minds of men and impossible to explain; unless a voice and a powerful and unspeakable preaching stand up to rise against those who are disposed to contestation and disobedience and give them their reward.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">15. But what is this voice and this preaching thus designated? <i>Before she who is in labor gives birth, and before the pains of childbirth come, she has fled and has borne a male child</i>.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> I see, he says, the womb which is about to give birth and which hastens to bring forth, and I therefore call mother she who has known. But, I know not how, while she anticipated the pains of childbirth, she escaped the ordinary limits of nature for the bringing forth of a male child. And the seal of virginity, even after birth, remains inviolate.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">16. That is why the prophet, taken with admiration in his spirit on the occasion of this wonder, adds again these words, exclaiming: <i>Who has heard anything like this and who has seen such a thing?</i><sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> One will ask, and very justly, how, because she gave birth to a male child, the prophet can be in admiration for something astonishing. Indeed there is nothing unusual nor foreign to nature there, for many other women have borne male children, and even now one can see women giving birth to male children.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">17. But one must know that even this is not without arousing astonishment, and that this word was not said in passing, but with much relevance. Indeed, since our nature has been effeminated and has lost its vigor and that death, following the transgression of the commandment imposed on Adam, has reigned over all men, there was no longer any male to be brought into the world, capable of resisting with vigor to sin to the point of extirpating it at its root; and thus properly speaking there were only females and effeminates to be brought into the world. Only since then the Emmanuel has been truly born a male child, when he overturned the tyranny of the Slanderer: indeed he raised mortal man to virility as well as our nature which was paralyzed and weakened, so that men may be comforted in the combats for religion and take boldness against him who has oppressed them from the beginning. That is why, may even the Jew be ashamed, may even the pagan blush, seeing the virginal birth preached by the prophets and attested by real events.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">18. But what shall I feel, seeing this discourse lengthen unduly, and that, while there is here only a ray of the coming of Christ in the flesh, as I have said. But I omit Bethlehem, the census, the swaddling clothes, the manger, the journey of the star, the gifts and the adoration of the Magi, the flight into Egypt, then the return from Egypt, the design of Herod soiled by murder, who took up arms against small children, to the point that a demented anger drove him to no longer know whom he wanted to kill. Each of the subjects that I enumerate, indeed, would call for an explanation and brings proof that there are divine thoughts there. While I would like to say everything, I will, in order not to be long-winded, omit everything, because I love these subjects too much, giving also in this an occasion of victory to him who has conquered the world.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">

        <p class="paragraph">19. As for you, since you yourselves have taken pleasure in these words, when you go home and set your table, take pleasure in these same words. Since thus by a pleasure of the spirit, you will have silenced the pleasure of the belly, all this feast day, which will truly have been subject to reason, set it apart therefore and consecrate it to God the Word who became incarnate for us.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">20. But one should add your entire life, as Stephen also did, the first martyr, when he shed his own blood and merited the crown of martyrdom. For this is also the work of the wisdom of God, deeper than all things, which, by its actions, announces what is invisible and hidden, namely that Stephen, that is, he who introduced the name of crown,<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> is the chief of the troop, in the first of the sacred combats; who also made known, by his name, as well as by the proof that he gave in his own person, to those who go to the same stadium to win this crown, that they will receive it in the kingdom of heaven whereas before the combats it had shone in advance.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">21. I omit to say that, on this point, namely to come to a resemblance very close to Christ, no one among the martyrs is capable of rivaling him. First, because the fact of having had the privilege of being the first to suffer for Christ has no equivalent for perfection. Secondly, by his excellent and divine discourse,<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> he leads the Jews not to remain fixed and blinded by what is written, but to understand in a spiritual way the law and the prophets; and to show in a luminous way that it is not a man among many others, as they thought, whom they crucified, but the Word who became flesh and became man for us, the God of the Law and the prophets.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">22. Then, being rapt in spirit by contemplation and having fixed his eyes on heaven,<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> he left the earth, and, while remaining on the earth, he saw him of whom he was the witness, attached to him and being entirely turned towards him, he denied that he was only a man, while he was being stoned under a hail of stones and he pronounced words worthy of God: those, indeed, whom he blamed, he treated as stiff-necked, uncircumcised of heart and ear,<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> and he prayed for them saying: <i>Lord, do not hold this sin against them</i>,<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> resembling in this to him who, addressing those who crucified him, at the height of the passion, cried out: <i>Father, forgive them</i>.<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, what should he do, he who saw Jesus, if not pronounce the words of Jesus? And just as painters who paint portraits with colors and look at the model image, then take care to reproduce nothing else on their tablets than the model that is there, likewise, it is according to the model Jesus that Stephen painted his personal image in a most remarkable way, as much as it was possible.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">23. That is why, rewarding him because of his so faithful and exact imitation, it is very near his feast that God caused the memory of the day and the feast of the Nativity to be made; that to us also, who are so far because of our sins — for our sins, as the prophet says, make a separation between us and him<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> — that this memory may obtain for us all to be very near to him, once purified by penance, since he can do all things, and for him nothing is impossible.<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup> To him be praise, glory, and power, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen!</p>
