    <h1>Homily 21: Catechesis for Holy Wednesday</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">Catechesis which was delivered, according to custom, on Wednesday of Holy Week, that is, of the Passion, to those who were going to be deemed worthy of holy baptism*.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">The term "catechesis" produces in me a great fear, and with very good reason. Indeed, I consider within myself not so much what must be said, as what must be kept silent; and I shall not trust new ears, which are not trained in hearing divine dogmas and which still need milk and not solid food<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, as the wise Paul says. This is why, indeed, this very kind of teaching is called "catechesis"<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, or resonance; for it accustoms the very ears of the listeners by a sounding, that is, by the sound of the trumpet that introduces the words, lest, approaching the thunder of theology without having been trained, and being still more shaken by this voice that expresses itself thus, without being able to bear its intensity, they should be troubled and overthrown.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">One can find this already transmitted in the sacred books. Indeed, when Moses was about to receive the divine Law from God — and through him the whole multitude of the people of Israel — on the one hand, he alone ascended the mountain, for he had received the order, on the other hand, he placed below at the foot of Mount Sinai the already purified people, as it is written, and which, as far as possible, he himself had previously purified<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>. And, before the words and revelations of the Law were proclaimed, trumpets made a powerful and terrifying sound resound, while the mountain itself was covered with a dark cloud and surrounded by lightning and inspired fear in those who saw and heard<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Such is the mountain of theology; on the one hand, it is accessible to those who like Moses are in perfection — and that when God calls them, for, when the divine call does not open the way and does not support, even for those who are in his case, it is completely incomprehensible —, on the other hand, for those who have been purified truly only in a mediocre way, as was the case then for the children of Israel who were purified only for a time, it is not only incomprehensible, but also inaccessible and unapproachable.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Nevertheless, it is not completely inaccessible, for they are permitted to stand nearby, to hear the trumpet that prepares for the hearing of the words that introduce the dogmas, and to receive somewhat obscurely the first words of the teaching, like flashes that coming from the cloud illuminate and run at the same time; and it is through ascents in perfection that they will approach, that they will reach it and be elevated at the same time by the hearing. The divine Book confirms that it is indeed so, saying: "There were sounds of trumpets that went out and became much stronger. Moses spoke and God answered him with a loud voice"<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">We must therefore first sound the trumpet, then force the power of the breath and thus interrogate God, speak to him and hear what comes from him, transmit and pass on the words to others. But because I am no longer sufficient to sound the trumpet, much less to speak to God, to be the minister of his words, I make use of the pastoral trumpet of the Fathers and doctors of the Church, like the son of an experienced shepherd, who is very far below the skill of his father and who has inherited the instruments of the trade: those lived for God when they departed from here below and now stand around us and look at us with the spiritual and incorporeal armies. And it is from these doctrines on which they labored that I will sound the trumpet and say what was said to them by God.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">They themselves, indeed, by attaching themselves to the Law, the Prophets, the Gospels, and the Apostles, have taught us to "believe in one God the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible." On the one hand, because they said: "One God," they rejected the error of the pagans and overthrew to the ground the numerous crowd of false gods, whom — I know not how — the fables current among them have introduced and, so to speak, made dwell in the heavens, saying with the prophet Jeremiah: "Let these gods who have made neither the heavens nor the earth disappear from the earth and from under these heavens"<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">On the other hand, because they professed the Father, they showed manifestly that he himself is the beginning and source of existence and the support of that which is; but not without the Son equal in eternity, who made this universe at the same time with him. Indeed, how would he have been called Father properly speaking, if there is no true and genuine Son having with him the same essence and (the same) nature, thanks to whom he is said to be Father also of all creatures, insofar as they have been created thanks to his beloved Son? For, of this one as begotten, he is Father by nature, and of those, as created, he is said to be Father by grace, granting them existence by creation.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">When therefore you believe in one God the Father, you who hear this preliminary teaching, or of the beginning of the entrance, profess moreover that he is also almighty, and renounce the evil principle of the Manichaeans, the origin of evil according to their reasoning, (principle) that these fools have also called Uncreated Darkness and said to be an autonomous essence — whereas it is without existence and without hypostasis — and (which) they have opposed as a tyrant to him who is the only principle and who holds all, I mean, to the true and spiritual and essential light; and it is from him as from a putrid source that they say evils flow.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But, if they posit as certain that (the evil principle) is uncreated and without beginning, they will in any case say that it is also infinite; for what is uncreated and without beginning has as its property to be infinite. What place therefore will be his, as well as that of the good principle, when he himself also is infinite as uncreated and fills all? Indeed, either each of them will be finite, and they will cease to be God, because in truth being finite is foreign to divinity; or, if they are infinite, it is not possible that they be so at the same time, while they are divided both in will and in essence; and indeed, there is no community between light and darkness<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>, according to the opinion of Paul and according to truth itself. But if we concede as by indulgence that they are both infinite and uncreated, it is necessary that we place between these (principles) a third, which is also uncreated, placed as in the middle of the extremes, separating the two (principles) one from the other and restraining them.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But those who forge these impure old wives' abominations — for these are not dogmas — say that the evil principle burned with desire for the good, (that) it ran like a lover toward its light, (that) it tore away a part of it and devoured it, and (that) "thus creatures are found to be, possessing a mixture of each of them." O inconsistent and foolish nonsense, full of irrationality and folly! How, indeed, would that which is evil by essence burn with desire for the good? For the (properties) of essences are fixed, I think, in some manner or other, and immutable; and this is certain also from the definitions of nature, because in truth the good God too, while he is good by essence, is fixed, firm and without mixture, and without inclination toward what (is) contrary.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And what then is this voracity, by which the evil devoured a part (taken) from the good? Is it that, like carnivorous beasts, it cut that with its teeth and thus devoured it, like the Kronos of the fable, who, as the story relates, devoured his children? And he himself, the good, is he subdued as weak and cut in half, when he is deprived of a part that was his and is no longer intact nor whole like those who (are) wounded in the foot or whose arm (is) cut off?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But it is precisely mainly because of this that (the good) will have bellicose dispositions toward the evil, this ravenous and voracious one, and who has devoured (his) prey like the whale. Therefore the good itself will be without action as weak; and the evil alone will prevail, and will create and precede this visible world. Henceforth we are subject to a single principle that has prevailed and carried the day; and the fabulous fiction of two principles is found (to be) something vain for the wicked themselves.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For his part, also, the evil principle, or evil itself, and the Uncreated Darkness cannot subsist in themselves, if they have within themselves a part (taken) from the good, which has been devoured, because it is going to be a subject of trouble. Indeed, it is not because in truth it has been devoured that here it is (changed), to pass to the essence of evil; from then on it troubles and opposes; now trouble will never be the source<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> of support for a being. Destroyed therefore are the foolishness of the Manichaeans like a spider's web and weaving. And one must profess one almighty God, essential light and subsistent goodness, which enlightens every man who comes into the world<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>, as it is written.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">"Whence then, they say, are evils?" — Whence? From free will. Indeed, it is in his image that God made us, when he gave a rational soul that bears in itself divine characteristics, because it is incorporeal, because it extends and directs itself by intellectual operations toward all that it wills, as far as is possible, and is in no way limited in a place, and because it can acquire virtues, for example justice and the rest.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For it is by essence, on the one hand, that God alone is just and justice itself, but it is by participation that, we, (we are so), in raising ourselves toward the imitation of him. This is why we have also been honored with primacy on earth; we have heard, indeed: "Increase and multiply and fill the earth and reign over it, and dominate over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over all beasts and over all the earth and over every reptile that creeps on the earth"<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And it has been granted to men, by liberality, to be also masters of themselves and free; and God has entrusted us with the reins of our life. Indeed, the image itself would limp very much, if we were led by some force, instead of being, according to the model in whose image we have been made, rich in free will and freedom; but we have not used this honor as was fitting; and, when man was in honor, he did not understand<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>, as it is written.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And indeed we were bound to desire spiritual and divine beauty, to obey its laws and to turn toward it the energy of (our) free spirit; after having turned our eye away from it, we descended toward sin, which is a spiritual blindness. Just as, on the one hand, God created for us an eye that can receive light and direct the steps of our feet (and that), on the other hand, if of our own free will we obscure this (eye), it is ourselves who are the cause of this blindness, in the same manner, on the one hand, he made like an eye the intelligence which (is) in us, which can understand divine things and shine with the light that (comes) from there, and, on the other hand, if we obscure this (intelligence), immediately the darkness of sin occurs in us like a blindness; now blindness is the privation of light, and God is not the author of a privation; for it is of essences that he is the creator, and not of nothingness and non-existence. Therefore sin and evil are nothingness and non-essence; for they are a change of good will.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">"But we should have been created immutable with respect to sin," they say. — These are assuredly the words of people who would legislate; and one should not, as the Apostle says, that the [vessel] of clay say to him who fashioned it: "Why have you made me thus?"<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> And those who say this seem to me, on the one hand, to despise what is reasonable, on the other hand, to prefer, instead of being men, to be rather wood and stones, which are immutable with respect to sin.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">"But we would wish to be," they say, "reasonable beings and never to be transformed and changed with respect to sin." Such then is the opinion of those who launch themselves even above nature and wish to rise up to the divine essence. Indeed, only the holy Trinity, uncreated and without beginning and not produced, is immutable in nature and not transformable; but all creation (is) subject to changes and transformations.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">As for the angelic armies, they are not immutable natures, but divine grace has seized them together with the perpetual contemplation of the holy Trinity, or rather of the illumination that (proceeds) from it. After the Calumniator, of his own free will, turned his gaze away from this vision, while he was part of one of these good armies, he became himself the instigator of darkness. Likewise the spirits endowed with intelligence who revolted together with him suffered the same fate, then became evil, and moreover out of jealousy undertook war against man. But we can say like Paul: "The love of Christ seizes us"<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>, and by the combat that takes place against these (evil spirits) he renders us more tested, but only on condition that we ourselves do not deprive ourselves of love and grace; when in truth Adam did that, on the one hand he was deceived by the Evil One (and) on the other hand he became an exile from Paradise.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">One must therefore believe that God the Father is "almighty" and that he absolutely has no opposing principle facing him, according to the impiety of the Manichaeans, and that in truth he is "the creator of all things visible and invisible"; let us not set up different gods, according to the opposition of visible elements, and let us not think that one is author of fire and another, of water. But let us consider that this world is composed of things that are opposed in a single harmony and in one (single) good order, and that because of this it is called "order"<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>, and let us praise him who thus ordered and harmonized what seems without harmony. For, when one sees that a lyre is rightly made of disparate strings to execute a single melody with harmonious notes, one compliments the cithara player.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now, when you believe in one God the Father, believe also in one Lord Jesus Christ, his only Son, who was begotten of his essence, (who is) consubstantial with the Father, who is light of light and true God of true God, the Word, the Life, the image of the invisible God<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>, the imprint of the hypostasis of the Father<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>. For it is by all these (names) that he is designated, because a single formula cannot encompass what he contains, but each of them designates a single attribution fitting to God, and this even when comparing it to other persons it is unsuitable and found inadequate. Indeed, when you hear the Son, understand by that only that he is consubstantial with his Father; for every son is of the same essence and (the same) nature as his father, according to the manner in which the latter begot him.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Do not therefore lower your thought from there to bodily births and do not think of union of bodies, emission of seed and passion. But from the designation of Son pass to that of the Word, and you will find that it is without emission of seed and in an impassible and incorporeal manner that he was begotten, like speech. For just as this speech (which is) ours is begotten in an impassible manner by the intelligence which (is) in us and that in coming out, it shows and makes known by the emission of a sound — and as if representing it — the very thought which (is) in the depth of the intelligence, so also is the ineffable God the Father, that intelligence which (is) above all, represented by the Word who came out of him by generation. And indeed it is written that he is the angel of great counsel<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> and the image of the invisible God<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>, he who says: "He who has seen me has seen the Father"<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>. This is why, indeed, he is also said to be (Son) only-begotten, because he alone came out from the Father alone and in a unique manner totally different from all other births; in this also there is no common point.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But this speech which is ours, in coming out of the changing intelligence, spreads in the air and vanishes, while the Word of the living Father and the unchanging intelligence which (is) above all, is himself also living, subsisting and equally perpetual.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For it is written: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God"<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>. Do you hear that in the beginning was the Word and that he was God? And how will you say non-subsisting he who is, like this speech, ours, which is emitted? But if the Word was and (if) he was God and (if) he was with God, he was perpetual; for he was in the beginning; now, at a beginning without time, it is not possible to find a limit. By the Son, indeed, as it is written, the Father also made the ages<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>. Now to say that the author of ages and times is later than time is folly. Therefore the Son is equal to the Father in eternity, and it is not at the end that he came into existence.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is he who became incarnate for us in the last days, and became man of the Holy Spirit and of the holy Mother of God and ever-virgin Mary. And the cause of the incarnation, what is it? It is the man made in his image, who, because of his own folly and the deceit of the Calumniator, as written previously, was excluded from the blessed and suffering-free life of Paradise.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, it befitted him who is by essence the image of the invisible Father<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>, the living Word, to come seek, after he had turned toward corruption, the man endowed with reason, made in the image of God as by participation and by grace, and whom he had sent to death saying: "You are earth, and to earth you shall go"<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>, and not only that, but also whose existence he had judged and condemned by pronouncing this decree on Eve: "In pain you shall bring forth children"<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">This is why also, without change, he participated in the fleshly condition and endured for us death according to the flesh, wishing to abolish these two sentences. Indeed, it was not within the power of any man to render them inoperative, while all had been subjected to the net and snare of death.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">"But he should have allowed," they say, "one of the spirits who perform the office of ministers<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup> to accomplish such an economy of this kind, and not that God should lower himself to that." But first, on the one hand, no one could realize this and undo the bonds of corruption, except him who by nature is incorruptible and immortal, the all-powerful force of the invisible God; on the other hand, it was not fitting for an angelic power to effect such a restoration that befits God, lest men themselves fall and decline again from the truth and serve the creation instead of the creator<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But it is to him who could, it is to him that it also befitted to bear the economy concerning us, so that those who would be saved might adore him who is at once Savior and God adorable by nature. This is why, indeed, the prophet Isaiah also cried out: "It is not a messenger nor an angel, but it is the Lord himself who saved us"<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">We shall not therefore divide him after the union according to the duality of natures; otherwise, we would expose ourselves to being accused of idolatry, in adoring at the same time as God, according to the folly of Nestorius, the man who subsists by himself. But we shall profess him one and the same of two natures, of divinity and humanity; and, in adoring him, we shall be beyond all reproach. In the same manner as we, indeed, the Word of God participated in blood and flesh<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>, which is animated by an intelligent soul. But if it is in the same manner as we, the argument thus presented in public, stirs up a conflict of controversy.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, just as, in what concerns us, when the soul has been united hypostatically to the body, it perfected man one of two, without the soul itself having been changed into body, nor the body in turn transformed into soul, and the living being is said and understood to be a single nature, without having diminished or changed or transformed these (elements) of which it was formed naturally, so also the Word of God, when he was united according to nature and according to hypostasis, to the humanity which (comes) from us, which is perfect according to its own notion, that he was born of the holy Virgin according to the flesh and that he was named Emmanuel, also shows that these (elements) from which the union was made are not confused, since on the one hand they remain in their natural quality, although, on the other hand, the properties that subsist, no longer subsist properly, as if they were still disjoined by duality; for there is only one hypostasis from the two (elements).</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Consequently one must anathematize those who say that this unique Christ after the ineffable union constitutes two prosopa or two hypostases or two natures, with the operations of these and (their) properties, and do not confess him as one prosopon, one hypostasis, one incarnate nature of God the Word, or who deny that he became incarnate (taking) true flesh and consubstantial with us, or conclude that this (flesh is) without soul or without intelligence, and who by these (opinions) render our salvation false or imperfect.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Believe therefore that God himself who became incarnate endured according to the flesh the cross for us, that he was buried, that he destroyed the corruption which (is) in the tombs, that he descended to Sheol, that he broke the unbreakable and reinforced gates, that he undid the indissoluble bonds and brought out the captives, that he rose from the dead on the third day, that he ascended to heaven, and that he sits at the right hand of the Father. And this is said, not because there is something of the Father that is to the right or to the left; for how would these properties belong to him who is infinite and incorporeal and who fills all? But it is according to the words that are in usage among us that the divine Book shows the royal majesty of the Son and the equality of honor that (he has) in relation to the Father.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">One must also believe in the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from the Father. It is thus, indeed, that the breath also comes out at the same time as our speech. However here (it is the breath) that still spreads in the air, (and) there (it is the Spirit) living and hypostatic. For the Spirit is (the Spirit) of life, who is consubstantial with the Father and the Son and who (is) counted at the same time because of this as possessing the same praise, divinity, royalty and eternity. "Go," he says, "teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit"<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>. That one also made at the same time with the Father and the Son the visible and invisible creation. It is written, indeed: "By the Word of the Lord were the heavens established, and by the Spirit of his mouth all their host"<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>. It is by that one that you will receive the gift of adoption.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">When therefore you have believed in one God, who is seen in one essence in three hypostases, renounce the slavery of the tyrant, I mean Satan, and the evil and fatal weapons that (are) subject to him, saying: "Let us break their bonds, and cast off from us their yoke"<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>. And do this by looking toward the west; then, turning yourselves likewise toward the east, proclaim the covenant with Christ, not because the side of the west has fallen by lot to the Calumniator and the evil demons — for "the earth and its fullness belong to the Lord"<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> — but in order to manifest by this attitude that on the one hand you have fled the darkness of sin, that, on the other hand, you have run toward the spiritual light and that you hasten toward your paternal dwelling, Paradise which (is) planted on the side of the east<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Because therefore you have driven (far) from you until now, by the word alone which has an invincible force, the tyranny of the evil and rebellious demon, (tyranny) overwhelming because of wickedness, but weak because of falsehood — and (the Calumniator) has shown himself fleeing and has been dispersed like smoke<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup> with those who attach themselves to him — and because you have taken refuge toward the invincible right hand of Christ, when by a word, which ignores deceit and (marks) good will, you have confessed his lordship, henceforth the Lord himself, who in the beginning fashioned from mud, seeing his creation soiled by the transgression of Adam, he himself (I say) will form you anew by water and by the Spirit.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And, when the jealous and impudent Calumniator sees you engaging on the path that (leads) to the water, recovering himself, he will pursue you anew, and he will say to his demons, like Pharaoh to the Egyptians: "Why have we done this: sent away the children of Israel, so that they are no longer in slavery for us?"<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>. But have confidence; the waters will go forward, and he who broke the heads of the dragons in the waters<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> will swallow those. But formerly the waters were deadly and bitter, before the heads of those who vomited a venom that brings death were broken; but when the sign of the cross was traced upon them, it rendered these (waters) sweet and life-giving.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And it is in a completely evident manner, by a very, very clear figure, that formerly Moses signified this in advance. In Exodus, indeed, he wrote in these terms: "Now they came to Marah, and they could not drink the waters of Marah; for they were bitter; therefore the name of this place was called Bitterness. And the people murmured against Moses, saying: What shall we drink? And Moses cried to the Lord; and the Lord showed him a wood and he threw it into the waters, and the waters became sweet"<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For whom then, even among those who are very perverse, is it not certain that this wood prefigured in advance the life-giving cross and the baptism that is accomplished by it? For what he said: "He showed him a wood," makes known the revelation of the mystery that was hidden, and on the other hand what he added after what was said: "there he laid down for them statutes and judgments"<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>, shows in advance nothing else if not the perfected laws of the Gospel.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The prophet Ezekiel also saw in advance these waters that give life and heal and give spiritual health; and he shows this, writing in these terms: "And he said to me: These waters that go to Galilee which (is) on the side of the east, and (which) descend toward the land that is not inhabited, and (which) come to the sea toward the waters of the passage of the sea, will give health to the waters. And it will happen that every soul of the animals that swarm there, all those upon which the river itself will come there, will live, and there will be there a very great multitude, because these waters come there, and it will be healed and live"<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now these waters that spring up in Galilee and cross the sea, it is the Jordan, in which the seed of holy baptism was cast by our Savior<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup>; these (waters) that descend toward the land that is not inhabited, which represents us, we who are deserts and uninhabited of all divine grace, who were idle and empty according to the word of the gospel<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup>, where seven spirits that are very evil have dwelt<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And also this (word): "They descend," shows the mercy of a charitable God, by which such grace descended upon us who were not worthy. "And it will happen that every soul of the animals," he says, "that swarm, all those upon which the river itself will come there, will live"<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup>. He calls "animals" those who, in the diversity of animal passions, have made themselves similar to animals of every kind, those whom the sea of this salty and troubled life has made swarm. But however, after the Jordan came upon them, it granted life also to those, to them who were dead formerly in the salty waves.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The prophet himself added after this: "And there will be a very great multitude, because the waters come there, and it will be healed and live; everything upon which the river will come there, will live"<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup>. This shows manifestly the renovation and re-creation of the old and dust-made man; for the first man (taken) from the earth is made of dust<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup>, as Paul says. And the divine David also sings concerning the God of the universe: "Remember that we are dust"<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup>. Indeed, since it is in the mud that we have buried the reasonable image of the soul, it is according to what (is) inferior that we are named "dusty" rather than "reasonable," since we are of the same dust.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But the prophet Ezekiel, when he saw from afar the great crowd of those who were going to come to baptism, said that on the one hand they were made of dust and that they were dead in the mud<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup>, (and) that on the other hand they were going to be healed and live by these waters: "And there will be there a very great multitude, because these waters come there, and it will be healed and live; everything upon which the river will come there will live"<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I leave aside therefore many other things that would have been necessary, because the homily would reach an excessive and immoderate length. But you, while you go toward the life-giving river, remember me, I ask you and I beg you; for until now I am submerged by the salty waves of sufferings, and you cannot grant me another grace greater than that. And the triune God will give you what you ask, because he is understood and praised as the One, in whose name you are going to be baptized. To him also be praise and glory and power, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen!</p>

        <p id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> The catechesis that is done for catechumens, that is, for hearers about to approach holy baptism, is called invitation in Greek: this is why the Master [Severus] says that this sort of teaching accustoms the ears of those who are catechized by the sound of the trumpet that introduces, but it is at the beginning of the words, as by introduction.
