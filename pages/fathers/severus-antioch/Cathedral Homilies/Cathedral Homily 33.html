    <h1>Homily 33: Man born blind</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">Concerning whom the disciples asked Our Lord: "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Do you want us to approach this man born blind and, as on auriferous earth, take a small parcel and make ourselves shine in the light of knowledge,<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> as a prophet says, starting from the beneficial and light-bearing blindness of this man? — I know well that you consent to it and that, for an occupation of this kind, you absolutely know no satiety. And indeed you hasten and are eager for us to say immediately and on the spot what would need much work. Let us approach, however, after having put our confidence, not in our talent, but in your charity.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The disciples, says the Gospel, questioned Jesus, saying: "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> It is justly and in a manner that suited what was proposed to them in advance, that they called him Rabbi, that is, teacher. Indeed the question itself needed very profound teaching. But what does he answer, he who gives wisdom, this preacher and chief? A concise and brief word as the prophet Isaiah proclaimed in advance, saying: "It is a word said briefly that the Lord will do on earth."<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> But it is a concise and brief word, which in few words contains much meaning, which has also stopped the chatter of profane sages and made it silent, because it persuaded them all together with an invincible force and attracted them to itself in an inflexible manner.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">"Neither this man sinned," he said, "nor his parents"<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>: in these few syllables, he overturned two very perverse and atheistic opinions, one pagan (Greek), the other Jewish.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">The pagans, indeed, say that souls are prior to the life of the world and that they are prior to bodies, and that, although they are spirits endowed with reason, they descended, because of a sin and by way of chastisement, and were enchained to thick bodies. And that is why indeed, they say, bodies were called thus, because it is as in a σῆμα and in a sepulcher that these souls are enclosed in the flesh; and the poets call the body σῆμα.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> Consequently, they make the wretched souls descend, even to the body of animals, wild beasts, reptiles, birds and even to trees; afterwards, they say, they are elevated again to the reasonable and first condition.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But how can it be that these souls which passed through the lack of reason and the nature of a wild beast and acquired what is proper to it and became very abject, rise back, from a state of life devoid of reason and sensibility, toward a very good end, without having removed, by themselves, what was bad in them, but after having clothed, like a bark, a new material thickness?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why, setting aside such a ridiculous absurdity, our Savior answered: "Neither this man sinned,"<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6a">6</a></sup> in order to show, concerning the soul of this man, that it is not to expiate the penalty of a sin having occurred previously, that it was condemned to be attached to a blind body. Indeed, that souls are not prior, but are created at the same time as bodies, in the manner of a new fixed state, is what the prophet Zechariah also makes known, saying concerning the God of the universe: "He who forms the spirit of man in him."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> The souls indeed were united to bodies, not to become worse, but on the contrary to make them participate in their own reasonable excellence and give it to them as a gift. Consequently, it is not only to souls, but also to bodies, insofar as they have behaved well with them, that the glory of the resurrection and the blessed and endless life is promised: concerning this, even the privation of eyes or the mutilation of other members cannot provoke pain, on one hand, because this state renders us more vigilant regarding sin; on the other hand, because, if it is borne with patience and gratitude, it prepares the happiness of the future light.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, what profit, tell me, was there for this or that one, to have healthy eyes, and to let them move without restraint to look intemperately and covetously, to go in pursuit of profane beauties, to let themselves be drawn to fornication, and, in place of a banal and defective vision of an ephemeral life, to possess in exchange the eternal darkness? For, when one compares this finite and limited world of such small measure, to the life that has no end, it is a drop compared to the immeasurable sea. And for those who are intelligent, who would think that a small pleasure is more precious than an immense and endless pleasure?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore Christ showed the falsity of the opinion of the pagans.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7a">7</a></sup> But, by the words he cited next, he showed that that of the Jews is without consistency and erroneous. While indeed they thought that children bear the penalty of sins committed by parents, and that they misunderstood the word predicted by Moses: "I am a jealous God, who punishes the sins of the fathers on the children, on the third and fourth generation,"<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> when he overturns and reduces to nothing their so false opinion and says: "Neither this man sinned," he cited immediately after: "nor his parents,"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> in order to show that this blind man does not pay the penalties of the sins of his parents.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, what was said by Moses is understood in this manner: Someone sinned, and God bore it with patience, awaiting his repentance and conversion to the good. But that one, without having converted, went away with his impiety, being sent to the future tribunals, when what is according to justice will be rendered to each, on the very just scales of God. Then the son of this father walked in the footsteps of the paternal sin, and, in the same manner as his father, left this life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Then therefore, if he who is born of that one also resembles his father in sin, this patient God shows his solicitude, when, even in this world, he renders according to justice, namely what the father of that one would also receive, if the limits of God's patience were not enlarged for the reasons known to him who directs this with wisdom. Often indeed, by tenderness, surpassing the third generation, he brings the sentence of punishment on the fourth. That is why it is not simply of the third or fourth generation that he speaks, but he adds and says: "those who hate me," so that it may be clearly shown that it is because of their own hatred, with which they hate God himself, and not because of that of their fathers, that they are guilty, even if they rivaled and imitated those.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That it is so, is what Moses himself showed also in Deuteronomy, saying: "Fathers will not die for children, and children will not die for fathers; each will die for his own sin."<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> Because of that, to the Jews who were raving and saying: "The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge,"<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> the prophet Ezekiel also said: "As I live, says the Lord, it shall no more be said that this proverb is used in Israel, because all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son, all souls are mine. The soul that sins, it shall die; the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him."<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">It was therefore shown by the words of our Savior that this blind man was born blind, neither because of his own sin, nor because of a fault of the parents, but "so that the works of God may be manifested in him,"<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> he said. But what is that? — Earlier, a few verses before, Christ said to the Jews: "Before Abraham was, I am."<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> And while these considered appearances and thought he was only a man, did not consider the depth of the mystery and did not perceive his divine essence before the ages, taking stones, they thought to stone him who cannot be seized nor held and who can be seized only by his will, when he willed it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">But, when he wants to show clearly that not only is he before Abraham, but that he is also the creator of what exists, he comes to this man born blind, in order to fix, as creator, inside the cavities of the eyes, the pupils which had not been given to him by nature, and so that the works of God may be manifested in him.<sup><a href="#fn13a" id="ref13a">13a</a></sup> How indeed is he not clearly God, he who does such things?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why, after having said these words, he cited after them: "I must do the works of him who sent me,"<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> on one hand escaping the suspicion of appearing to be the adversary of God, on the other hand making known that it is with the Father that he did all this and that it is by his hands also that he made all things. Thus the miracle he is going to do, like each of the other works, is the work of the Father, while it is done by God the Word who became incarnate, and it is not some action of a holy man who accomplishes a spiritual favor.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And look at the way of doing the miracle, as it befits God! After having spat on the ground and made mud with this saliva, he applied the mud on the eyes of this blind man and said to him: "Go, wash yourself in the pool of Siloam," which is interpreted "Sent."<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> The mud, on one hand, reminds us of the first formation, by which he made man dust of the earth, which is according to the book of Job: "After having taken mud, he formed a living being, and placed him endowed with speech on the earth"<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>; on the other hand, the pool of Siloam, that is "Sent," designates in advance the second mystical and spiritual creation, which was going to take place through baptism; and both show that Christ himself is creator and renewer. Indeed he was sent, by his will, toward us, and that by means of the incarnation, while he is present to every place as God and fills the Universe and is limited by no place, what the prophet David also predicted: "He sent his Word and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions."<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">After this blind man washed himself, he returned bearing a double light, on one hand that of the eyes of the body by the hand of the creator, on the other hand that of the eyes of the spirit by the second creation that the baptistery gives. That is why, after having shone with the light of the knowledge of God in the inner man, he cried to the Jews in a reproachful form: "Never has it been heard that someone opened the eyes of one born blind; if this man were not from God, he could do nothing."<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> And as Jesus asked him: "Do you believe in the Son of God?" He answered and said: "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?"<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> And after Christ said: "You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking with you," he cried out, saying: "I believe, Lord": and he prostrated before him,<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> crying, so to speak, the same words as the apostle Peter: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">This blind man also accuses those who, under Christian appearances, have thoughts of Jews and divide the Emmanuel himself, by the duality of natures after the union. Indeed, of what nature will they say is the operation or the property, the fact of making pupils by means of mud? For, on one hand, if it is of the divine nature, then how is spitting the property of the bodiless God, without exterior and impalpable? On the other hand, if it is of the human nature, let them hear, not us, but this blind man, say: "Never has it been heard that anyone among men opened the eyes of one born blind."<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> But if, because of us, God the Word became corporeal without change, while he is one of two natures, of divinity indeed and of humanity, which are perfect according to their proper notion, when the same is of the same essence as the Father, in that he is God, and the same is of the same essence as we other men, in that he became like us, except for sin,<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> then humanly he will spit, and, divinely by saliva, the same will make eyes without being divided absolutely in anything.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is therefore for this that we ourselves, on one hand, have been enlightened so to speak by the luminous faith of this blind man and by him who healed and enlightened that one; you, on the other hand, what recompense will you give him for the profit? Let each of you, going to his house, give three copper obols into the outstretched hand of each of these blind men who beg! And if someone has no money on him now, let him accomplish this pious recommendation on a near day! Indeed, on one hand, for the giver, it is little; on the other hand for the receiver, it is much when he gathers from everywhere at once. Let be honored indeed by three obols the faith of this blind man which surpasses all estimation! Indeed Christ also voluntarily made himself poor, he who appropriated all that is ours, without having esteemed it a dishonor, so that we also, as much as can be understood by men, may become rich with what is his<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup> and obtain the kingdom of heaven. To him be glory in the age of ages! Amen!</p>
