    <h1>Homily 20: On the Meeting of our Savior, that is, on the Feast of Hosannas and on the (word): "Hosanna"</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">This homily was delivered on Palm Sunday, March 31, 513.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">When our Lord and our God Jesus Christ was about to voluntarily go to the saving cross, to accomplish the entire Economy, to receive for us all contempt and ignominy and to humble himself unto death, as if he were standing at the threshold of this whole undertaking, he showed his invincible strength, supporting the weakness of our spirit, so that, because of his voluntary sufferings, we might not slip into uncontrolled judgments.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, in truth, after having gone down to Bethany, he raised Lazarus, who had already been four days in the tomb, breaking in advance the empire of death which he was to completely kill by descending himself into Sheol and delivering the souls imprisoned there. That is why, as one who by a simple command was going to raise him as from sleep, he said: "Lazarus, our friend, sleeps; but I go to awaken him."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Then, as children and the crowd that was with them praised this prelude of the victorious struggle over death—for this is what the evangelist John particularly indicated<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>—they went to meet him in the direction of the place from which he was descending, the Mount of Olives, near the gates of Jerusalem.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">See then how, when Jesus foreknew what was going to happen and learned that they were coming to meet him, he arranged his entrance to be worthy of God and in a way symbolic, since through it he also prefigured for us his second coming in full glory, without forgetting the little regard he had for it during all his first coming and during all the time of the Incarnation, while by successive stages he revealed his divinity in accordance with the Economy.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, he ordered his disciples to bring him a colt, not subjected to the yoke, and on which no man had sat; after sitting on it, he was ready to set out. Now this colt prefigured the believing people of the nations; for the donkey, in fact, is impure and cannot be eaten, according to the law of Moses, and it cannot be offered in sacrifice as defiled and abominable: its hoof is not cloven, and, unlike the ox and the sheep, it does not chew the cud<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now our Lord Christ, on the one hand, turned his face away from the unruly people of the Jews, and this, while he was pure and his hoof was cloven—for he had learned from the Law to separate and distinguish what is good from what is evil—and while he also chewed the cud—for he ate and ruminated the commandments of Moses—; on the other hand, he chose for himself the people of the nations, who had not been instructed by the Law given by God, had not learned the distinction of good and evil, was not under the yoke, had given themselves over to ignominious passions and had become refractory to bonds, and on which no man had sat—for there had been for them neither a judge established by God, nor a prophet, nor a teacher. Therefore, this people of the nations, who are impure like the donkey, is the one he ordered his disciples to detach from the bonds of ignorance and the worship of demons.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The three evangelists, on the one hand, mentioned that only the colt was tied; Matthew<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, on the other hand, related that the mother who had given birth to the colt was also tied, so that in truth the colt itself was tied by a double bond, by one, that of the rope, and by the other, that of nature; for it accompanied its mother, being tied by the love it had for her.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And, for its part, this figure also shows us in advance a great glimmer of truth; for it indicates, concerning the people of the nations, that it is unnatural, on the one hand, that they were bound by the bonds of sin and atheism, that is, of polytheism, and that it is as if according to nature, on the other hand, that they were attached by a long habit and could no longer henceforth cut this bond which is untranscendable and which was like their own nature.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The disciples of Christ therefore detached this colt with all ease; and they brought it to their Master, after having first put their garments upon it. And, when Jesus saw that this had been done, he who is truly the God of great mysteries, mounted it, and sat upon it. Indeed, one can still admire, by the manifest significance of the expressions, that he shows us the very truth very clearly. For, as soon as the believers of the nations have clothed themselves with apostolic virtues as well as with garments, like this donkey, so that among them arise teachers of piety and even martyrs, then, the grace of Jesus, or rather Jesus himself, sat upon them, dwelt in them and rested upon them, just as it is also written that he sits upon the Cherubim<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>, because he rests upon these holy beings themselves; for he is holy, as the prophet Isaiah says, and he rests upon the saints<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is again a prophecy, that of Zechariah, as well as the book of Matthew also, which makes known that the colt was united with the donkey; for it expresses itself thus: "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Now who, then, upon hearing "just king," does not immediately understand Christ, whom the name of Melchizedek also prefigured, the translation of which evokes "king of righteousness"<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>? Now the prophet himself did not say only "just king," but he added: "and having salvation," in order to indicate further by that the name of Jesus, which, when translated, is "salvation of God" and "healing"; and he added afterwards: "lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass," in order to show in advance the one who said in the gospels: "Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart."<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> Now never did any king, at once just, savior, meek and sitting upon a donkey, come to Jerusalem, except the one who alone is King of kings and God and Savior, Jesus, that benevolent, meek and abundant in mercy to all who call upon him<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>, as it is written.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Then, as he was sitting upon the colt, which prefigured the believing people of the nations, a great crowd accompanied him, carrying palm leaves; and not content with that only, they also spread on the path branches of olive trees and garments. But these things could not have taken place, if they were not indicative of great mysteries.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, on the one hand, the fact that the donkey walked on branches and on palm leaves made it manifestly known that not only the one who was mounted upon it, but also those who were to believe in him, would subjugate all their enemies, put them under their feet and win a glorious victory; for branches and palm leaves are the emblem of victory. On the other hand, the fact that the people, taking off their cloaks, threw them on the ground, proclaimed in an almost immediate and manifest way, what appeared afterwards in reality itself.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, when these believers were getting rid of all that they possessed and even of their garment, which is an abbreviated designation, they were following the gospel of grace. For it is written in the Book of Acts that all those who were possessors of lands and houses, when they sold them, brought the prices of what was sold and laid them at the feet of the apostles, and distribution was made to each according to his need<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>. Otherwise, if these things had not been mysteriously prefigured by what was being accomplished then, the branches and the garments would have become an obstacle for the walk of this donkey, entangling its feet like nets.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And the crowd of those who were going before him and of those who were coming after him cried out: "Hosanna to the Son of David."<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> And this (namely: "Hosanna to the Son of David"), passing from the Hebrew language to the Greek language, is translated: "As praise, or psalm, to the Son of David"; for indeed, in the pronunciation of the word, we drop a "sigma" under "sanna," so that we seem to say: "Osianna"<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>. For its part, being praised or honored by a psalm, comes not to a man, but to him who alone is God by nature, as he who says: "He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God"<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>, and: "I will sing unto my God as long as I shall be"<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And those who were crying out added still this: "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest."<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> And certainly it would have been necessary that those who were praising say according to custom: "You are welcome," as one who has come a first time, or as the ancients greeted the prophet Samuel, saying from the beginning: "Is thy coming peace, seer?"<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">For its part, the fact that they cry: "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest"<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>, and, as Luke added: "Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest"<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>, is the fact of those who proclaim his second coming, by which he will come from heaven with glory, after he will join by peace earthly things to heavenly things<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>, when he will also judge all the earth with righteousness<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>, and he will bring into the kingdom of heaven those who have lived well. That is why, in fact, it was also small children who were praising him and crying out this, they who, when he entered, also entered with him into the temple, for he himself says: "Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Consider again in what the branches were bearers of victory, by which those who were acclaiming honored the one who was praised in a manner worthy of God. Therefore, on the one hand, the evangelists who wrote that when he approached and was near the descent of the Mount of Olives, those who formed the crowd began to welcome him, to walk before him, to praise him and to cut branches from the trees<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>, show manifestly that they were branches of olive trees; for they were necessarily such as the mountain thus named (Mount) of Olives supplied.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now the plant of the olive tree indicates the reconciliation of God and his charitable coming to us, which he brought about not because of our righteousness, which does not even exist, but because of his mercy. For likewise, it is a dove holding and carrying in its beak olive leaves that made known also the end of the flood in the days of Noah and the cessation of wrath by the mercy of peace which comes from above<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">On the other hand, the evangelist John added, besides the others, still this: "When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, they took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him"<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>. O happy word of John, more elevated and more sublime than all! Truly he is the son of thunder<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>; for he thundered for us the dogmas of theology and he leaves nothing empty nor indifferent, even when he is merely making a narrative.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The palm tree, indeed, showed as being heavenly the one who is praised and who comes from above; for it, alone among the other trees, on the one hand rises towards heaven, and in its upper part makes grow—and abundantly—leaves, bearing at its top white branches, and, on the other hand, in its lower part, in its middle and up to its summit, it is rough, it goes straight upwards and it is rugged, difficult to climb and presents points on its branches.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Likewise also, he who is in pursuit of the knowledge of Christ will find a difficult and rugged path, when he advances by means of the works of perfection; but, when he attains its height, as much as it is possible to men, he will encounter the very brilliant light of theology and the revelation of ineffable things, like the palm branches which are very white.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why the spouse of the Song of Songs, who in truth is the Church of those who have believed in Christ, exclaimed: "I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the heights thereof."<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">But the fact that certain evangelists often add what is not said by the others has absolutely nothing contradictory; but it reveals a more exact narrative; for, if contradiction destroys by contrary assertions what has been said by another, such is not what is revealed with exactitude.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Such are for us the mysteries of this present feast, by which the Emmanuel showed himself true God after having added still this to what has already been said. Indeed, after having driven out of the temple the sellers and the buyers, he showed that this was his house, saying: "It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer"<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>, making known by the very facts that all the things that his Father possesses are his<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup> and that the God of the new and the old testament is one. And he healed the blind and the lame who approached him in the temple<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But, jealous, the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews, hearing the children who were saying: "Hosanna to the Son of David"<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>, burned with anger and gnashed their teeth; for it shocked them greatly that they glorified the Son of David and praised him as the Most High, just as now also are shocked those who cut him by the duality of natures which is after the union. That is why, they also said to him: "Hearest thou what these say?" And Jesus himself said unto them: "Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?"<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">And certainly if, according to the word of the impious and the division of duality, the one who was seen was other and outside of the one who was hidden; it was not necessary for him to answer: "Yea," and to appropriate what absolutely does not befit him, to confirm it by a testimony and to say: "Have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?"<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup> For it is to the author of all things and to God that the prophet David sings this, saying: "O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast ordained strength"<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now he immediately brought the very reason for which, out of the mouth of babes and sucklings, he has perfected praise; "because of thine enemies," he says, "that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger."<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> This especially shows that the psalm is said of the person of the Son; for he accepted the praise of the little ones to rebuke and confound the vengeful and vindictive Jews who, in truth, while out of jealousy they had diminishing feelings against Christ, imagined they were avenging God himself, when they formulated blasphemies against him.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But it is from the age which is still that of infancy that Christ, the author of all things, prepared for himself praise; and this is the word: "Thou hast perfected," as if he said: "The age of the children who praise, on the one hand, is imperfect, but the praise, on the other hand, is accomplished and very perfect." For how is it not perfect, this praise which was not diminished by the humiliation that was seen, but which praised the one who was sitting on a colt as equal to the one who was mounted on the Cherubim, and professed the same being truly Son of David and God Most High?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, he who by nature is the Son of God, the same made himself, without change and without confusion, according to the flesh, son of the divine David, when he united to himself the flesh which comes from the Holy Spirit and from Mary the Mother of God the Virgin, flesh which is consubstantial with us, which is animated by a living, rational and intelligent soul; for he is one, without separation, of two, of divinity and of humanity, and that is why he is one only Son, one only Christ, one only prosopon, one only hypostasis, one only incarnate nature of God the Word.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Where then are these people devoid of intelligence, auxiliaries and defenders of the imagination of Eutyches and the madness of Apollinarius? Did I need, in some manner, a deceptive juggling which belongs to the domain of dream, or did I need to subtract intelligence from the divine Incarnation, to show the innocence of the praise of the little ones? Or does the colt happen to mark a stain and a defilement in the Emmanuel, and do you want to make also of the dung what is produced from the immigration?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For indeed, while you are ashamed to declare true the first beginnings of the immutable Incarnation of the Word, will you blush for it in all things in the same manner, and will imagination be for you the veil of your shame? Or rather will you put on a shame different from that? For who, then, endowed with intelligence, is ashamed of these things which are thus worthy of God, even if they appear vile; does he not confess what is salutary for our race, does he not rejoice and does he not pride himself in these things?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Certainly, while the Emmanuel could also give me his glory, he took it upon himself to participate in my vile condition. That is why therefore he also brought help, without having diminished his plenitude and the lack of need proper to him and which is in his nature; and he wiped away sin, and it is not sin that he took; and, just as in the beginning he created man without sin and outside of all defilement, likewise it is outside of all stain, whatever it may be, that he renewed the same man by the Incarnation, when he himself became man without change.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">But it is time that we stop the homily, lest by lengthening it, we impair the brevity of the stammering of the theology of the children. You also, honor it, by leading your children not to the theaters and to horse competitions and by finding for them a pernicious amusement for the soul, but by going to the church with them and by saying to Christ himself, the author of all things and God: "Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise."<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> May God grant us also with them to obtain the kingdom of heaven, because to him belongs the eternal and endless kingship, as well as the power and the glory, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen!</p>
