    <h1>Homily 13: On the Munificence of the Pious Emperor (Anastasius)</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">On the munificence of the pious emperor (Anastasius), who had remitted some arrears of contributions and taxes for the public treasury.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">1 Vast and difficult to fathom is the depth of the economy which the Word of God and Savior Jesus Christ manifested towards our race by His coming in the flesh. But this seems so evident to us that we glorify Him only as benefactor, we acknowledge Him as creator, we then worship Him as the one who, after our creation, formed us anew for perfection, that we hold the eyes of our spirit turned downwards, and glorify in silence the one who is above all thought and all speech.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">2 Who indeed would not be astonished to see the king of the heavenly hosts pay taxes to the kings of the earth and allow Himself to be taxed along with the others, as if subject to taxes and tribute? And, what is in truth even more remarkable, while He was but a small child in the womb of the Virgin, the Mother of God: which truly appears, in every way, to be an act of humility and to conform to the rules of His self-emptying and voluntary poverty.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> For the fact of being subject to tax seems undoubtedly very human, precisely because it is visible, and yet it is wholly fitting for God.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">3 For He who is in the form of God, and who because of His charity took the form of a slave<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> in that He became man without change—for the words "He is" make known the immutability of the divine essence and the stability stemming from the fact that He is and exists continually—when He wills to abolish for us the servitude of sin, when He is symbolically imposed upon as one of those who are subject, when He severs the bonds of this servitude and tears up the sentence<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> (pronounced) against our race—who then was able to accomplish this restoration? He who by nature is free. And who is He who by nature is free? The only Son and Word of God, ......</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">20 ... for food he has (?)... he looks at the old cloak that covers him, he wants to take it to the merchant, to satisfy his distressed belly, he even thinks of selling his children as slaves and getting food with the price of what is his own nature: the arrogant moneylender is seated, more wicked and more cruel than any wild beast, insulting this wretch, mockingly pointing out the destitution as if it did not exist: he moves his fingers, calculates the interest, reckons the due date of the note, reads it aloud and threatens to deliver the wretch to prison and make him suffer cruel and unbearable (torments), if he does not quickly pay his debt immediately.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">21 Or again sometimes, when it is a poor stranger, in the very midst of winter, he expels him from his house, chases him away and immediately demands to be paid. But immediately this wretch, stiff with cold and seeing that the poor and vile garments he possessed and his so miserable rags, worth only a few obols, are thrown into the public square, that his debt is demanded and he has nothing to pay it and is as if pressed on every side, sheds hot tears over his sufferings and there is no one to put an end to his destitution.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">22 How then, O man, will you confidently say to God, "Forgive me,"<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> when you yourself have forgiven nothing, when you are indebted by many debts and myriads of sins and have shown towards your fellow man and brother the harshness of one who would have stone entrails? But why do I speak concerning a debt? Very often it is a word of insult or mockery or some other very contemptible feeling, whatever it may be, that we do not consent to forgive our neighbor; then, as if we had been scorned concerning our honor and had suffered all evils, we sharpen the sting of anger like scorpions, and, like camels, we keep this anger in our spirit and do not cease until we have returned evil for that contempt and, whereas we were wronged only in words, as we claim, we do wrong in actions.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">23 How then shall we be able to confidently say these words: "Forgive us"?<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> For—I will repeat the same thing many times—where is it just that we obtain that which we ourselves have not allowed our neighbor to share? This is what in truth a sage also said with astonishment: "While he himself is flesh, he keeps his anger and asks the Lord for his healing."<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">24 But let us remember the day of judgment: when we are in need of mercy, let us secure mercy for ourselves in advance; let us forgive liberally, in order to obtain a more liberal remission; thanks to the gift of the pious emperor, let us be converted to charity; let us pray for him and for the empress who makes peace and loves Christ, saying: "Save, O Lord, your king, and save her also, and answer us on the day we call upon you,"<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> for to you belong praise and glory and power, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen!</p>
