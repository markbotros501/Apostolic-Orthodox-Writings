    <h1>Homily 16</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">On the reason why we read the book of Genesis, that is, the creation of the world, during these forty days of fasting; on decency in our singing and on a chaste and honest demeanor. It was delivered in the great church<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">1 Is there anyone among you, among those gathered here, who, loving to learn and applying themselves to hear the divine words, has inquired privately, or has questioned their neighbor while searching with them, why, on these venerable and holy days of fasting, we read the creation of the world, which was written for us by Moses? Or would you prefer that I myself now give you a discourse on this subject? Will you truly say that you want this? Do you pretend not to be informed, and will you choose to say and endure everything, just to launch me into the race of speech and bring me to the stadium of teaching? This is how you listen with pleasure to my modest words. Therefore, I too present myself before the wealth of your affection, while I am poor, and I willingly forget the proverb that says: "You shall not present yourself, if you are poor, before the rich"<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>; and I come to speak, although I have absolutely no preparation for this instruction.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">2 But, grant me this grace: listen to me in silence and conduct yourselves properly, without bumping into one another or trying to push aside those standing nearby, as if gathering spoils. Otherwise, you harm yourselves as well, losing what you hear because of the noise you make; and we, for our part, are disconcerted and troubled, forced to repeat the same things several times and return again to the same subjects. For we must heed the divine book saying: "The words of the wise are heard in calm"<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">3 So we must now immediately state what we proposed to examine: we celebrate the venerable and holy days of fasting in honor of the salvific passion, in which we acknowledge that God suffered in his flesh, that he obtained impassibility for us, that he reformed anew through his resurrection our "vessel," aged and worn by sin, and that he calls us to a new life, in which we await according to his promise a new heaven and a new earth<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, as the prophet Isaiah and our Peter say in one of his epistles. For it is not we alone who await from the resurrection a change of being and an improvement, but it is also for all the visible creation around us that a transformation corresponding to our glory will take place, and it will participate in the splendor that will result from it.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">4 Indeed, just as now, after having been subjected ourselves to corruption coming from sin, the elements of our world are similarly subjected to corruptions and changes<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>—we see indeed that the sun darkens and the moon is eclipsed, as Job the greatest of ascetics said<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>—so too then, when immortality and incorruptibility come to flourish on our bodies in the flowering meadow of the resurrection, this visible world around us will also become resplendent with the beauty that befits it, since the good Creator, capable of changing it for the better, shows thereby that it is for our service and our utility that he brought sensible creation from non-existence into existence; in the end, it is for us that he will arrange it anew for a glorious and ageless state.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">5 This is also what the prophet Isaiah foretold, as much as it was possible to say to one who prophesies about the ineffable glory: "The eye has not seen, the ear has not heard, and the mind cannot imagine"<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> the nature of this glory: "And the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times greater on that day, when the Lord heals the wound of his people and heals the pain of his sore"<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">6 Now the sore with which we have been struck because of sin is death; and what else could one imagine to heal this sore, if not the resurrection, through which the sun, the moon, and all the other elements will shine resplendently and be reunited forever. This is absolutely just.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">7 Indeed, just as a servant, if his master behaves badly, also shares in that bad action, and on the other hand if the master turns to good, he too finds himself well disposed, so too creation, which had been arranged to serve us and which once shared in corruption, when we return to incorruptibility, will again participate with us in the honor that will result from it. This is indeed what the divine Paul also said, writing to the Romans in these terms: "For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">8 The proclaimer of the truth personifies creation itself, wanting to show manifestly the greatness of the reality, and he says that it waits, that is, it strongly desires in its expectation, in relation to the day of the resurrection, which is the manifestation of the children of God<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> and the revelation of the righteous. For expectation is said to be a prolonged observation of what is hoped for, so that the one who waits, as it were, leans his head and directs his eyes as if already seeing what is awaited. The Apostle himself, continuing to personify creation, says that creation was subjected to futility—not willingly, but because of him who subjected it—in hope, because creation itself also will be set free from the bondage of corruption, to obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">9 Indeed, after having been deceived by sin, we turned toward a vain and corrupt life; and yet, even in this state, when we slid toward every shameful desire and even toward the abyss of perdition, nevertheless creation was subjected to us, not willingly, that is, not when we were worthy of it—for one willingly submits to serve someone who is worthy, but to subject oneself to someone unworthy is not usually done willingly—but because of him who subjected it<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> through the abundance of his kindness and the richness of his goodness, who makes the rain fall on the just and the unjust and makes the sun shine on the wicked and the good<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>; not only that: justice being joined to goodness and kindness, he did not deprive of the service of creatures those who, being unworthy, once gave themselves over to vanity and were corrupted; but he had hope that the creatures too could obtain freedom and participate in the glory promised to the children of God, even if now they groan together with us and are in the pains of childbirth<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> and desire to obtain this hope.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">10 Now the phrase: "It groans together and is together in the pains of childbirth," like the phrase: "Creation was subjected, not willingly"<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>, are also proper to the form of prosopopoeia. For it is not to show that insensible creation is reasonable that the Apostle said this, but so that the word, personifying creation, might make known the force of the thought in a completely manifest, clear, and demonstrative way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">11 For it is the habit of the Divine Book to personify inanimate and insensible beings, and to lend words to beings not endowed with speech; at one time it will say: "What is it with you, O sea, that you fled? And you, Jordan, that you turned back? Mountains, that you skipped like rams, and hills, like lambs of the flock?"<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> At another time, it will happen again through the prophet Micah to cry out: "Hear, you mountains, the case of the Lord, and you enduring foundations of the earth, for the Lord has a case against his people, and he will contend with Israel"<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">12 Moses also, for his part, when he forbade all shameful and illegal commerce and unions outside the Law to those receiving the Law from him, said, as if wanting to frighten them, that the Promised Land had become an enemy to the nations that previously occupied it, as if it groaned because of dishonest actions and the magnitude of the shame, writing thus: "And do not defile yourselves by any of these things, for by all these things the nations I am driving out before you have defiled themselves. And the land became defiled, and I punished its iniquity on it, and the land itself vomited out its inhabitants"<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">13 Because, therefore, we purify ourselves in advance by fasting before the resurrection, of which Emmanuel gave us the pledge and guarantee when he rose after three days of burial...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">Missing</p>

        <p class="paragraph">14 For we do not know what to ask for in order to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, that he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>. What does he mean by these words? Know, then, inquiring listener, that "many gifts were given by God to the believers of that time and to those baptized by the apostles, as well as various favors. This is what the divine apostle evokes here for each of them, when the Spirit compels him and he says: 'To one is given a word of wisdom, and he instructed many; to another a word of prophecy, and he foretold the future; to another the gift of healing, and he healed many people; to another miracles, and he raised the dead; to another tongues, and he spoke different languages'<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">15 Now, besides this, there is the gift of prayer, which is also called spirit, and he who had it prayed for all the people. Because we are ignorant of many things that are not useful to us and because it is those that are not suitable and not useful to us that we ask for, then came the gift of prayer for the one who believed in this gift and in what is fitting and useful to the whole community of the Church; that one stood up, spoke, and exhorted the others: he therefore calls spirit, says the apostle, the one who prays for us and the soul that receives this same gift and cries out to God in groaning; and he who has merited this gift stands with suffering in his heart, with groanings he exhales in his spirit before God, and asks for what is fitting for all; and what is the sign of this is the deacon who offers the prayer for the people.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">16 Therefore, by this we should understand that the apostle calls "the spirit who prays for us" the spiritual heart and not the Paraclete, and we explain this by his words: "He who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit," that is, of the spiritual man, "that he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God"<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> and it is not because God is ignorant that the one praying informs him, but so that we may learn to pray as we ought and to ask God for what is good.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">17 For one can sing without making a sound, when the thought emits a sound from within: for it is not for men that we sing, but for God, who can incline the heart and knows the secrets of our soul. Indicating this, Paul said: "The Spirit intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, that he intercedes for the saints according to the will of God"<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>. Now what he says is not because the Spirit groaned, but because spiritual men, those in whom are found the gifts of the Spirit, practiced this when, on behalf of those who approached them in holiness and faith, they offered prayers and supplications in repentance and groaning. Let us also do this and each day pray to God and beseech him with songs and prayers.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">18 As for what he says: "He intercedes for the saints"<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>, he calls saints the faithful, for every faithful person is holy through faith in Christ, those whom he foreknew and predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">19 Who can bring a charge against God? Even if he is entirely perverse, for if God predestined or fixed and determined some to be called in hope, and others not, those whom he called and determined he justifies by mercy in baptism; and those whom he justifies by baptism, he glorifies by the effect of miracles, and it is not by their own will that he drew them to the call, even if mercy and glory come from God, how is there no charge against God; and especially because he prepares forever those whom his decree, and not their freedom, has made called, and on the other hand he torments forever those who, because he does not decree that they be called, are not called. Or perhaps he has completely rejected them thus outside the call, outside the faith, but not outside honorable favors.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">20 Where else to place this verse: "He called those whom he determined," while each is called, since "their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world"<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>. And even if each does not adhere, is not justified, and is not praised, you see that those who are to be called by their own will and by their freedom, because he knows them before they are called, the apostle testifies that he determined them; and he called them alone, and although he called them, it is as by virtue of the perfection of their being and not as by virtue of an aimed purpose.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">21 For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are Israelites, to whom belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>. But because it is for the Jews that he wishes to be accursed, then especially it was shown that it is for Christ alone that he asked this, because from them come the adoption, the glory, the worship, and the promises; for the law also comes from them. What he said concerning the Messiah and all the covenants with them, and the Messiah coming from them, and their ancestors from whom came the promises of all this; but it is precisely here that the obstacle was: they fell deprived of all these goods, that is why he says: "I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers"<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">22 By no means! For even this, I would do it out of love for him, but I would have little of these delights and this glory, because my Lord is not blasphemed, since I hear people say: these things were accomplished for show: he promised to some and gave to others; he was born of some and saved others; he promised to the ancestors of the Jews and let their sons fall; those who never knew him, he took away their goods. Therefore, since he does not say these things nor others like them, would they be said about my master? And even if they were said in an unworthy way, behold, I would cast myself out of the kingdom and out of the ineffable glory and endure all evils, but I thought there would be great consolation in my suffering, namely that he whom I love, I would no longer hear him being blasphemed.</p>
