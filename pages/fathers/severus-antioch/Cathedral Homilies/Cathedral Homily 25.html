    <h1>Homily 25: Pentecost</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">By Saint Mar Severus, Archbishop of Antioch and Patriarch of Syria.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Each of the divine solemnities contains a memorial of our redemption and the abolition of one of the sentences weighing upon humanity: how Christ was born, and how by his coming in the flesh he revealed himself to us as true God; thus we celebrate the feast wherein God becomes visible, that is, that of his manifestation and his birth. For, being born for the redemption and joy of the whole world, he destroyed that sentence pronounced upon Eve: <i>In pain you shall bring forth children</i><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. Moreover, he tasted death in the flesh<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> and by his own death he put death to death. And when he rose again, he raised us with him, and we celebrate the memory of his resurrection, which annulled what had been decreed for Adam when he spoiled of the tree against the law: <i>The day you eat of it, you shall surely die</i><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>; and: <i>You are dust and to dust you shall return</i><sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">After the resurrection, he ascended into heaven and the Holy Spirit descended upon us, fifty days being accomplished from the day of the resurrection. But he descended, not by exchanging one place for another, for how could he, who fills all things, since the Spirit of the Lord, as it is written, fills the inhabited earth<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>, but by making known and manifest to us the action of the divinity. That is why we celebrate the feast of Pentecost, for by this is destroyed the last sentence that the Lord God had decreed for our race, when he was about to bring the flood upon the earth, saying: <i>My spirit shall not abide in these men forever, for they are flesh</i><sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But this feast of Pentecost was celebrated in figure even among the Hebrews, as also that of Easter. Now it was celebrated thus: in the days of harvest, when the sheaf of presentation was taken and its fruit was ripe, a sheaf was taken from the field and raised before the Lord. But it was raised, not on the very day it had been taken, but on the day after, and, from there, they counted fifty days, and the day when this count was complete, that was the solemnity and it was called Pentecost (“Fiftieth”).</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But if you also wish to hear the written texts of the law, here is what it says: <i>You shall count from the day after the Sabbath; from the day you have offered the sheaf of presentation, you shall count seven full weeks, until the day after the other Sabbath, you shall count fifty days</i><sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Let us pass then from the figure to the reality: the sheaf of reasonable ears is that of our race, it is Christ, the Word of God who became incarnate for us, for he is our firstfruits, without corruption, just as the first<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> Adam (was firstfruits) of corruption, through the transgression of the commandment; but, that this was the first sheaf, the sacred book testifies, expressing itself thus: <i>And you shall bring a sheaf, the firstfruits of your harvest</i><sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>. Now Paul calls Christ our firstfruits, saying: <i>Christ the firstfruits, then those who belong to Christ at his coming</i><sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">This sheaf, then, just as the (first) was composed of ears coming from the field, was harvested from our race by the cross, the voluntary death, and the descent into Sheol. But the next day it was raised and sanctified by the resurrection, for Our Savior says in the gospels: <i>For them I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth</i><sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Attaching ourselves therefore to this ancient figure, we count fifty days, not from the day when the sheaf was reaped, but from the next day, which is precisely the day of the resurrection, or rather as he who speaks the truth says: this ancient figure attaches to the reality, in that it is not from the day of the harvest of the sheaf that the count of fifty days is made, but from the next day.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Let those who go astray in the wanderings of the error of Eutyches and who deny that the flesh of our Savior is of the same essence as ours be likewise confounded by the figure of this sheaf: just as the sheaf is of the same species and the same essence as the ears of the rest of the field, so also the Emmanuel is equal in essence in our flesh to us men, of whom he judged worthy to be the sheaf and the firstfruits; but behold again the mystery: he who represents in advance by this offering celebrated on this day of Pentecost: <i>And you shall offer to the Lord</i>, he says, <i>a new offering. From your dwellings, you shall bring loaves of presentation: two loaves of two tenths shall complete this one bread. The leavened loaves shall be baked as firstfruits for the Lord</i><sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, each loaf that will be offered as an oblation is a figure of the Emmanuel. For he is the bread that came down from heaven and gives life to the world<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>. From two tenths of fine flour results one bread: from the divinity and the humanity which he possesses perfectly (each) according to its notion, for the number ten is the sign of perfection, because this number ten is perfect. Now, on this day of Pentecost, two loaves were offered and not three, to show the revelation of two hypostases, I mean, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. For the Father is already known beforehand. But when these come to be known to us, we know one single divinity in the Trinity. For he who honors the Son and the Holy Spirit, honors the Father in every way, for from him is the Son, and also the Holy Spirit.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But the fact that leavened loaves are offered shows us another symbol. For, when we celebrate Easter, it is also the feast of the Passage—<i>Pascha</i> indeed means passage—we have passed, indeed, from the evil slavery of the Slanderer and the demons, thanks to the blood of the Only-Begotten, as Israel of old, from the tyranny of Pharaoh and the Egyptians and the plague of Him who had slain their firstborn, by that lamb which was sacrificed typologically. They had been ordered to offer unleavened bread, given that we no longer had anything of the sour and atheistic Egyptian leaven, as Paul also says: <i>For our Paschal lamb, Christ, has been sacrificed, so that we may celebrate the feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth</i><sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>. For those who now have come out of malice, renewed, must flee what is old.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But after having been redeemed from sin by the blood of Christ and having received the seed of the teachings of the gospel, we have been ordered to bring also fruits, therefore to offer leavened loaves at Pentecost, and the sacred book adds the reason, saying: <i>Leavened loaves shall be baked as firstfruits for the Lord</i><sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>. Firstfruits, he says, is this leaven. And that is why I do not turn my face from it, for from the old malice and sourness it frees and preserves him; it makes bread and gives life. Concerning this leaven, Our Lord says in the gospels: <i>The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened</i><sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But let us consider the figure of Pentecost, if you please, with much more diligence, for the book of the law also says this: <i>You shall eat neither bread, nor new grain roasted, nor bread baked before this day, before you have brought the offerings of your God</i><sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>. It expresses here a perfect teaching, namely that, of the new fruits and the seeds of the gospel, that is, of the bread that nourishes those who are perfect, it is not permitted to eat before the day of Pentecost, that (day) when the Paraclete came, this master of perfection.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">This also, Christ said clearly in the gospel to his disciples: <i>I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now; but when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth</i><sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>. Now, what else did he think concerning the whole Truth, if not the perfect revelation of the Trinity? For we hear Moses and the prophets say of the Father: <i>Thus says the Lord, God of Israel</i>; but (we hear) the Son show his equality of honor and power with the Father by exclaiming in the course of his teaching in the gospel: <i>It was said to the ancients: You shall not kill. But whoever kills shall be liable to judgment. But I say to you: whoever is angry with his brother without cause shall be liable to judgment</i><sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>. Now these words: <i>I say to you</i>, pertain to him who is legislator with the power that belongs to God.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But again, concerning the Holy Spirit, the servants of the new testament spoke in the same way: <i>This is what the Holy Spirit says</i>, as it is written in the Acts of the Apostles<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>, and also when Paul wrote this to the Galatians about him: <i>But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and had called me through his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me, so that I might preach him among the Gentiles</i><sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>. In the Acts of the Apostles, likewise, it is written: <i>While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said: Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them</i><sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>. You see that he whom the Father set apart and called to the service of the gospel is the same whom the Holy Spirit set apart and called: not in the manner of a servant, but personally, by his own power, as God, which shows that he is of the same essence, glory, and power, equal with the Father and the Son.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, knowing this, when you hear our Savior say in the gospel concerning the Holy Spirit: <i>For he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come; he will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you</i><sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>, know that he was speaking according to the Economy, condescending to the weakness of those who heard him, because they could not at that time understand the revelation of the divinity of the Paraclete and the fact that there is one essence in three hypostases.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, one might fear that, unable to rise to the height of these notions, they would represent the Trinity as three separate powers, and would give glory to a plurality of powers, not to the unity of power. That is why with sovereign knowledge he used these words, saying: <i>I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now; but when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth</i><sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>. And he showed that the Paraclete would be the teacher of the most perfect knowledge; but at the same time he restricted and attenuated his manner of speaking because of the weakness of those who heard him, saying: <i>For he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will take what is mine and declare it to you</i><sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Then, seeing again that by these words he seemed to diminish somewhat the divine dignity of the Spirit, he immediately reestablished it, raising it high in the minds of the disciples and, after these words, introducing it, saying: <i>All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you</i><sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>. <i>Do not believe</i>, he says, <i>that if the Holy Spirit is to say all that he hears, it is as by instruction or as by revelation, from that which is greater than him, and that he gives you knowledge, as of that which he does not have, taking it from another.</i> For just as, he says, I am begotten by my Father and all that the Father has is mine, because, being of the same essence and according to the economy, I say concerning myself that I take what naturally is mine, so also, being the Spirit of truth, he who proceeds from the Father, who has by essence what is the Father’s, is said to take what is mine. Now what is mine is nothing other than the Father.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why also when he spoke to the Jews, he mingled these words of the economy and those of theology, saying: <i>The Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all</i>, and again: <i>I and the Father are one</i><sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>; and certainly, while they could not bear to hear (affirm) his equality of honor and essence with the Father, they were going to stone him, saying: <i>It is not for a good work that we stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make yourself God</i><sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Truly important indeed is the teaching and proclamation of the holy Trinity, and there is no one among men who could make it known, except the Word of God and the Holy Spirit. That is why also, when he spoke to Moses, he said: <i>I am the Lord, and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, being their God, but my name, the Lord, I did not make known to them</i><sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>. But what is this name that was not revealed to them, if not that of the uncreated Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit? Now he said well: <i>I did not make it known to them</i>. What he did not make manifest and known, he showed as by a sign and images and as much as it was possible and as it deserved to be prefigured and taught, this mystery which was to be revealed.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why also our Savior said to the Jews: <i>Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; he saw it and was glad</i><sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>. See therefore, I beg you, the profession and the successive elevation of the teaching: from the ancient polytheism and cult of the demons of the Egyptians, he called the sons of Israel to recognize one single and unique God, and he wrote for them a law on tables of stone. Because he spoke to them as to people who were insensible like stones, or rather, as on stones written by God and written by the finger of God, as the divine book says, he kept them away from the stone and insensible gods. But when they were prepared for the knowledge of God by the sublime discipline of the law, it was then necessary that the divinity of the Only-Begotten Word be revealed; and he, the God Word, becoming without change a reasonable man and frequenting men, he makes them progress, he purifies our intelligence weighed down by the passions of the flesh.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">According to the word of Paul: <i>So then, we serve the law of God with our spirit, and no longer the law of sin in our flesh</i>; and <i>there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus</i>; and <i>they walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit</i>, given that already by the coming of the Word in the flesh we are such that we are raised to a reasonable and spiritual life, and that we are capable of aiming at the things above. The Holy Spirit is revealed to us in a spiritual way, without need of the former veil of the flesh.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">By tongues of fire he rested upon the apostles, showing by the fire that he is the same in essence and glory as he who in the fire descended on Mount Sinai and inflamed the bush without burning it and who initiated and instructed Moses; by the tongues, on the other hand, that he is of the race of the divinity of the Son and the Word and not a stranger. For the tongue and the word have multiple relations one with the other and express the movements of the intelligence. When therefore the apostles received such grace, when the tongues settled upon them, they began to speak in different tongues and to address the people of the various nations who had come to Jerusalem, the Spirit making known thereby that to all peoples equally the good news was to be preached.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But when I reflect on this, I progress still further with diligence, because by the miracle of tongues has been manifested to me the shoreless ocean of charity. For he who came forth from God for our race has abolished the ancient debt. But what was the debt? Let the divine books say it: The divine Moses wrote in the book of Creation in this manner: <i>The whole earth was one lip and one voice for all. But as men had moved from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there; and one man said to his neighbor: Come! Let us make bricks and burn them with fire! The brick served them as stone and the bitumen served them as mortar, and they said: Come! Let us build a city and a tower whose top may reach to the heavens! Let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth!</i></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now the Lord came down to see the city and the tower that the men had built. And the Lord said: <i>Behold, they are all one people and speak one language, and this is the beginning of their undertakings. Now nothing will be impossible for them in all that they imagine to do. Come! Let us go down! And there, let us confuse their language so that no one understands the voice of his neighbor!</i> And the Lord God scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth, and they ceased to build the city and the tower. Therefore it was called by the name of Babel, for there the Lord God confused the languages of the whole earth<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">This punishment and this division of languages, the Holy Spirit abolished by appearing and manifesting himself by tongues of fire. He abolished it in a manner wholly divine and altogether astonishing and glorious: not indeed that the people of the different nations heard the apostles speaking one single language, but, on the contrary, those who spoke made use of multiple languages as of one; and those who listened condescended to let themselves be persuaded, without contesting, by the preaching of the gospel. For if he had again made the language of all men unique, assent to the preaching would have seemed to be rather a matter of constraint and not of persuasion.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But whereas by multiple and diverse languages, one single faith was proclaimed, the free will of those who believed is demonstrated, while the confusion of languages of old is healed by the harmony of the proclamation. The combat with God of those men of old had caused the division of the language of the whole earth, which was one, but the knowledge of God gathered the different languages into one faith, and, in the manner of the strings of a cithara which produce different sounds, it prepared to perform one melodious song, and it accomplished the prophecy of Zechariah who exclaims: <i>The Lord will be king over all the earth; on that day the Lord will be one and his name one, spread over all the earth</i><sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>!</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why I said, beginning the homily, that every feast, so to speak, was the abolition of the sentences weighing upon our race. Such are the gifts and others like them that the manifest coming of the Paraclete brings us, and, as we have been enriched by the coming in the flesh of God the Word, we have merited still a certain mystical coming of the Spirit, so to speak spiritual and incorporeal, of him who has again poured out upon us his own gifts like dew. Concerning which Paul, enumerating them, said: <i>To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom; to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another the ability to distinguish between spirits; to another various kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues. But all these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills</i><sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">You see the richness of the superabundance of the gift worthy of God, and the power of this Spirit who distributes by his own will, to each one, as he wills, the divine gifts. How then do you claim that the Spirit is not God and lower to the level of creatures him who is uncreated, author of the serving and heavenly powers, and, for us men, not only our creator, but also the giver of all wisdom and understanding? For David says: <i>By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host</i><sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But someone in the manner of a philosopher says in the book of Job: <i>The divine Spirit has made me, the breath of the Almighty teaches me</i><sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup>. God the Word therefore manifested himself in us who live on earth, while he humbled himself, and without change became man, and accomplished in a calm and peaceful manner the economy, according to the prophecy of Isaiah saying: <i>He will not quarrel or cry out; nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets; a bruised reed he will not break; a smoldering wick he will not quench</i><sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>. Having thus frequented men as a man, he endured voluntarily in the flesh the cross for us, he alone tasted the death that gives life; he raised us with him, we who were dead, because he is the firstfruits of the resurrection.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">In honor of this great deed and such help, during these fifty days, we do not kneel on the earth in our prayers in any way, but, standing upright, we stretch out our hands, praising him who was crucified, buried, and risen; and, against our enemies, the Slanderer and the demons, with David, we sing: <i>They bow down and fall; but we rise and stand upright</i><sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But as the Holy Spirit, in a manner worthy of God, manifested himself and appeared to us, and as the divinity by tongues of fire illuminated us and poured out the abundant richness of his spiritual gifts—<i>I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh</i>, he says indeed—as before him whose sight we cannot bear and who astounds us by the greatness of the superabundance of his gifts, we bow down toward the earth and we bow down on our knees, glorifying the giver of these gifts which are so great.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Moreover, as we are purified by fasting and have straightened our spiritual life, it is the custom for those who are worthy of divine visions to kneel on the earth and to proclaim by this attitude the sublimity and greatness of the vision. This is what the disciples experienced, when the outward appearance of Jesus was transformed on the mountain and he showed something of the brightness of his divinity: For, says (the evangelist), <i>they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid</i><sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Certainly the tongues of fire disturbed and astonished them in their spirits, but they did not at all let themselves go to kneel on the earth, so that one might see well these tongues which had settled upon each of them.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But we, in their place, here is what we do: by bowing on our knees we tremble before the Majesty of the divine coming of the Spirit, we adore and praise him as Lord and God, but at the same time we show that by the Spirit we have learned the perfect adoration which begins with the Father and which is completed in the Spirit, which has its term and which ends in him; for everything that is outside of these three hypostases is not worthy of adoration, but is instituted for those who adore: for the property of the uncreated and immaterial divinity is to be adored in spirit and in truth, because God is Spirit and those who adore him must adore him in spirit and in truth<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why, indeed, this Holy Spirit is also called Paraclete, that is, intercessor, because he dwells in our hearts, because he incites and urges us to what is best and he teaches us not only to adore, but also to pray in spirit. Therefore Paul also, writing to the Romans, said: <i>For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words</i><sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Let us not cease to practice this at all times, but let us show a pure life, and, venerating these tongues of fire, let us turn our faces away from pagan defilements, from blasphemy, from demented and foolish words, and let him, by divine words, burn and baptize our tongue; let us not soil it with mud by earthly words, but let it be in feast every day thanks to heavenly things and let it praise the one God in the holy Trinity, to whom be glory and power for the ages! Amen<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup>.</p>
