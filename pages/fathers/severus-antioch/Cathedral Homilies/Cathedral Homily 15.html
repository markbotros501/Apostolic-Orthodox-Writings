    <h1>Homily 15: Lent</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">It was delivered on the preceding Friday in the church of Cassian<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">1 It is a rule, even in bodily competitions, that before the actual day of combat, as in preliminary engagements, the athletes contend with one another. So I too call this day a preliminary combat and the beginning of the fast of forty days. Therefore I deem it very fitting that I speak to you today on this subject, especially in this church, whose spiritual foundation, and even the one made of stones, was laid by the apostles themselves, who after Christ are the legislators and guardians of this fast, which they established for us—not as austere men worthy of being cursed (because they would have wanted to make us thin by lengthening the cycle of fasting days), but as men who wish to purify our soul and cleanse the image of God within it, which has been obscured by dishonorable passions and can no longer behold nor receive the brightness of Him who called us from darkness into His marvelous light, as the apostle Peter says<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">2 For just as a cloud, running before the sun, hides the radiance of its rays, and as smoke attacking the eyes, provoking stinging tears, blurs and troubles the sight, so too the smoky exhalations of fleshly desires arising from satiety and pleasure become for the soul a cloud and smoke and do not permit it to look with spiritual eyes upon what is above—though it is from above—nor to know the nobility of its origin and to say, as it is written: "It is a divine Spirit that made me, and the breath of the Almighty that teaches me"<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>. But like leaden chains, they weigh it down and drag it downward and make it cling to the earth; for "the earthly tent burdens the spirit that has many cares"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, as a wise man said.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">3 Therefore, as an absolutely necessary remedy, this physician of our souls prescribed fasting for us who are sick, saying: "When you fast, anoint your head and wash your face"<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>. First, according to the obvious sense, when He turns us away from vainglory and clearly cries: "Do not look gloomy like the hypocrites"<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>; then also when He raises us and lifts us up to a most divine thought, commanding that by fasting we anoint and make shine the head of our inner being, which is the ruler of the soul, and wash by this fast the eyes of the spiritual face, according to what is said by Qoheleth: "The wise man has his eyes in his head"<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">4 For he who purifies the intellect (which is this head) by fasting and the other works of perfection, stimulates the intellectual operations like eyes, for the contemplation of what is excellent and most high and for the consideration of God. For indeed, on a bodily head both the wise and the foolish have similar eyes that do not differ in position nor change in function; but for the eyes of the spirit, fasting takes the place of oil and water and has their virtue: of water, in washing away and sweeping like river floods earthly cares and belly-centered preoccupation and the evils that come from it; of oil, as what also lights our steps like a lamp, eagerly seeking the straight, narrow, and hidden paths of perfection, anointing us for combat against the enemies, arming us by deprivation of food against the foodless fighters—the demons, who neither eat nor drink—rousing us for battle, awakening us, and crying out with Paul: "We do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places"<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">5 But see, the discourse, progressing, has taught the cause of fasting: namely, combat against the demons and against the evil spirits. But in what does the combat against them consist? In the heavenly places. For it is because of the heavenly places that we struggle on the one hand, when we strive to ascend there by means of fasting and the sweat of perfection; on the other hand, when the demons and the Slanderer who is their chief violently strive to make us descend from there and stop us when we journey toward those goods by means of good works, and mislead our steps<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">6 For he who was an angel is now Satan and the adversary—for that is what the Hebrew word "Satan" indicates—having been created for good by God and by the only Creator who is good and made all things good and very good<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>. Afterwards he became sick with pride by a movement of his free will and lifted up his neck, as it is written, against the Almighty Lord<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>, then turned away from the contemplation of the first and essential light and closed his spiritual eye, filling himself with darkness to the point of becoming capable of all malice. And for this he is called by the sacred books "the throne of iniquity"<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>, as the one in whom all malice rests. He fell from the first and highest rank. So also the armies that revolted together with him, who themselves also had been created from among the ministering spirits<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>, who were also good and became sick with wickedness together with him.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">7 It is therefore for this reason and because of the sting of jealousy that they became sick, and it is intolerable for them to think that we obtain those goods from which they themselves were destitute because of their sickness. But God, our Creator, that skillful and wise captain of the combat, who turns everything to good, used the wickedness of these beings for our instruction, restraining the arrogance and swelling of their pride, while we who are of earth are in a happier condition than those who once belonged to a higher and superior category; and also, by exhibiting us in a struggle with enemies hard to fight, with more brilliant athletes, and calling us to more magnificent and distinguished crowns.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">8 But truly, though it should not have been necessary, after we fell in the first fall through Adam's transgression of the commandment, the Word of God, remaining what He was and having become man for us without change, appropriated this struggle which is ours and took upon Himself the combat against our enemy. And just as He was baptized for us—not that He needed purification, but purifying the waters beforehand, Himself becoming a bath for the Jordan, delivering it from the domination of demons, and breaking, as it is written, "the heads of the dragons on the waters"<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>—so also for us He took upon Himself the temptation of the Slanderer and submitted to the struggle, beforehand calming the combat directed against Him for us who had been wearied and weakened, and making easy to subdue the enemy and adversary so difficult to conquer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">9 Consider then what was the immensity of His love for mankind and how the economy was for our race like a model to contemplate, the prefiguration of a perfect conduct and the symbol of piety. For what does the sacred book of the Gospels say? "Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the Slanderer"<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>. What are you saying? Would it be involuntarily that He was led by the Spirit to endure the temptation of the Slanderer? While we, on the one hand, govern our life by free will and voluntarily and by free power come to the works of perfection and bear temptation concerning them; and He, on the other hand, would not be led to this voluntarily? How is it not foolish even to imagine such a thought?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">10 But this saying, "He was led by the Spirit"<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>, means this: He came to a sublime and spiritual conduct, in order also to provide an occasion for the Tempter. And this too agrees with the proceedings of His voluntary emptying. For taking it upon Himself to become man without change, by that very fact He accomplished everything human on our behalf, showing that we ourselves, after baptism, once enriched with the gift of filial adoption, must advance toward a higher life and be led by the Spirit, and not by the will of the flesh, according to what Paul also, writing to the Romans, said: "For all who are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God"<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>. For He to whom the Holy Spirit is consubstantial, because He is God and consubstantial with the Father—how would He have need of a spiritual and higher life? But, as I said, He prefigured in Himself, as a teaching and according to the economy, what is useful and fitting for us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">11 And how would temptation be necessary for Him who bore the sin of the world<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> and heard from John: "I need to be baptized by You, and You come to me?"<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>, if He had not appropriated my temptation in order to make the inflexible tempter yield for me? That is indeed why He also fasts and, after forty days, voluntarily took hunger upon Himself, without exceeding the measure of the fast of Moses and Elijah<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>, which He Himself had fixed for them, in order to provide the enemy with an occasion for combat. For if He had exceeded the number of forty days, the Slanderer would have feared to fight with Him, having discovered His divinity and being unable to consider Him as a man who would be an example.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">12 That is why also by words from the Book inspired by the Spirit, lowering and humbling Himself, Jesus Himself drove him away when he excited Him to boastfulness and pride and said at one time: "If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become loaves," and at another: "Throw Yourself down from here"<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>; and He performed no action and uttered no word pertaining to the natural glory and power worthy of God that He possessed. For it was our instruction and formation that was aimed at by what was proposed, so that we might be educated and learn how to fight against the enemy and adversary opposite us. Consequently, as soon as this was finished and the Slanderer had departed, immediately Jesus showed His superiority and inaccessibility; for the angels also approached and served Him<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> as the Lord and He who is God by nature.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">13 From this teaching has arisen for us this annual law, as well as the cycle of forty days of fasting, which possesses within it a mystical and mysterious number. But apply your mind with me, so that we may learn why we fast only forty days and not fifty or sixty. We know from the writings of Moses that he says: "God made this visible world in six days, and He rested on the seventh day"<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>, because the seventh is the total time of this life. For returning upon itself and turning like a circle, the week accomplishes this age which lasts but a time, given that when it will be completed, the day of the Lord will come then, that great and resplendent day<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>, which in truth is counted, on the one hand, as the eighth, if counted together with this life, and on the other hand, as the first and only, with respect to the future age.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">14 For then neither night will make it cease, nor will another day succeed or replace it by surpassing it and taking its place; but it is unique and cannot cease: toward it we all hasten, because it is both eighth and first, the one awaited by the spirits of the just from the beginning until now. When we pray to obtain this day, we also purify ourselves, and our purification itself consists in this: not to sin through one of these five senses—hearing, sight, touch, smell, and taste; for these are the entrances of sin, through which is accomplished every desire that leads to death, which also the prophet Jeremiah, lamenting, said to those who sinned: "Death has entered through your windows"<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">15 Having given these explanations, let us return to speak of what we had proposed and see why we fast only these forty days. Why? To prepare ourselves for that eighth and first day, that important and resplendent day, the day of the Lord. For those who purify eight times these five senses through which sin gains entrance—I mean hearing, sight, touch, taste, and smell—fast forty days, in order to obtain the blessed day, that eighth and first day; for the number five, returning eight times, completes the number forty.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">16 Those days also, Moses the lawgiver fasted<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>; those days also, Elijah the prophet fasted; those days still, Jesus the Lord of the Law and the prophets, the God of the Gospels, the Teacher and preacher of the future life, fasted. That is why again Moses, after leading the ascetic life outside Egypt for forty years, then saw the conduct of Israel; the people also, after remaining in the desert for forty years and being formed, then entered the promised land. Now these things happened figuratively to them, as Paul says, but they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">17 And now, having learned the causes, reasons, and goal of fasting, let us explain its practice cheerfully. But do not be sad, do not weep because of the deprivation of fleshly enjoyments, do not fill the hours with yawning and laziness, do not lift your hands above your heads to relax, do not lean against walls, do not gaze open-mouthed at the sun, do not await the end of the day like a traveler who has set out at an inopportune time and, out of disgust, begins to count the weeks, calling one the first, another the middle, and another the last; do not devote, according to your fancy, some to fasting as holy, attributing on the other hand the usual food to the other weeks that are in the middle of Lent and assigning them the value of a pause and rest, as between two combats.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">18 Who made this a law for you, O man? Truly, it is your belly. But you too, say to it: "It is forty days that He ordered you to fast, miserable insatiable one, and you lay down laws contrary to Him who gave the orders." Beware lest He strike you with an illness: then you would be afflicted with a forced hunger and would fast those days without reward and unwillingly. Fast therefore all the days willingly, thanking this lawgiver and physician and rejoicing in the flesh for what the remedy of fasting aims at. And if you wish not to notice the length of the day, nourish your soul with divine thoughts, both in the Scriptures and in the writings of the doctors and mystagogues of the Church who have explained them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">19 But if you possess a manual trade from which you draw resources for living, take in hand the instruments of this trade, practicing what is customary to it, but let your mouth sing psalms instead of Satan's songs and dance tunes, and let what is sung have a sense that spreads blessing and grace upon your labors. And if sometimes there is someone sitting near you who is unoccupied—even your son who still follows the lessons of his reading and writing teacher, or of masters of other disciplines—after you have sung the psalms you know, give him a copy of the divine Book and ask him to read it. And let your wife also be near you, if possible, and let her have her wool basket with her, and let her listen attentively. And if you have a hired person or a child as servant or a maidservant, do likewise; for Moses also gave this prescription to those who are still led by the formation of the law, who still need milk and are still mere infants in divine things<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">20 Make your house a church, you who have merited these instructions which are most perfect and evangelical. But perhaps you will say: "I do not know how to sing, and I cannot abandon my work; shall I then die of hunger? Shall I take the book of Psalms, recite and learn Psalms?" Hear then the word that cries to you: "How long, sluggard, will you lie down?"<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>, and often through such a long winter night? Wake up a little, go to church and listen to the office of the psalms; and you will be touched within by divine love, you will choose for yourself to keep vigil instead of sleeping, and you will say that those who sleep are as in death; and you will go at night to sing to the Lord, and in the daytime you will fill your mouth with sweetness with the same honey, and you will meditate on the law of the Lord, as it is written, day and night<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">21 But there are some who have no trade and go about aimlessly and doing nothing; but they "go about"<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>, as Paul says, and it is to the spectacles of horse races that they go. Why then, someone will say, do you order us to despise this new favor of our pious emperor, this so liberal favor?—For my part, I will answer you quite appropriately: Tell me, did he give this gift for that purpose, namely that you despise the Church and ridicule the holy days of fasting? Absolutely not; but it is so that we put an end to these evils which are so great—because, in truth, you are inclined to mischief, which he cannot prevent—by urging toward perfection, imitating in this even parents weary of their children, who give their little ones nuts and dice for their games and order them to amuse themselves, lest if they come to cross the gate, they fall into wells or water ponds, or, fleeing instruction and teaching of the letters of the alphabet, they meet thieves of objects or prison escapees who rob people.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">22 For you then, if your dispositions are not childish and foolish, let the horse race pass; for you who do not watch it, let it be a superfluous and useless spectacle. And when the pious emperor sees that our whole city, or its greater part, has such perfect dispositions and does not go to watch as to men, he will bestow favors that are much more precious than all. For he himself prays to see all the people gathered in church, where he has been assiduous all his life, attending vigils, singing and praying there—which he does in truth by leading the ascetic life even with the scepter and crown, which is also a safeguard for him.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">23 But what has been said is not sufficient, in my opinion, only to preserve the one who fasts; for there are indeed many other things that I am not permitted to say for lack of time. I will say only this in place of all the rest: namely, that he who fasts must place in the hand of the poor the price of the food he would actually have eaten if he had taken the midday meal, and that by his fast he may feed the hungry Christ. For it is beautiful, O most dear, and quite profitable, that Christ thereby notices that you have fasted and that through the piety that shares the gift, you have lit the lamp of abstinence; for not every perfection pleases Him, even if it is real, when frank piety is lacking. Let us acquire that abundantly with the rest, and we will obtain the kingdom of heaven. May it come to pass that we all obtain it by the grace and charity of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, to whom be praise with the Father and the Holy Spirit, unto the ages of ages!</p>
