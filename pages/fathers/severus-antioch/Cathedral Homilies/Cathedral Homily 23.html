    <h1>Homily 23: The Word became flesh</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">Pronounced in the great church on this (word): "The Word 'became' flesh and dwelt among us" <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. And that we must care for the poor, both during our life and when we dictate our last (will).</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">I remembered that towards some of you, I owe a particular debt that I thought I should pay in full to the whole Church. For I had promised to explain how we must understand what was said by John, the theologian among the evangelists: "The Word 'became' flesh and dwelt among us" <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. In doing this, I do not diminish the promise made particularly to a few, by the fact that all will share in the payment of the debt, for the profit of spiritual things cannot be diminished, especially of words; in this way, for each of the listeners, (the debt) will be discharged and at the same time each will have passed it on to his neighbor.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">We say, therefore, that God the Word, who was begotten by the Father in an ineffable manner before the ages, who, in essence, glory, kingship, power, and eternity, differs in nothing from the One who begot Him, came to a voluntary self-emptying and became incarnate of the Holy Spirit and Mary, Mother of God and Virgin. For, at the very moment when Gabriel said, "Rejoice, O full of grace, the Lord is with you" <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>, we believe that at the same time the Word became flesh at that short instant and at that indivisible moment of time, in an inexplicable manner and in the way that He alone knows, in the womb of the Virgin: and it was not, indeed, a simple word, but an indication that became a reality, this announcement that had been spoken by the archangel; but we say that He became flesh, not that He was changed into flesh—far from it!—for as God He is superior to all change, but that He united to Himself a flesh, one that is equal to us in essence <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, endowed with a soul and intelligence, in that hypostatic union.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Not that the flesh separated from the Word had a subsistence, but as soon as it came into existence, at the same time it was united to the Word, who is without beginning and before the ages. For, with that subsistence which is His, this union affected the Word at the same time, and this is, as far as it is possible for man to say it, the unity of hypostasis; not that with the child who is formed at his origin there is a closeness of kinship or of a directing love on the part of the Word, but it is a reunion and a natural meeting like that which one can also see in the man that we are.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For we are (composed) of a soul and a body: natures dissimilar and of unequal essence one relative to the other. Certainly the mode of intimate union produces a single nature without change; the reunion of the two is a composite: a single living being, from two (elements): one man, and we know that there is a natural union there. But the proper manner in which the unity is produced, that is to say the mode (of union), one can neither comprehend nor express.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now this image, I mean (that of) our constitution, Paul introduces as proof of the divine incarnation by saying: "Since therefore the children had in common blood and flesh, He too likewise partook of the same (elements)" <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>, wishing to show by an inexpressible resemblance this mystery still more inexpressible.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For, just as a child is already the rational man that we are, namely a soul endowed with intelligence—for that above all is what a man is: we are indeed a soul and an intelligence; but the body is not us, but (it is) ours—(the man) partakes of flesh and blood, and he unites them according to nature; in the same way also, the Word of God partakes of the same (elements) by uniting to Himself blood and flesh, because He has a rational soul.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus, from two natures, divinity and humanity, which He possesses perfectly according to their concept, one (single) Christ is understood, one (single) <i>prosopon</i>, one hypostasis, one incarnate nature of God the Word. For we also say that He was conceived and that He was born, because He united to Himself a body that can be known and be born; likewise also, the holy Virgin is believed and confessed by us as Mother of God, just as He who is born is called Emmanuel.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now, from this comparison of the child and the man that we are, one must make use only to render vivid and represent the unity; for such is the value of comparisons that, in a certain way, they resemble what is proposed, but, in a certain way or in large part, they remain outside the resemblance. For likewise, concerning the man that I am, the soul, no one has seen it come into existence apart from a body, nor a body without a soul.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">But, concerning the Emmanuel, it is a blasphemy to think or to say anything similar. For God the Word, it is not the Incarnation that is for Him the cause of His being, for He is the One who is before the ages, above cause, reason, and time, being, like the Father and the Holy Spirit, the cause for all creatures of their becoming and their life; and for us also, besides having brought us into being, He has further graced us with a better being through the inhumanation.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, "the Word became flesh" means that He became man without change, while remaining God. For the divine book knows that flesh gives its name to man, and on the other hand that the soul alone, which is only a part, designates the whole living being, as where it says: "Hear my prayer, all flesh shall come to You" <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>. And: "Let all flesh bless His holy name" <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>. And, on the opposite side, Moses, speaking to the people of Israel, says: "With seventy-five souls, your fathers went down into Egypt" <sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But the evangelist does not simply say that the Word became flesh, he wishes moreover to show His ineffable charity. For if He had united to Himself a soul alone, endowed with intelligence and without a body and which would be in His image, in that case, this mode of economy would not be worthy of admiration, for it would be somewhat like Him, congeneric with the divinity and in no way alien and exterior, since it is endowed with intelligence and without a body.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But the fact of taking upon Himself, at the same time as the soul, the opacity of the flesh and of descending to that point, in order to give us the gift of a perfect salvation, that is more worthy of admiration and truly surpasses every wonder; given, then, that it is this that the evangelist admires and which in truth astonishes every mind, he exclaims with astonishment that the Word became flesh <sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">It is said: "But to say that He becomes something makes Him depart from His own nature, since He is changed into that (being), when it is said that He becomes. It is said indeed somewhere in the book inspired by the Spirit that the wife of Lot, when she turned back to return to Sodom, remained fixed, because she had become salt <sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>. And concerning the staff of Moses that he had thrown to the ground, it had become a serpent <sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>. Therefore also, when the Word became flesh, we say that, of all necessity, a notion of change has been introduced."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">What then will you say further, when you hear David singing: "Lord, You have been for us a refuge from generation to generation" <sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>? And: "The Lord has become for me a refuge" <sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>? Now has God undergone a change, in His own nature, changing from what He is, God, to become a refuge? Or again, when you read this: "Abel became a keeper of flocks" <sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>, do you understand that Abel was changed and that he left his own nature, or rather, that he took on the fact of becoming a shepherd, in addition to the fact of being a man that he was. Thus the expression: "He became" does not signify a total change, but that, with what (one is), one takes on in addition something that one did not have. Besides the fact that this indicates the proper value of the expression, it shows that it does not indicate a single genre and proves that there are different significations.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Concerning the assumption of the flesh that God the Word united to Himself, we do not speak of it as if He had taken on a trade, like Abel who took on in addition the trade of shepherd; nor as if He assumed a function, as it is written: "All Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the Lord" <sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>; but in a natural and hypostatic unity, as we have said above, because it is also said that He became a curse <sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>, given that He destroyed the curse, because He took upon Himself, in our place, the accursed death, as Paul also says: "To those who are under the law I became as one under the law (though I myself am not under the law) so that I might win those under the law" <sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>. But it is clear that, when He abolished the dark observances of the law, Our Lord also became in this manner a curse—while He is not subject to the curse—in order to win those who are subject to the curse.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is therefore also proved by this that the expression "He became" offers diverse senses, for it is not in the same manner that He became a curse to remove and suppress the curse; and that He also became flesh, to remove and suppress the flesh, that would be to utter the worst of all impieties, but He became man without change, while at the same time remaining God, so that I too He might render incapable of being dragged away by sin, by installing His own stability in this changeable and weak nature.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why indeed the divine evangelist adds: "and dwelt among us" <sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>, in order to show that the Word did not undergo a change with respect to the flesh. For one thing is he who sojourns and the place where he sojourns; but, for all that, we do not think that the inhumanation of the Word is a simple sojourn, to the point of saying, like that madman Nestorius: "He clothed Himself with our nature, for humanity has become for the Word a tent"; and again: "Because of the one who is clothed, I honor the one who is clothed; because of the one who is hidden, I adore the one who is visible" <sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>, as if it were a matter of constructions and artificial temples; or as if it were a matter of the imperial purple and a mantle over garments. For, that this word of sojourn <sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> is also said of those who are united in one person, Paul testifies, he who says concerning our body: "If our earthly house—a tent—is destroyed" <sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>, and again: "For indeed we who are in this tent groan, being burdened" <sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">In the same manner, then, as the soul, while its own body is for it a tent, is united to it in nature and hypostasis and this union of two is one man, so God the Word, while He became flesh and sojourned in our composite and in all things became like us, except for sin <sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>, is one without change and undivided, far from being other He who clothes and other He who is clothed, according to the impiety of Nestorius.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But there are still those who have given a different explanation of this passage: this word "He dwelt among us" is the same, they say, as what the prophet Jeremiah prophesied through Baruch, when he says: "This is our God; no other can be compared to Him. He found the whole way to knowledge and gave her to Jacob his servant and to Israel whom He loved. Afterward He appeared on earth and lived among men" <sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore what the evangelist says: "He dwelt among us" <sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup> means that He took it upon Himself to dwell with us and lived among men, by becoming truly man. For John the evangelist did not need, they say, this addition to remove that suspicion of change. He put it at the beginning, because this beginning of theology, which makes everything under heaven tremble, is the foundation of the whole mystery of religion <sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>. Not only does it show the being of the Unique, who is before the ages, but it also sets forth in advance a teaching on the inhumanation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">For when he says: "In the beginning was the Word" <sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>, by the words "In the beginning", he wards off the impiety of those who say: "There was a time when He did not exist," since He "was in the beginning." But, to be before the beginning, while being outside of time, is, it seems, among the impossible things. By the expression he uses: "And the Word was with God" <sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>, he has shown that the Word as hypostasis is other than the One whose Word He is. Now, by saying: "And the Word was God" <sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>, he makes it understood that He is hypostasized, which is not the case with our word, which, by the emission of a sound, traverses the air.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But when he says: "The Word was God, and He was with God" <sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>, he has shown clearly that the two are one essence, although they are not one hypostasis, because indeed there is only one divinity for the two, and it is the same essence. Then, as if to summarize all that is said in the chapter, he briefly adds the following words: "He was in the beginning with God" <sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But what I say now, these are words that enrich us, not only for theology, but also for the concept of the inhumanation, given indeed that the evangelist, or rather the Holy Spirit who spoke through him, knows the weakness of human thought which cannot receive in a manner worthy of God this word: "The Word became flesh" <sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>, given that its ear has not been initiated beforehand by theology, and that, in any case, it loses itself in opinions creeping on the ground and despicable, because one thinks of a change concerning Him who is without change.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why he first put: "In the beginning was the Word and He was God and He was with God" <sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>, so that what "became" is not understood as a return to what was. For He who is without beginning, by the fact that He exists, for Him this fact of existing is without change and fixed. That is why also He said to Moses: "I am He who is" <sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>. Therefore when you hear that He who is became flesh, you do not understand another (being) who, by departing or by coming out of what He was, is no longer what He was in a true and hypostatic unity, for it is the same hypostasis. That is why no other evangelist, except John alone, says: "The Word became flesh" <sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>. And although we believe that the Holy Spirit speaks in all, nevertheless it is well known that this (word) also, He drew it from that (source) where He drew His theology, He who rested on the bosom <sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> of Wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">For he who said: "In the beginning was the Word" <sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>, at the same time, directly and immediately follows with: "The Word became flesh" <sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>, wishing to say that it is not by putting "He was" that we must understand in the same way that "He became." For just as "He was" designates the natural divinity of the Unique, so also "He became" shows the true and not imaginary inhumanation and also that the Word came by charity to a human birth, although without seed.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">This reasoning indeed uproots with its roots the abominable ineptitude of the imagination that some have falsely invented concerning the divine inhumanation. For, if the Word is without change, since He was God and He is with God, and that continually, how does He become flesh? For He does not say that He was seen and that He appeared, as the fox of (fertile) imagination would insinuate, but He says: He who, having taken hypostatically a flesh animated by a rational soul, became man, while at the same time He remained God. Just as He became flesh, so also He appeared in the flesh, He was seen by angels, as the wise Paul has written <sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup>. Bring in indeed beforehand into your mind: "He became", so that, since you accept well "He was seen" and "He appeared", you do not deviate by falling outside of a religious thought.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Given, therefore, that it has been sufficiently thus (given) to theology, that the suspicion of change has been cast far away, and that (the phrase) "The Word became flesh" <sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup> rejects both imagination and doubt, the evangelist did not have need of the addition: "He dwelt among us" <sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup> to distance change.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For, if it were so, they say: "Thus he said: 'The Word became flesh and He dwelt among us'" <sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup>. But by saying "among us", he means that He lived among men <sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup>, according to the expression of the prophet.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Given, therefore, that we have on this verse which was proposed to us this double exegesis, let us no longer despise either one of them, each of them being indeed worthy of God, since it neither crosses nor displaces the boundaries of religion that our fathers have established <sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup>, according to what is written.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">What excuse shall we have, then, if the Word, because of His pity for us, became flesh and dwelt among us <sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup>, in order to render us spiritual instead of carnal, and that He elevates us by flying up to heaven, but that we, by the passions, obscure our intelligence and that our mouth aspires to those goods which are on earth, without us making the slightest account of those which exist only in heaven and which we can buy even at a very minimal price. For, if you fed your brother when he is hungry, and when he is thirsty, you gave him to drink and through him to Christ, you would receive a share of that which was announced by the Charity who said: "Come, you who are blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world" <sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But there are people who have such low and pitiable dispositions: they have no children; they have no reason by nature to not show a good face, not having sufficient motive to refuse to give to the poor, for those who are born have in heaven a rich Father who loves His children, it is even He who gave them life. But they show to the poor only entrails of iron, and that, not only when they are alive, but even when they leave this world or make their testament, so that, even once dead, they will show (still) their invectives and their lack of gentleness towards their fellow men.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">As for the good that they did, while they were still alive, they were (already) dead. But once dead they still commit iniquities, as when they were still alive. For they have inscribed, as their heir, not Christ, but one of those persons who in this world are in abundance and powerful, who, by flatteries had seduced them and had made them participate in confidence in certain interests of here below.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Awake, wretched one, regain sound thoughts and know who is the Lord of glory and of the true honor that cannot be overthrown. Reflect, I pray you, on that dreadful and glorious coming of Christ, on His descent from heaven, on the terror caused by the angels and the other incorporeal powers, on the resounding noise of the trumpet that causes fear and an unspeakable terror among sinners, and that gathers the elect in such a comforting manner from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other, as it is written <sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">When, then, will you be honored, envied, and proclaimed blessed? Before that illustrious assembly and before all rational creatures? or else in the chamber of a very rich man, resplendent with its alabaster tables, its paintings, its pavements of golden mosaic? Before the angels standing around the King? or else before four or five barbarian slaves bought for a paltry sum? Before the Author of all nature, He who crowns? or else before a man passible like you, who in the hope of inheriting has by fear troubled and deceived by means of lying words, and who, as soon as you are dead and have finished in the tomb, scoffs at your folly, at the thought that at the price of how many fatigues and unprofitable labors you have gathered a quantity of goods, while he enjoys voluptuously those goods which were yours, while he thinks he is generous in tendering to the poor a coin for the rest of your soul?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Would to God that one only had to laugh at you! But now, since you have this conduct that merits tears, you will go clothed with the multiple passions of the love of riches, your soul tortured by force by the flesh, bound by the chains of the love of the body, you will go into the air, and you will walk on that other path where one meets herds of wretches who run after the stinking odor of the passions, in the manner of those carnivorous birds that circle above corpses. Afterwards, when in the midst of the darkness of those evil spirits, (your soul) will turn and wander, seeing in no way, like those blind it will walk, not on roads of light, but there where it pleases them to lead it, it will dwell in the feverish places that by its evil works it has prepared for itself, and it will await that last day, that one where, receiving its body, it will stand before Him who judges.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Then, with what eyes, tell me, will you see that judge—who does not judge according to persons—, Him whom you will not have fed, Him to whom you will not have given to drink, Him whom you will not have clothed, Him to whom you will have attributed nothing of your testament, as you (did) to those insolent, impertinent, and ungrateful people?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">While here below one prepares to engage a plea or a request (for grace), to do all that can appease the judge, to deploy every sort of defense and to gather (all) one's chances, you, when you make this last journey and go towards Christ, then, you will not even be able to touch those family goods which are His, to present them to Him, and you will have preferred blood and flesh to your Creator who for you became flesh and dwelt among us <sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup>. Of what must one marvel the more? Of the immensity of the madness and insolence, or else of a total lack of faith? Will you be like he who cannot repay the one who came to your aid?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Why do you not fear Him as judge? For if you believed these words relative to the judgment, you would not then have such a sentence of condemnation. You will therefore undergo the trial of the fire that is not quenched, which you did not fear, when you heard of it; you will suffer in yourself bitterly, when you are gnawed by that worm that does not die, of which the One who loves men (you) warned, so that, fearing it when you heard of it, you might be preserved from having to undergo it. But the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, you will undergo them, at the hour when weeping has become useless for those who are afflicted, when it is no longer time to repent.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Considering therefore these things, let us turn back on ourselves, judging that there is nothing more grave than our salvation, not entrusting to others the administration of our goods, but making of our last resources a broad account, truly serving ourselves and going to the judge provided with all sorts of goods. But if we still concern ourselves with riches when we are alive, and if we prefer to be separated from the most tried members (of Christ) rather than from these (riches), at the moment when we are about to leave them, even against our will, then therefore, then, let us purify ourselves to give to Christ the Lord a little of His own goods, so as not to fall totally outside the kingdom of heaven. May we all be worthy of it, by His charity and by His grace, to whom belongs glory, honor, and power, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and at all times, and for the ages of ages! Amen!</p>
