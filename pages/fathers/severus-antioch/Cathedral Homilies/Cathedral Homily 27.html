    <h1>Homily 27</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">On the Holy Martyr Leontius</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">It is to all the martyrs that we must offer homage expressed in words, because they have subjected the carnal spirit to the sovereign and reasonable intelligence of the soul, and because, through patience in suffering, they have shown that the thought which is in us is not enslaved, that it is without a master, and that it does not allow itself to be led by any constraint. But, among these martyrs, it is especially Leontius whom we must honor, he who, by the combat that is proper to him, has enhanced the glory of those who struggled before him in the combat; even now and, so to speak, at every hour, he clearly testifies by astonishing miracles and by signs that Christ, his master, is the true God. For he, that courageous fighter, or rather the ashes of that one, provides us with evident and authentic proofs of the resurrection, by granting many wonders and healings of every kind to those who touch them, or rather, by causing to reach, even to those who are far away and who implore the supplications of the martyr, as if by rays, the effects that are proper to him, through the grace of the Spirit that is deposited there.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For that martyrdom itself is the confirmation and foundation of the hope of the resurrection, the Book of Acts attests, expressing itself thus: <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> "And it was with great power that the Apostles of Our Lord Jesus bore witness to the resurrection, and truly a great grace was upon them all." But then, for the apostles, it was while they were still alive and breathing this air that they performed wonders and attested to the resurrection of the Emmanuel, which is the first fruits of the resurrection we hope for. But, for the flesh of Leontius, it is after having been buried and returned to the earth from which it was taken, and even before rising again and before taking back its soul, that it performs great marvels; it no longer allows the flesh henceforth that hope alone remains for it; for a hope that is seen is not hope; for what someone sees, why does he still hope for it? says the Apostle Paul.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus it is great for someone to suffer for Christ; and the more someone is overwhelmed with many and violent torments, the more he fills his own vessel with goods that have more weight than (human) glory. And just as, concerning plants, one can see that the branches of fruit trees which, by horticulturists, are introduced like grafted points and placed under the bark of a tree, cause the bud which once was without fruit to give birth to fruit, in the same way also, the stigmata of Christ produced by torments, once imprinted on the bodies of martyrs, render the dried bones and the dead and sterile ash capable of producing fruits of wonders, miracles, and healing.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is by similar scars that Leontius, the martyr clothed with Christ, adorned his body, scars which will sparkle on him on the day of the resurrection with even more brilliance than the stars. It is from them that he also brings forth for us all these fruits of healing – and similar ones! – by casting out demons, by renewing wounded bodies, by forestalling future misfortunes, by manifesting through visions and clear revelations what was unknown and hidden, by foretelling what must necessarily take place – and by this showing himself a physician always available and free, not only of bodies, but also of souls – by filling with a certain divine character those who enter the temple of his oratory, touching their spirits and making them live from the splendor of heavenly love. And I know many among the young men of Berytus, a friend of laughter, a student of Roman law, who went to find him to pray to him, and who suddenly cast from their intelligence the films of their worldly thoughts and preoccupations and, as if they had wiped and cleared them of these (films), were the object of a happy transformation and converted and devoted themselves to a life of asceticism and the monastic life; I myself also am one of them, I who was changed and seized by the miracles of the martyr.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is for this, as I have just said, that he is the physician both of bodies and of souls, because, in truth, he was patient in all bodily torments, without being able to be driven to the limit, and yet he regarded them all as of little importance, desiring with the impetus of his soul to receive the trial of torments more numerous than those, he who in truth, as I heard it said by one of those who had grown old in Tripoli who recounted these old (memories) and said of him that he had not been brought by force to the tribunal of the judge nor violently dragged, but that he had come there of his own accord, in a way voluntarily.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">When he saw indeed that the martyr Publius – who rests in his vicinity – was at that moment being led to death, he attached himself to him, accompanied him, spoke to him without fear, having in view only to learn, and shortly after he was fighting with him, struggling with him, even surpassing him for the crowns, advancing with fervor to suffer, in the same way that those who love their flesh advance in order not to suffer; and in all things he was poised, firm, immutable, justifying that divine word as if it had been said in advance concerning him: "The righteous is as bold as a lion."<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> And perhaps now, after him, it is better to say concerning those who are filled with ardor and who run hastily to a praiseworthy boldness: "The righteous is as bold as Leontius."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Being thus prepared and having descended with such ardor into the stadium of martyrdom, it was not he who was tested by the torments, but it was he himself who gave to the torments themselves his own test, so that they themselves might be tested in him, because he laughed at them all, without being vanquished by fear, and because he showed to those who then judged in a tyrannical manner that they needed other instruments of torture; as if those they had deserved the reproach of being vile and easily contemptible, he wove the crown of martyrdom, departing to his Master, all resplendent and exalted by the exploits of his courage.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">And immediately, on the spot, he won the benefits of the crowns for his labors; and it is by many and diverse healings that he has appeared as savior and helper for the living, he who seemed to be dead; and he shone with the rays of spiritual gifts, and there was no need for an orator to recount and repeat his martyrdom to those who (came) afterward and to adorn with words and exalt his virtuous actions; but it is he himself who, by his own miracles...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Such is the physician, indeed, that God truly had to raise up and produce in public for those who lived by the sea and in Phoenicia near Lebanon, so that by magnificent healings and miracles he might halt the course of pagan error and the cult of demons, and attract them all to himself.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Truly many were those who, running then to the Zeus of Baalbek in order to receive a false oracle, or having set out on the return journey, after having seen, even without understanding them, the wonders of the martyr, having received divine revelations and known thereby the truth, after having long derided the falsity of the oracle, left there the witness of their fathers. And many who wanted to devote themselves to legitimate unions, but who went to find the Lebanese Aphrodite, friend of evil desires, to celebrate an impure feast, and not the mystical one, and to inaugurate by debauchery a chaste union, having merited the attentive protection of the martyr and a nocturnal and fearsome vision, and having been struck by the doctrinal rod of purity, after having forgotten the follies of love, chose instead for themselves incorruptibility and passed to the great mystery of piety.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">And now the Zeus of the inhabitants of Baalbek has become mute and speechless, and is deprived of visitors, no longer leading into error except the inhabitants of Baalbek, because they wish it; and Aphrodite, the goddess of fornication and prostitution, weeps with tears over the chastity that has taken and exercises dominion over the universe, and, like the resemblance of adulterous debauched women who stand in a house of prostitution, she moans over her idleness and inaction. And it is to Leontius that all the earth and the sea send combatants and disciples of piety as to a doctor of virtue, as well as those who want to pray and show eagerness to render God propitious, as to the ambassador who has much power and enjoys great freedom with Christ; and all, obtaining what they ask, return to their country with joy and enthusiasm.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">For my part, I am in admiration for the way the martyr adapts to each one: to those who are perfect and have a word of wisdom,<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> as the Apostle says, how he appears to them in a perfect, reasonable, and wise manner, and makes known to them what is fitting; and to those who have a word of knowledge,<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> in a learned way and like one who reveals ineffable and hidden things; and to those who are average, in an average way; and to those who have imperfect dispositions, he condescends and amuses himself with wonders, as with very small children.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus one of the villagers who lived in the vicinity, according to the ancient pagan custom, had promised to offer a rooster to the martyr and was going to his oratory, when a soldier met him on the way: the latter took his rooster from him; and it was weeping and groaning that he went to that holy temple, in order to complain to him of this theft. Then, being inside, he lamented and spoke again of this violence. Before he had finished his words, the martyr punished the greedy belly of that soldier.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, after having slaughtered that rooster and put it in a pot, after having lit a fire and stirred it strongly, believing that the beloved and sought-after dish was cooked, and having set the table, he found that the meat of that rooster had hardened and become like a stone; and indeed it was not even susceptible to being broken into pieces with the hands, much less cut with the teeth. How, indeed, that which had become like stone?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">However, immediately the thief of the rooster became the herald of this wonder, and it was with him that the tears of that villager passed. Indeed, after having fallen on his face on the ground of the temple, he sighed bitterly, revealed his sin, and asked to obtain forgiveness for it. Seeing this, the one who had been wronged, standing, rejoiced that the martyr had accepted the iniquity and injustice that he himself had suffered, in place of a victim and all offering.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Another, who belonged to the same condition of villager, after having made a vow, had promised to the divine Leontius the first offspring of his cow. When the time of birth arrived and the little one came forth into the day, a temptation presented itself to the villager. Indeed, when he saw that the calf that was born had a good nature, and that it was white in color and of beautiful appearance, that it jumped and gamboled on the green grass of the fields and ran with its mother, superb and magnificent with its broad forehead and agile neck, that its horns were beginning...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">But immediately, all of a sudden, a white veil spread like scales over the eye of the magnificent and cherished calf: it was a reminder to warn the villager. When he realized his sin, he dragged the ox toward the temple of the martyr; and, as soon as he had advanced before the gates and tied it to one of the columns, immediately its eye was purified: indeed the thick veil that was on its pupil began to liquefy and come out drop by drop with tears. And, after the calf had been freed from its bonds, it went to join the other oxen of the martyr. For he also possesses herds from different origins, and great wealth both comes and proceeds from the wonders and healings that are performed there, because all well-off people reward the physician and author of wonders with many gifts and offerings. From there, one can see, around the martyrium, the guest house for strangers, for the care given to lepers and to those who have other illnesses of all sorts and all that is useful and good for them.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is also good for us not to pass over in silence this other feature. A poor man, indeed, who was pressed and importuned by an intransigent creditor for a sum of six gold denarii, asked the martyr in his prayer to pay this debt for him. And in a friendly manner – (the martyr) revealed to him at night, standing near him, to go to the city gate: as soon as he sees men of the country bringing jars of wine to the village, he should pick up a small stone from the ground and break the last of the jars. When he awoke, he was perplexed, fearing that besides the debt, he might also, due to the loss of wine that would occur, be accused and led to prison. However, he did what had been commanded. When the wine vessel was broken, the wine spilled on the ground and showed that a venomous reptile had been hidden beforehand in that jar. And he who bore this loss, which was thus full of profit and cause of salvation, according to the commandment of the martyr, put these six denarii into the hand that had picked up the stone and broken the jar.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I have said this for no other reason than to show, as I said before, that it is by wonders which (took place) concerning these matters of little importance that he brought near to him the pagans who lived around him and drew them away from the error of demons. For they were gaping in the face of these matters of little importance and visible, like very small children, while they made absolutely no account of the future and of what is invisible.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> That is also why one of their philosophers said: "The Greeks are always children, and there is no old Greek."<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> That is why they mock us, they who regard the cross of Christ as folly,<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> because we parade the dead bones of martyrs, as they themselves say. And we, mocking their lack of intelligence, even go so far as to glory in that of which they themselves mock without reason and in an insane manner. And indeed their life-giving action and the miracles that are operated through their intercession, we divulge and reveal them and, as concerning true and sure pledges of the resurrection we hope for, we hold a firm hand, correcting by the facts themselves the lack of faith of these people.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is with this grace that the faithful intimate of Christ and the valiant soldier Leontius has come to us in Daphne, not to accuse Apollo who was formerly honored there and to show him a lying diviner – for he was accused by another, his soldier, I mean the holy martyr Babylas,<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> after he was struck by lightning and burned with his temple and his idol – but to come to your aid, because he is above all the physician of souls. I know, indeed, that our fellow citizens frequently run to make an outing to Daphne as to a place of pleasure and amusement; and, because he wants to forestall the harm that is there for souls, he has occupied in advance the very entrance as the gate of that place, when he fixed there this holy temple.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, every passerby will enter and pray and come to the remembrance of the sufferings of the martyr, and he will anoint himself with the holy oil from his venerable urn; and, after having thus tamed the desires of the flesh, it is with a chaste and honest thought that he will go to the diversion, without going as far as fornication, nor toward shameful songs, nor toward obscene laughter. And, when he has filled himself with food and drink in a moderate and sufficient manner and with (the prayer of) blessing and has delighted rather spiritually, he will return home without being affected in his body or in his soul.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">He will procure for you another important advantage, considering that it is on the very summit of the road to Daphne that the temple of the martyr is found. Indeed, many poor people sit there permanently, and they remain a long time and they will block your path and they will not yield until they too have a part in a certain portion of the expense that you are going to make. And what price would one give to first nourish Christ, through the intermediary of those who are hungry, instead of sending everything to the ever-insatiable belly, whether it is filled or not?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, I omit to say that, in doing this, the grace of the martyr will be granted to you very abundantly and very widely, namely by signs and by wonders and by miracles; on the very day of yesterday, he began for us with his own wonders. For, while on the road, on the chariot that carried a venerable portion of his bones which was brought here, many were throwing garments of all sorts, breads, rings and necklaces, and were presenting very small children asking that they might have and receive their share of the blessing and holiness of the saint and that they might touch him, one of the children, fallen to the ground, found himself under the wheels of that chariot: everyone believed that he was dead and that his bones had been scattered to Sheol,<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> as the psalmist says. However, by the supplications of the martyr, while it was on the two thighs of the child that those wheels had passed, wheels which cannot even be borne by resistant and solid stones, they did not even mark with a line the so tender flesh of the child. Let us give thanks for this to Christ, the God of the universe who has given us such a chief and master of the city, and likewise also, a guardian, a physician, and a helper in our supplications. To him be praise throughout the ages! Amen!</p>
