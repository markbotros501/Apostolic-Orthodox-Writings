    <h1>Homily 4: On the Reading of Luke Before the Nativity</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>1.</strong> On the fact that, before the feast of the Nativity, the beginning of the Gospel of Luke is read according to custom; and, according to the verses of the gospel, on the dogma of the divine incarnation and the ethical teaching, that is, pertaining to the way of living, which teaches how we must prepare ourselves before the feast.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>2.</strong> Just as the light of day, at its rising, illuminates in advance the faces of those who look at it, and prepares them for the sight of the sun's splendor, lest, after darkness, eyes suddenly exposed to the rays should not bear its brightness, that the pupils be not blinded and the eyelids close and be deprived of the charm of light, so also, when the rising of the sun of justice<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> is about to shine upon us through the Nativity according to the flesh, and the day is at our gates, the ceremony of the feast ordains that on this day of the feast of the Nativity, we celebrate Christ our Savior by the evangelical trumpet of the readings which will now be made, to purify in advance the eyes of our spirit, so that, once prepared, we may receive the light of the coming of Christ in the flesh and consider by what words the divine Luke introduces us to the mysteries and prepares us for them.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>3.</strong> He says: "The eyewitness and ministerial word has been accomplished by those who were the spectators and servants of the Word."<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> What are you saying? Do you call the apostles spectators and servants of God the Word? How did they see, tell me, him who is without body and who falls not under sight? How? Because, except for sin<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>, he hypostatically united to himself flesh, he who is consubstantial with us, who had a soul endowed with reason and intelligence, (who was formed) of the Holy Spirit and of the Mother of God, ever-virgin Mary, who can in all ways be seen, be touched, and be measured. For this reason also Paul says that because he was manifested in the flesh, he was seen by angels<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>. Likewise also John, the (son) of thunder, exclaims in his letter: "That which was from the beginning, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled, of the Word of life."<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>4.</strong> If therefore this Word who was seen and touched is proclaimed because of this essential union with the body, (a union) which is without confusion and without division, and if in the same manner it is written that the Son of Man descended from heaven<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>, and that, when he became flesh from the Mother of God, the Virgin Mary, she who is consubstantial with us, how shall we not speak of one Emmanuel, who, from two natures, divinity and humanity, is united in an unbreakable union and is not known in two natures in their operations and properties? For if the two subsist still after the union, the union would therefore be torn apart by these (elements). For this (being), when from two it is reunited into one, does not confuse those of which it is the reunion, because it is united in an immutable way, and it remains one in a fixed manner, even when the duality after the union is denied.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>5.</strong> It is for this reason that the Word was seen and touched and, because he became flesh without change, it is what is corporeal in him that is seen and touched. His properties, he received them in himself to be inscribed therein. It is not because he was seen that he is; but it is because he became that he was seen. Now, because he became and was seen, for that also he suffered in the flesh<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>, bearing the cross for us, and he remained impassible in the sufferings.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>6.</strong> This is in no way like the impious Tome of Leo, who at the Council of Chalcedon affirmed: "Let us separate for each of the natures what is proper to it and let us say properly what each operates." For just as the Word, who cannot be touched or seen, was seen and touched, so also, he who heals, walked on the sea. Shall we therefore say that the proper operation is that he walks on the water? They will answer us, those who after the union introduce two natures, that it is the (nature) divine. But how would it be proper to the divinity to walk with corporeal feet, and not that of the (nature) human? And how is it not foreign to man to walk on a liquid surface<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>? Therefore it is time for you to seek a third nature, to whose account you will inscribe an operation of this kind. For from these two natures...</p>
