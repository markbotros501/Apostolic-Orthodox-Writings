    <h1>Homily XXIV: On the Ascension of Our Great God and Savior Jesus Christ<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> and on the Purple Mantle that was Given by Our Pious Emperor Anastasius</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Today Jesus Christ, he who is called the Son of Man, of Mary, of Bethlehem, of Nazareth, has ascended into heaven. O wonderful and sublime charity! For he ascended as a stranger and as a non-stranger, while he is found in the regions of the spiritual and incorporeal armies. A stranger on the one hand, because now, for the first time in his flesh, he sits upon his throne which surpasses that of kings and is above every principality. A non-stranger on the other hand, because, having become man without change for us, he had not left this seat nor heaven. But, as man, he associated with men<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, and as God, he fills the universe.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">If someone goes somewhere as a stranger, it is rightly said that he has ultimately gone to a place where he was not before; likewise (for Christ), while he filled the earth before the incarnation, it was said that he came to earth and his coming in the flesh was believed, as of someone who was outside of it; thus, now also, he went to heaven in his flesh, while he fills all things, and is contained by nothing. Such is the accomplishment of the mystery: to this end was directed the entire mystery of the economy, so that we, who did not even seem worthy of the earth, he himself in himself might elevate us and make us ascend to heaven.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why Paul, speaking of the love which God the Father has for us, wrote: he raised us up with him, and with him he made us sit in those regions beyond the heavens in Christ Jesus, to demonstrate in the ages to come the overflowing richness of his grace by his benevolence toward us in Christ Jesus<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">What mind broad enough can grasp by thought the greatness of this mystery, or what word can explain fittingly what is contemplated? For see this herald and apostle of the Gentiles: when he speaks of grace, of overflowing richness and of benevolence, and he gathers, so to speak, all the best expressions that can signify such charity, in the end, the poverty of terms leaves him destitute, he is overcome by the wonder, and he adds yet these words: This is not from yourselves, it is a gift of God<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>. Why insist so much, when by such a word, I wish to show that such an abundance of goodness in this gift is a gift of God, and consequently that it surpasses also all speech?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Who would not be astonished, indeed, to see this race of men, the one which had been driven from paradise, which submitted to the Slanderer, to appearances and to the passions of the flesh, which took wood and stones for gods, seated (now) on that throne above the kingdoms, by that power which is from among us, the incarnate and inhumaned God without change for us, this second Adam, this Only Son, this Word from before the ages, he who alone sits with the Father and the Holy Spirit, both before the incarnation and after the incarnation, but who, before the incarnation, is simple and not composite, being incorporeal, and, who after the incarnation, from two, from divinity and humanity, is one.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For the Word united himself hypostatically, by the Holy Spirit and by the Mother of God, Mary, a body consubstantial with us and which is like us in everything, except sin<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>, animated by a soul endowed with reason and intelligence. Thus he is still one (single) Son, not having rejected what he was, God, and having become man without confusion; and that is why he was called Emmanuel and he received this name so that it might be written that it signifies one hypostasis of two natures. If he is of one hypostasis, he is also of one "prosopon", and also of one incarnate nature of God the Word. Consequently, the adorable Trinity has not received any increase.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For he does not lie in any way, when he exclaims according to the prophet: I will not give my glory to another<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>. That is why also this One of the Trinity was crucified, in enduring the cross for us, while he is the Lord of glory<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For if after the union one divides the duality, he would of necessity have a human nature that is not adorable, because he would be united not naturally to him who by nature is adorable, and he would not be counted as making one with him who did not deem it a legitimate prize to be equal to God<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">He also, once risen from the dead, made us rise with him, we who had descended through sin, and he showed his hands and his feet<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> to his disciples, and the mark of the nails, and he offered himself to be touched by them, saying: Touch and see that a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see that I have<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>, thus shutting the mouth of those reckless and insolent ones who say: He is incarnate in imagination. For what is imaginary is it susceptible of being grasped or touched? And it is not in this alone that he suppressed their impiety in advance, but also in saying immediately afterwards to his disciples: Do you have something to eat? And as they presented him with a piece of grilled fish and a honeycomb, he took them and ate<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>. Now he did this only to show clearly that it was he who was risen from the dead, he who also before the cross and during all the time of the economy, had eaten and drunk with them and had associated with them<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> as a man, according to the word of the prophet.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But there is yet another sublime consideration: this act of eating a piece of grilled fish signifies the accomplishment of the economy, for the accomplishment of the economy is my redemption. Indeed, to our human nature plunged into the fluidity of the dissolute life like a fish, by the ineffable incarnation, was united the Word of God, this mystical and elusive fire, like that which grilled and reheated it, which extinguished in it the effusion of passions and accomplished this provision so usefully, as to make it his customary nourishment.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For the salvation of men is to be nourished by God, and he showed it clearly in the Gospels; once, his disciples urging him to eat, while he was going to speak to that Samaritan woman, while he foresaw her salvation thanks to (her) faith, he said: For me, I have food to eat which you do not know, and my food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now, with grilled fish, he also ate a honeycomb, wishing to say that those who have been burned by the divine incarnation and made participants of his divinity, like honey, accept his commandments with passion, in order to write, in them his laws as on wax<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is in accomplishing these mysteries and others like them that he who rose from among the dead, after having been wounded in the side by the lance<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>, and in his hands and feet by the nails, ascended to heaven, bearing the signs of victory and triumph over death, which manifested to the powers above why this voluntary dead, this living dead, he who was in corruption and outside of corruption, had become incarnate. For it was a body susceptible to corruption, but belonging to him who by nature is incorruptible and who cannot be enclosed by sin. And when he tasted death, he did not see corruption, this (being) terrestrial and celestial, this scarlet which became red by blood and which shines, all resplendent with the rays of his divinity.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why the intellectual spirits, seeing him, according to the prophet Isaiah, exclaimed: Who is this who comes from Edom—that which (comes) from Bozrah is wrapped in earth—from Bozrah in scarlet garments, so beautiful in his tunic<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>? Now this word Bozrah, when it is translated from Hebrew into the Greek language, means "of flesh"; there are even cases where the garment has the name of flesh, and it is when this (flesh) is united to us by nature, as Job showed by saying: He has clothed me with skin<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> and flesh; he has woven me with bones and sinews. This is what they say: from the earth we see him coming, but red at once and splendid: red like blood, splendid with a splendor surpassing that of men, as David says: For in beauty worthy of divinity he has nothing comparable<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>, when, in that glory which is above all, he exalts the flesh in a manner worthy of God.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">This is what Paul was saying, seeing the armies of heaven learn and have the revelation of the economy concerning us: How was it as now to the Principalities and the Powers, in the heavenly places, through the Church, the wisdom of God, with its manifold resources, in the conduct of the worlds, which he realized in Christ Jesus our Lord<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>. Afterwards, this impassible being bore in himself the signs of suffering, because he became incarnate and was adorned, in coming among these angelic and celestial spirits, glorifying himself with the salvation of men and with having recovered those who were lost.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But we, shall we not set our minds on things above, and shall we not remove our spirit from the earth? Shall we not fly with the wing of the spirit to lift ourselves toward this royal throne, the one upon which we sit with the Father, thanks to the firstfruits of our race, namely Christ? Shall we not accomplish the actions that befit heaven, by him in whose dwelling we shall be transferred?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">When the rage of lust or of avarice or of one of these other passions pricks you, say to it: I am ashamed (at the thought) of my firstfruits who sit up there, I fear this honor to which I am elevated and I dread taking thus a provision for an even greater torment and impossible to reject: immediately on the spot, the passion will flee, the boat of your spirit will receive the calm of impassibility and the Lord of justice will then reign in our members, instead of sin, and we will let fall all that comes from us and we will give these (members) purified to their Lord<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For behold that our pious and true friend of Christ, our emperor, makes an offering to him of his purple and his imperial mantle. For us, it is a symbol of the good actions that we have to do, and, with regard to Him who gave him the empire, it is a recompense of honor inspired by his pious sentiments. He thus resembles those who spread and laid their garments under his (feet) on the road, when, on the foal of a donkey, in a divine manner at the same time as according to the economy, he was carried in triumph with palm branches, honored and accompanied by the crowd that came to meet him and followed him.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">In confessing today with the armies above, that he is the king of glory, he by whom kings reign and the powerful write justice<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>, he fixes his gaze on this elevated and inaccessible (being) who for us voluntarily humbled himself, who teaches and learns humility and patience of the spirit. He considers him as the cause of good actions, by the fact of having, laboring with him and having at the same time acquired such virtues, she who, for us, is co-sovereign with him and his spouse; so that those under their authority admire and praise Him who through marriage unites pious souls as well as bodies, and say that in truth one can justly invoke concerning them that sacred word: It is thanks to the Lord that the woman suits the man<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For all collaboration and marriage come from God, and there is nothing outside his Providence. But that there be harmony and agreement between this woman and her husband, that is a divine gift, which is granted only to a few, and only to those who live in virtue, a gift which is increased by his grace and by his strength. For which, indeed, among the empresses, has lived in such a way that she has been a burden to none of her subjects with regard to feminine passions, and has not made her subordinates pay the tribute of her personal pleasures, but has despised these things with a virile heart and avoided even above all that one think she is a woman? And with very good reason. For previously the women who were bound to the emperors by marriage were strangers, who surpassed men in imperial honor, and, without having experience of the good, enjoyed the lifestyle of this world and had total license for their passions.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But this one, being born of a pious emperor, having grown, matured, and lived in an imperial dwelling, now lives with a husband who loves God, and who is more emperor by the spirit. This luxury of empire, she judges that she must despise its tyranny and not be caught by the visible things to be desired at all costs, but she knows how to dominate them by scorning them all.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That is why the universal Savior has honored her kingdom and that of the pious emperor, even in this life, with the delights of heaven, by crowning their community of thoughts and the orthodoxy of their faith, which thus prepares them for the kingdom of the heavens. May we all merit that this be realized, by the grace and charity of our Savior Jesus Christ, to whom be glory with the Father and with the most holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and at all times and for the ages of ages! Amen!</p>
