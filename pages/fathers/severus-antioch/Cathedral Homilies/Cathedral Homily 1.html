    <h1>Homily 1: On Himself</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">After he was, from the beginning, promoted and came to the pontificate and apostolic see of the Church of the Antiochians. And that we must confess Christ of two natures as one Lord, one Son, and not two natures after the ineffable union. And against the atheistic opinion of Eutyches. And it was delivered in the martyrium of the holy martyr Romanos.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">1 This is the first homily that Saint Severus delivered after he had been ordained archbishop of the Church of the city of Antioch; and which he delivered once again, two days later, in the sanctuary of the holy martyr Romanos, at the request of a great number of people who had not been able to hear because of the tumult and the cries of the numerous crowd that had gathered on the day he was ordained, the 21st of the month of Choiak, at the time of the 6th year of the cycle.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">2 Long ago, after having departed for Mesopotamia, the patriarch Jacob, admirable for his virtues, having gone part of the way, (...) evening (...): for the fatigue of the journey invited him to it. Having fallen asleep, in a vision he saw a great ladder rising up to heaven; its foot rested on the earth, while its head reached heaven. And the Lord was leaning upon the top, as the holy Scripture has said<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">3 Now the blessed Jacob, after having been deemed worthy of this vision and having profited from this great grace, understood through this revelation the mystery full of wonders that had been prefigured from the beginning.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">4 He took a stone, placed it as a stele for honor — for it was holy<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> — and for the glory of God who had explained the vision to him; he did not stop there only, but he poured oil on the stone. Then he spoke thus: "This is the house of God and this is the gate of heaven"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">5 With such words, it is just as if he exclaims: When will the sun of righteousness<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>, the Word of God the Father, the chosen and precious cornerstone, according to the word of Isaiah<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>, he who was anointed with the oil of gladness above his companions<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>, and who humbled himself and became incarnate<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> for us, shine upon the inhabitants of the earth? Then he will be for us a ladder; and he will bring us up to heaven, we who lie on the earth through the sin of Adam's transgression<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>; he will be for us the gate of heaven.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">6 He will reveal to us the glory of his Father, and show himself to us with the Holy Spirit, he will teach us the one Lordship and the one Divinity in the Holy Trinity leaning upon the ladder, which is our Savior Jesus Christ, he through whom those in heaven are united with those who are on the earth<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">7 That is why Our Lord himself says in the Gospel to Nathanael: "Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man"<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>. And again, in another passage, he says: "I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture"<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">8 And now, I, a sinful wretch, do not know the plan that was formed concerning me by the foreknowledge and wisdom of God surpassing all thought, until I was placed beyond my merits upon this sacred chair. And behold, now I contemplate this great church full of people, boiling over through the Spirit and resplendent on all sides by the rays of the light of the orthodox faith; it is the moment for me to remind you of the words of the patriarch Jacob, and to say: "This is the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven"<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">9 This is the spiritual flock that Peter, the greatest of the apostles, shepherded by nourishing it with the holy dogmas of the religion. This is the stone upon which Christ, God of the whole universe, established the foundation of the Church which is in every place<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">10 This is the people upon whom the holy name of Christ was written, and who before all others were called Christians<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>: a new name that will be blessed on the earth, and which Isaiah the prophet indicated in advance<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>. But this city, friend of Christ, which bears every kind of spiritual grace, was troubled by the storm of impiety, which was first stirred up by Diodore and by Theodore, the leaders of the impure heresy produced by the spirits of perversity; which was excited even more by their disciple of the same type, Nestorius, when he was blinded like them by the flash of the devil's madness.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">11 After him, the synod that gathered at Chalcedon excited it still higher, in the manner of the sea when it is agitated by a great storm, when it becomes wilder and raises its waves very high. This synode, indeed, if in a certain way it applied a remedy to the evil heresy of Eutyches, on the other hand introduced into the Church the soul-destroying madness of Nestorius; and undertaking to heal evil with evil, according to the expression of the proverb<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>, it became the cause of a great sickness for the body of Christ which is the Church, and not of salvation.</p>
    </div>

        <p class="paragraph">12 For the only-begotten Son, the Word of God, he who became incarnate and was made man for us, without change or transformation, (the synod) divided him into two natures after the ineffable and incomprehensible union, speaking wrongly as if it were a man who suffered death and the cross, and not the Lord of glory whom they crucified<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>, after having suffered for us in the flesh truly, though he is incomprehensible God and impassible in his nature. For if the immortal Word of God the Father had not become one in hypostasis with the mortal, I mean the body of the same essence as ours which contains an intelligent soul, there was no way that death could touch him in his entirety.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">13 But having become flesh and man, and having continued also to be God without change, he, this same Word of God, tasted death for us, after he became flesh for us; and he continued to be immortal, because he is immortal according to his nature. Therefore, he who first confesses with an upright heart, a firm mind, and an immutable faith that the Word of God became flesh in a flesh of the same essence as ours, in the manner I spoke of above, will also confess that the same is truly God and man; he will attribute to the same individual the sufferings and the wonders that befit divinity and humanity, the cross, the tomb, the resurrection, and immortality. And death will not at all change the conditions of immortality, since the immortal by his nature made that which was ordinarily mortal, that is, the flesh in which he suffered and died for us, become the same (being) as himself.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">14 Let us flee now, O people, friend of Christ, the madness of the new Jews, that is, of those who assembled at the synod of Chalcedon, who divided this indivisible one into two natures; seeking according to the Tome of Leo the blasphemer which nature was nailed to the wood of the cross, so that by attributing passibility to the nature of humanity alone, they might not attribute it to the Lord of glory<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>, our Savior, the Word of the Father, and in this way they divide the indivisible into two natures: for this word "two" dissolves the unity; and the whole theme of the Economy of our salvation, they completely destroy it. Yes, ideas of impiety such as this, let us flee far from them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">15 Let us confess one Lord of glory<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>, that is, the Emmanuel, one person, one hypostasis, one incarnate nature of God the Word, according to the formula transmitted to us by our holy inspired Fathers; and let us in no way endure praying with those who dare to separate (from the Divinity) the flesh of our Savior, with two natures after the ineffable and incomprehensible union, thinking thus to honor the divinity.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">16 As the rebel Eutyches said and other heretics who raved with him in the same madness, saying that it is not fitting for us to lower the divinity to a generation according to the flesh, they did not recognize, the senseless ones, that his birth, being from a Virgin, does not come from male seed, but from the Holy Spirit.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">17 And finding a pretext in sins, insinuating that it would be a shameful thing if God endured the generation full of impurity of our poor nature, they said that he appeared in fantasy; they did not know, these wretches, that where God is with impeccability, there is all purity and all holiness, for the stain of impurity is nothing other than the defilement coming from sin.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">18 Furthermore, straying into such vain thoughts, they dared to say that God the Word did not become flesh in truth; but they said that he took on the appearance of a man, that he left his dwelling to enter into this world, in a kind of vision seen in the imagination of sleep; so that finally they made the Economy of our salvation a kind of baseless dream.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">19 This is truly a great and grave sin; and those who maintain such blasphemies differ in nothing from the Jews who crucified the Lord. For, if it is as they say, then truly our preaching is vain, vain is our faith<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>, and we are like the hungry who eat in a dream, and who upon waking see that their dream is a vanity; or like one who is thirsty and drinks in a dream, and who upon waking is still thirsty, while his soul hoped for vanity<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">20 The prophet Isaiah magnificently announced in advance the error of those who have gone astray in this way with such words. For if the Word of the Father did not have in common with us the same essence, by taking the seed of Abraham<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> and becoming man truly, how shall we be called sons of God<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>? For if the Emmanuel had not taken our flesh, we would not have received the spirit of adoption<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>; if he had not emptied himself by his own will, by making himself poor for us, from being rich as he was, according to the testimony of the Apostle<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>, we all would not have received from his fullness life and grace<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>, as the holy evangelist, John the Theologian, said.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">21 But avoiding ourselves such expressions full of atheism from both parties, I mean from those Nestorians who are the dyophysites, and from the Eutychians, let us confess that the Emmanuel is one, that he is God the Word of the Father, who became man through his love for mankind; that it is not at all possible to conceive of two natures after the indissoluble union, but "one incarnate nature of God the Word"<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>, that is to say, who became man while remaining God also. Because, on the one hand, he took flesh from the Virgin Mary of the same essence as us, we confess this without any hesitation. And, on the other hand, since the flesh he took became one with the Word of the Father, for this we say that he is one, the Son of God, and that there is one nature of God the Word incarnate.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">22 And this expression "He became flesh"<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup> shows manifestly this fact: that it is not simply by conjunction that the divinity was united to the flesh, but that it is according to hypostasis that it became one with it; so that those who dare to separate into two natures the Word of God from the flesh after the union, no longer believe in a Trinity, but it is a Tetrad that they confess.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">23 But we, my brothers, let us stand firm on the unshakable rock of the holy apostles, having secured ourselves by it on all sides; without being carried away by the deceitful words of the heretics, but believing and knowing in truth that Christ, the Son of the living God, suffered for us in the flesh<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>; let us retain the words of the great apostle Peter as an inheritance from our fathers, for, truly, they block the way of all impiety. For one is God the Christ, born of the Mother of God, the Virgin Mary; he is the living Word and the wisdom of the Father, he is one and in no way divided into two natures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">24 It is for this reason that the blessed Peter deemed it necessary to preach to all the orthodox dogma of the religion, saying that Christ suffered for us in the flesh<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>, thus designating one person and one hypostasis of God the Word incarnate.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">25 For, if he is divided into two natures, then it is superfluous, or rather, it is a great folly to say: "He who was able to suffer suffered for us in the flesh"; but since he is God impassible by nature, having become man without change and able to suffer for us, for this reason, he (Peter) proclaimed to us: "Christ suffered for us in the flesh"<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>. As if we had been worthy, then, of this great love for mankind on the part of Our Lord Jesus Christ our Savior, let us purify ourselves each day from the stain of our sins and mortify the members that are on the earth: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire which is idolatry<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>, according to the teaching of the apostle; for in this way we shall prepare ourselves to speak the holy language of God. But let us not pour choice perfume on foul-smelling mud.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">26 For what is the advantage of one who speaks with the sublime dogmas of the religion, and who does not first purify his tongue from lying and slander, or from hypocrisy and deceit? As a wise man said, "A blessing is not beautiful in the mouth of a sinner"<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">27 The blessed James also said: "Just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead itself"<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>. A similar thing is expressed thus: "Just as a dead man, even if he still has his head on him, can perform no action, nor speak, nor walk, so also, if a righteous life is not joined to faith, that faith is dead and without effect"<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">28 For if the words of Our Lord burn like fire, as God said through Jeremiah: "My words are like a burning fire"<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>, then he who must speak with the dogmas and sentences of Scripture also needs a tongue burning like fire. It is for this very reason that the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles in the appearance of tongues that dispersed like fire<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">29 It is also with a similar tongue that the holy martyr Saint Romanos, in whose name we are celebrating today, made use of in that famous defense which he pronounced before the judge. The latter having said to him: "It is right to obey the Sovereign," the hero replied to him: "It is right to obey God, sovereign of the universe, rather than the Sovereign"<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup>, and he continued to repeat such words until they took away his tongue.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">After having kindled their fire with a great quantity of wood, the executioners thought to burn the holy body, but the Lord of the universe glorified his martyr, for, at that instant, he caused a great rain to fall, extinguished the fire and kept the body of his servant unburned.</p>
    </div>

        <p class="paragraph">30 And we also, my brothers, let us give glory to Him who became flesh for us, by mortifying the thoughts of the flesh that are enemies of the Spirit<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup>; let us give glory to the Word of the Father by restraining the untamable impulse of senseless passions through continence.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">31 Let us give glory to the Merciful One by becoming ourselves merciful towards those who have the same nature as us. Let us give glory to the friend of mankind, by not being bound in our heart towards him who has become our enemy. Let us give glory to Him who suffered for us, by disposing ourselves also to suffer for his name.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">32 Let us give glory to Him who dwells in the heavens and who came upon the earth for us, who has again ascended to the heavens, who fills all places and governs them all, by abandoning the cares of the earth, by occupying ourselves with the things of heaven, seeking the things of heaven, where Christ dwells, seated at the right hand of the Father<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup>. There is our true homeland, from which we fell, which has been restored to us by grace through the love for mankind of Our Lord, who became man for us, even to restoring us to our former dignity. Certainly all the works of this life differ in nothing from dreams or shadows that deceive those who are in pleasure as well as those who are in the theater.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">33 Let us pass therefore beyond all this and pursue the things of heaven with eagerness, like those who run in the stadium, before all this passes beyond us, for the form of this world is passing away<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup>, according to the word of Paul.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">34 Let us not believe we have done a great thing if we despise the things that pass away; but let us hasten to enter the eternal kingdom of the heavens! May it come to pass that we all obtain it!</p>

        <p class="paragraph">35 By the grace and love for mankind of Our Lord and our God, our Savior Jesus Christ, to whom be glory with his good Father, with the life-giving and consubstantial Holy Spirit, now and at all times for all the ages of ages! Amen!</p>
