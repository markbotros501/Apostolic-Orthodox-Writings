    <h1>Homily 26</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">A WARNING ON THE SPECTACLE OF THE HORSES, the first which took place after spring, so that we might flee a harmful diversion as well as the evils which result from it, and on the holy martyr Theodore.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Just as a good father, seeing his son show constant application in one of his studies and in the trade he is learning, is content, delighted in his heart and proud of the good nature of his son, so too I, seeing this church and this holy assembly have an eager application to hear the divine words and – what follows from it – to know and learn the virtues, I rejoice greatly within myself and I give thanks to God, who supplies the defect of my tongue by your intelligent hearing.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For there was once in Jerusalem, when it abounded in spiritual virtues, as the prophet Isaiah says, a wise architect and an intelligent hearer. Let the wise architect be the teacher of the divine dogmas, as the wise Paul teaches: “For it is,” he says, “according to the grace of God given to me, that I, as a wise architect, have laid the foundation.”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Of the wisdom of the visible Jerusalem, which has the same name, in truth I will not speak, given that I am far from it, (but) I appear to be an architect, because of the richness of your wise hearing, and what you have in excess has supplied what I lack; for it is again fitting that I use once more the words of Paul.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But then above all will I praise your intelligence, when I find that you make use of the spiritual teachings as is fitting for the time of their realization, as well as the aids which are in advance a preventive of illness to avoid harm or to accomplish perfection. For a soldier, certainly, is also worthy of praise, when he is splendidly adorned with all his arms, when he brandishes javelins and knows how to shoot arrows and overturn shields. But this praiseworthy practice is absolutely of no advantage if, on the battle line, when the adversaries stand face to face, he shows nothing of what makes a warrior or a brave man, but if, fleeing, he is taken prisoner, according to what is said in the Psalm: “The sons of Ephraim who drew the bow and shot (arrows) turned back on the day of battle.”<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Why have I said this? I will say it clearly, and I will not hide it in any way. Since I set foot in this city until this day, I have found that you amass great spiritual riches, that you confirm your name which you have well deserved, to be called Christians first<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>, and that you show in reality and by the very facts the apostolic ordinances which are proclaimed in words in the church: on the one hand, that you love without partiality<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, and, on the other hand, that you hate evil, according to the word of Paul, that you are attached to the good, that you strive to show the love of brotherly charity one to another, that in zeal you are not negligent, that you are fervent in spirit, that you serve the Lord, that you rejoice in hope, that you are steadfast in tribulation<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>, that you have celebrated all the feasts of Christ with faith, purity, and honor, that on the one hand you have been reborn in a way with the birth of the Emmanuel according to the flesh, because you are preoccupied with walking in newness of life<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>, and that on the other hand you have risen with the divine rising and that you appear as lights in the world, holding the word of life<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>, so that it is revealed, even before the second glorious coming and before the great day, the God who stands in the assembly of the gods, he who says: “I said, ‘You are gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High.’”<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> That you have been crucified with the Crucified One and have crucified the spirit of the flesh<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>, that you have been put to death with him by burial and have put to death the earthly members, fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>, that you have been raised with him by resurrection, that you think on things above, that you seek the things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of the Father<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>, that you have been set on fire by the coming of the Holy Spirit, that you have turned your faces from the mud, that you have flown by the spiritual gifts, that you have, by the desire for the possession of these goods, fixed the eye of your spirit on heaven, and that you have shown eagerness for the stadium of fasting, or rather that you do not regard it as a stadium, but as a smiling meadow all in flower and a blessed dwelling in paradise.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">When, therefore, I saw now in you, as I have said, all this spiritual wealth, I feared that a misfortune might befall you. And indeed I had in view the spectacle of the horse races, the first which was to take place, and I was filled with disquiet and trouble in my thoughts, and I was terribly afraid that the demon, that evil one, might cause the loss of some among you by deceiving them with an ephemeral diversion and that he might make spectators of a Satanic pomp those who have deserved to see the divine invisible and ineffable mysteries, which many prophets and righteous men desired to see and did not see<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>, according to the true expression of Our Lord in the Gospels; which the angels also delight to contemplate with the desire of a more perfect understanding, as Peter, the chosen of the apostles, has written.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> And I weep much and groan, wondering in my spirit if the mouth which in church has raised mystical praises and invokes his Father who is in heaven has let slip on the occasion of the spectacles demonic words. And, to omit other (words) where there is much infamy and blasphemy, how much do you think it irritates God, this very word which seems despicable, which many cry without reflection, namely: “Fortune of the city, give victory!”<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> Those, indeed, who easily forge and invent these beings who are not gods, and who adore them – which, among what is done by men, is unworthy, without foundation and without value – when they have attributed it to a demon, according to what came to their mind, because in truth they did not understand it, they have called that “Fortune,” because what happens thus arrives by chance, and, while doing only this good and letting it be believed by this designation that it is not a divinity, yet, by that very fact, they reduce to nothing the Providence of God.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">First, indeed, the judgments of him who governs this universe are difficult to discern, and we do not know them, according to the word which says: “Your judgments are a great deep,”<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> and in another passage again: “His judgments are unsearchable and his ways inscrutable. For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor? Or who has given to him first, and by whom will he be repaid? For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever! Amen!”<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Then even that which among the events of this world appears an exception and is inclined to change, belongs to the supreme wisdom of God, who rules the universe. For by this he teaches us to despise what is present as being without foundation and not to attach ourselves to corruptible and temporary things, but to look to what is to come, incorruptible and immortal, as well as the last judgment where are placed the weights and scales of justice and the retribution, according to what is just for each one, concerning what has happened here below.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Why then, you, in your blindness, do you call Fortune such a wise government of God, and, by your own authority, make it a person, and erect your opinion as a god over the city, and attribute victory to it, when our God and our savior Jesus Christ cries out in the Gospels: “Take heart; I have overcome the world,”<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> he who also through the prophet Isaiah blames those who are sick with a similar vain opinion<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>, saying: “You who have abandoned and forgotten my holy mountain, and who prepare a table for Fortune and who fill a cup for the demon, I will deliver you to the sword, you will all fall by slaughter.”<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Do you see that praising Fortune sows polytheistic and idolatrous error? For if God who does not lie has decreed in the sacred Book of the Gospels, saying: “Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them falls to the ground without your Father,”<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> how, according to the foolishness of these wisdomless wise men, shall we say: “Fortune is the mistress of what exists?”</p>

        <p class="paragraph">If then, this single expression – even if, for many it does not seem condemnable – has after examination appeared subject to the condemnation of all reproaches of this kind, what shall we say of these other expressions that are shouted by those who watch the horse race, when they cry out with force and make their voices resound above the air by vociferating, when they throw dust toward the sky or on occasion even throw stones, when they bring forth from their mouths a foam of madness, when they imagine themselves running with the horses, handling the reins with the charioteer, striking at the same time as him with the whips, howling about the race and rejoicing when the adversary’s horses are exhausted, without hearing the Sacred Books say: “The righteous man has pity on the souls of his beasts,”<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> but on the contrary quarreling and saying: “There is absolutely no sin in diverting oneself with such spectacles.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">For my part, first of all, I will omit saying that every spectacle, whatever it may be, is celebrated in honor of a demon, for the pagans are rich in a harmful wealth, I mean a great number of false gods; one is for them a demon friend of horses, and another friend of laughter; this one, friend of war, and that one, the demon of hunting; and (the pagans) honor these (gods) by processions and feasts which they love, celebrating these in an impious manner, and conducting themselves in an atheistic way.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Next, let us grant that no adoration of demons takes place in the spectacle of horse races and that what happens is only the joy and diversion of the soul. Do you believe that this rejoices the God of the universe, he who, just as he has commanded the donkey to bear a burden, the ox to pull the yoke, the one who is yoked to the plow to cut the furrow, and the other beasts to serve the needs of the world, so also has given speed to the horse, in order to serve, so that we might make distant journeys quickly, that we might communicate useful information to those who are outside the borders, that we might perhaps prevent a harm and that we might go out in ranks for battle against the enemies who march upon us, as the Sacred Book also says somewhere: “The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but the victory belongs to the Lord.”<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> But it is not so that we might use the animal for excessive races, to make it sometimes turn round upon itself, to make it perish, or to break its legs, making it turn without pity, while you, when you give your horse to someone outside your home for him to use it, you bear it with difficulty and you consider that you have suffered wrongs, if he employs it at a mill or in a mine or at another laborious work; and you think that God does not bear it with difficulty and that he is not irritated when, outside of necessary causes and outside of his commandments, he sees you making use of the animals without pity! For the mercy of man, says a wise man, is for his neighbor, but the mercy of the Lord is for all flesh.<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, I omit saying that the expenses of this useless spectacle could fill the belly of many poor people and that he who knows how to do good and does not do it, commits a sin<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>, as James has written. And let no one give an opposing answer against me, saying: Behold, the Apostle Paul also says: “Is it for oxen that God is concerned?”<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup> For he is concerned even with these and he is also preoccupied with the irrational nature. It is he, indeed, who opens his hand and fills every animal with his benevolence.<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">However, behold, concerning what was said previously, what the Apostle himself said; for, when he was speaking to the Corinthians about the fact that those who proclaim the Gospel should be able to live from the Gospel<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>, to establish this, he cited the Book of the Law, which says: “You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain,”<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>; and thus he himself added afterwards: “Is it for oxen that God is concerned? Or does he not speak entirely for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written, because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of a share in the crop.”<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">But this is what he (means) to say: God, he says, said: “You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain,”<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup> not that by this he has some concern for oxen, which can fill their own belly, even if it were not on the threshing floor, while nevertheless accomplishing their work, but because he raises us to what is more important and to the thought which relates to men, and he shows us that it is worthy and just that he who does work should be nourished from his work, according to the commandment which says: “The laborer deserves his food.”<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">But, if you wish, let us even grant that rivalry for the horses is exempt from all sin. Why is it not in silence and sitting with propriety that you enjoy the spectacle? But why do you make it a cause of dispute and agitation? And why, puffing up, as if from a victory over perfection, about the fast running of the horses, do you irritate and provoke, by expressions of defiance, the one who is separated from you because of an opposite preference, so that, when he can no longer bear the blame, he turns to throwing and casting stones and from there audacity causes many murders to be committed?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">How shall one not rightly call this the games of very small children, and would to heaven it were only that!</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For I cannot say of whom I will mock more, from the point of view of lack of intelligence, the one who defies and irritates, or the one who is needlessly irritated and cursed for that which has nothing beautiful. They ought, indeed, as I judge, in general to praise those who are victorious, namely the horses and the charioteers and in general to reproach those who are vanquished, and not to be divided by a division of opinion and by partisanship and not to make of this a cause of agitation and general evils for all the people.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">But why wish, as if I were mistaken myself, to put order into disorder and to subject lack of reason to reason? For the fact that shouts, tumults, brawls, and agitations take place there shows above all that such (particularities) of spectacles are the work of demons; for it is by its fruits that the tree is known<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>, according to the true expression of Our Lord. Let the spectators of these (races) show the opposite and in a beautiful silence, let them be sated with this diversion! For my part, I pray to be proven a liar in this respect for the sake of their salvation. For, even if, concerning one spectacle or two, they can escape the harm (caused by) the Slanderer, for my part, I am very calm that most of the time they will come to disputes and troubles.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Let this, then, be said concerning those people! As for you who are assiduous in church, I warn you and I advise you not to soil your eyes with a spectacle of this kind, nor to dirty your tongue with abominable and foul expressions, that (tongue) which you have sanctified by singing and raising mystical prayers. But obey the holy Apostle who legislates and says: “And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of salvation,”<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup> and (who) teaches how we can not grieve the Holy Spirit and (who) adds then these words: “Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.”<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup> Now it is impossible that he be exempt from all this, he who watches the spectacle of the horses.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">May he deliver us all from it, he who delivered us from our snares<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>, as the psalmist says, and who redeemed us from sin, after we had been enslaved by the Slanderer, and had fallen into the snare of death, by his blood which purified the world, and who today has again called and gathered us so that we might celebrate the memory of the holy martyr Theodore, wishing to drown yesterday’s harm by today’s profit. For it is his habit to hide sicknesses under an abundance of healing and to compensate for our sins by his pardons, so that we may not escape noticing that what loses us is that by which we anger him.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">For to what thought does the martyr Theodore not bring us back, or from what spectacle of Satan does he not turn us away? And he attracts the eyes toward himself, for the spectacle is truly spiritual and heavenly, because it rejoices and delights the already rejoicing command of the angelic choirs, as well as the agonothete, Christ himself: spectacle of a man, a soldier, who stood in the midst of those judging, in the midst of those striking and in the midst of those watching, without trembling and without fear, confident without being troubled, a youth in age, whose down was just appearing and who had only a nascent beard, very black and thick like his hair, whose face had not been damaged by the razor because of his ascetic life, healthy and of fine stature, who, for the leaders of the army battalions, was an esteemed and renowned soldier, who reduced his body by works of endurance and shone by the clarity of his face, who had been enrolled to fight and to struggle against the barbarians and who had to fight not against blood and flesh, but against the principalities, the powers, and the rulers of this world of darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil.<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Like a statue, he stood upright in the stadium of martyrdom, while he was torn by blows and by torments of every kind without yielding and without weakening; for it is out of regard for his courage, his eagerness, and his preparation for dangers for Christ that the flame of fire also showed itself benevolent, and, after taking the form of a small round, circular house, similar to a cave, it enclosed his body in it, surrounded it externally and preserved it from destruction, and sent his soul toward the heavenly spirits.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Looking upon us from (on high), with joy he raises to the God of the universe the requests which are made for us, while he is the helper and free messenger of our supplications and the companion of the cares of our life, casting upon the demons a terrible and altogether unbearable look, restraining the feet of fleeing servants and thieves, bringing into full light the nocturnal and secret enterprises of those who steal clothes and break into houses, unveiling the guilty, and bringing them all near him as if chained, while he has perhaps received from Christ this honor because joyfully he accepted the bonds which were (destined) for him, when he was advancing toward the flame. These (bonds) he also showed to be superfluous, when he bound himself by the voluntary bonds of patience; for the fact that someone will judge it good to suffer for Christ is an indissoluble and indivisible bond, because in truth it is something voluntary; for there is nothing which is stronger and more solid than a virile thought.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Could yesterday’s spectacle rejoice and delight us as much? Have you not been nourished and charmed in your souls and have you not become better by the mere hearing? Or is there indeed a relation between the delights of the flesh and the deceiving spectacle of the eyes and the pleasure of the soul and the spiritual contemplation? There is a great distance between the two, as great as that between moderation and excess in thoughts?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For you too, oppose to immoderate laughter the tears of the soul’s repentance; to laxity, energy; to gluttony, sufficient nourishment, which satisfies need and not superfluity; to the puerile street songs which one necessarily blushes at when one pays sustained attention to them, the songs (in use) in church, and, in the face of all, a blameless conscience, the hope which does not disappoint<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>, which is close to faith, (which) is firmly awaited and (which) is future. Let someone judge, upon reflection, if there is anything happier than to appease God? Let us also raise to him the thanksgiving for all things, because to him belongs praise, glory, and power, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen!</p>
