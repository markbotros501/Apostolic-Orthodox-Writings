    <h1>Homily 6: On the Boundary of the Ascetic Life</h1>
   
                <p class="paragraph">From Homily 6: The boundary of this ascetic life is the meditation on death and the departure of the soul from the body.</p>
        
               <p class="paragraph">From Homily 6: Nothing purifies the spirit as much as the fear of an endless torment that is decreed. Indeed, through fear we are restrained and we distance ourselves from sin and, guarded against shameful passions, we remain free, being justified by a conscience that is no longer evil and having the soul in celebration. For what gladdens the soul is that it is not accused; for once this profession has driven out passionate desire and purified that state of mind which had spread throughout the soul, then it is in celebration and rejoices in God, being made joyful by confidence and dialogue with Him. Therefore, it is a feast to have a purified spirit and a blameless conscience.</p>
