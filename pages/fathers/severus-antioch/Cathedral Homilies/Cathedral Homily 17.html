    <h1>Homily 17: (Fragment)</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">(Moscow 385, 107 r°-v°)<br>
    From Homily 17 of Severus</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">He who always rejoices in Christ is not under this curse; and, what is most important, the Word of God, who for our sake unchangeably became flesh and was made man (manuscript: -πίσας), when he willingly went to the saving cross, indicating the reason for which he endures the voluntary suffering in the flesh, submitted to be crowned with thorns, as if crying out through the very things themselves that he wished to annul the sentence against our race, and for this he came, so that he might somehow blunt the sharpness of the thorns, which is indeed the sting of death, which is why he also bore it upon his head.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="subheading">(Moscow 385, 355 r°-v°)<br>
    From Homily 17 of Severus</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">It is God’s custom often to lead those who are in deep error towards the truth through the very error itself, and to make use of those things which they have experienced for the manifestation of higher things. Indeed, through the interpretation of dreams they recognized the true God Himself, and one said concerning Joseph: “Shall we find such a man in whom is the Spirit of God?”, and another cried out to Daniel: “Truly your God is God of gods and Lord of kings”. For indeed, as I said, to barbarian men who, as I said, were stubborn and occupied with the riddles of dreams and oracles, he could not send law or prophets, but through that very custom to which they were accustomed, he sent them the spark of truth.</p>
