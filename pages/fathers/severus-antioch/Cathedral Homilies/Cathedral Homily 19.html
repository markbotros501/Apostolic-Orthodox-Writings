    <h1>Homily 19: On the Drought</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">On the drought that took place, that is to say, on the lack of rain, and how we must be disposed in such circumstances.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Human life is for us a precise teaching about the judgments of God, about His wisdom and about His providence which penetrates everything, not only regarding what is allotted to us in a general way, but also regarding what happens in a particular way to each one; and it would be for us a sufficient warning concerning what one must do, and a fitting approach to the divine and charitable thought, to consider what happens daily, to praise and to recognize in it, even partially, the wise pilot and guide; for the Lord is recognized when He makes judgments<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, as the Psalmist says.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, if we were disposed in this manner and considered carefully what is done for ourselves and, in the face of our sins, we measured the benefits that come from above and those actions which are warnings—I do not indeed say "these scourges"—on the one hand, concerning what happens in our favor and according to our desire, we should thank without measure Him who, even when we sin, helps us without making us suffer; on the other hand, when some sorrows and difficulties come upon us, we should bear them with benevolence, repeat philosophically the divine words and say to the soul that is in sorrow: Do not turn your face away from the correction of the Almighty; for He Himself makes us suffer, and again He restores us; He will strike, and His hands will heal<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, and: It is for a few of your sins that you have been struck with rods<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">If, indeed, when it comes to what we grasp and understand, by paying attention, we find the wisdom of God, His justice and His charity, likewise, when it comes to what we do not understand—because in truth His judgments, as it is written, are the great abyss<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>—we can yield to His incomprehensible wisdom and let ourselves be persuaded that this too has been allotted with charity and for our utility; may it happen that we give thanks in all things<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>, according to the warning of the Apostle!</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Now, this has not been said for any other reason than that of this lack of rain, which lately was suspended above us, of the dry air that was above our heads, of the earth that was stifled by drought, and, afterwards, because of the abundant rain that occurred since, where there was no longer the memory of our sins, but which was delayed, in order to make us aware of asking the One who gives, and which was granted, before we ourselves asked as we ought, so that the gift itself is due to the benevolence of the One who gave and is not the reward of the request.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For it is He who cries through the prophet: And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; while they are still speaking, I will say: What is it?<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> Otherwise, if the unspeakable floods of all this charity had not forestalled the anger that was suspended over us, to what rage would not come the furious wasps of the Nestorian heresy, which buzz disagreeable and impure words, circulate between houses and slip into the depths of dwellings, and which perhaps through one or two foolish little women communicate their leprosy, while the whole city is healthy and by the grace of God closes its ears to their words?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For they said in truth that the reason why the earth was condemned to thirst was that the impure dogmas of the error of Eutyches were anathematized, as well as the fathers of these dogmas and the impious writers who divided the Emmanuel after the ineffable and unimaginable union, by the duality of natures. For they are accustomed to forge such things and invent fables, because also in the past, after Nestorius was driven out by a sentence of judgment which came from heaven and which was from above, Bishop Dorotheus<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>, stricken like him with the same rage, wrote to some that it was because of the iniquitous deposition of this one that there had been fires in the imperial city, raids of pillagers and enemies and the fall of the Empire of the Romans.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">These are, indeed, the things that they make gush from their heart full of mud, sometimes by forging and inventing, sometimes by gaping at the flesh and seeing only what is placed at their feet, without being able to raise their spiritual eye toward future hopes and remaining ignorant of what concerns the Holy Scriptures.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">As for us, although we looked upon the drought that God prolonged upon us formerly and the abundant rain that He had forbidden the clouds to pour and that He had stopped, as a test of the orthodox faith, which now has shone in a brilliant manner upon all those who are in the East, we thought that it is a punishment, when we applied our intelligence to the teachings of the Divine Book; for it is customary for God to test with pains those who have enjoyed certain benefits, so that, like slaves struck with rods and rebellious, we may know, in the time when we are helped, to recognize the Master, and, in the time when we are chastised, not to deny Him.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Thus it is written that He chastised the children of Israel. Indeed, after having brought them out of Egypt, and delivered them from a harsh servitude, after having shown them that He is the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, after having given them the knowledge of Himself, and proved His invincible strength by all these signs and numerous miracles, immediately He led them by means of an affliction and presented to them the test of a chastisement.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For He let Pharaoh pursue them with a great number of chariots and horsemen, while their flight by the Red Sea became without escape and without issue; and, when they had been caught in the middle and, in their souls no less than in their bodies, they were troubled and anguished, they lowered themselves to murmur without nobility and as befits slaves, remembering their servitude of Egypt, and placing themselves by thought on the banks of the Nile, they who shortly after were to dip their feet in the Red Sea.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But the great Moses was inflexible: after having looked in a terrible manner like little children at those who murmured and rebuked them as a master, he said to them, as much, in truth, as the time allowed to say: Have confidence, remain in place and see the salvation that comes from the Lord, which He will make for you today. For in the same way as you have seen the Egyptians today, you will not continue to see them in the time that runs from now on and forever. The Lord will fight for you; and you, be still<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>. Now it was to the people that he said these words, but to God, nothing. However, even when he was silent, God heard him: Why do you cry out to me?<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For, for men clothed with God<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> and who are holy, even if their lips are bound and their tongue nailed, their spirit cries out to God; and this is what Paul, writing to the Romans, said: But the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with ineffable groans; and He who searches the hearts knows what is the thought of the Spirit, namely that His intercession for the saints corresponds to the views of God<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For the soul that is attached to God speaks to Him continually, and it possesses the help that comes from Him, as the prophet David also says: My soul has attached itself after You, and Your right hand has helped me<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">It was at the moment when, being silent, Moses cried out in this manner, that he heard and received immediately the order to stretch out his staff, to strike the sea, to divide the waters, to make Israel pass, to swallow Pharaoh. And, after the expanse of the sea was divided, a wall was on the right, and a wall on the left<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>; for it is from the very words of the Divine Book that I will use, because only He who did this is worthy of faith to recount His own miracles, and also because, even when He is inaccessible, He speaks to us as humbly as possible, so that these divine thoughts may be easy to grasp, as much as is possible to our earthly intelligence.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Now who was it who worked the division of the Red Sea? It is Christ, who was prefigured by the staff, concerning which Isaiah, when he prophesied, said: And a staff shall come forth from the root of Jesse<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>; and David also called it a powerful staff, saying: The Lord will rule from Zion as a powerful staff, and You will dominate in the midst of Your enemies<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, the waters of the Red Sea, for the children of Israel, were a wall on both sides, but for Pharaoh and for the Egyptians, they were a wall for a certain time, as long as those who were pursued walked between the wet and fixed walls of the waters; after they had crossed and stood on dry land, the wall of the waters, when it broke, flowed and spread according to its own nature, became a tomb for those who had been left inside the sea, and it covered the pursuers as well as the whole army entirely, with their horsemen and with their chariots. That is why those who were saved sang a song of victory, saying: Let us sing to the Lord; for He is glorified gloriously; He has thrown into the sea the horse and also the rider<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But, moreover, the trial, the pain and the torment succeeded this marvelous salvation and this dreadful and grandiose miracle. Indeed, when they had walked for three days in the desert, thirsty and without drink, after the fire of a thirst that was so long, they encountered the very bitter waters of Marah, which He who ordered Moses to perform miracles made sweet immediately. In the same way, after the abundant gift of manna and the bread from heaven and that extraordinary source of waters coming from the unfissured rock, struck with the staff, which was the remedy and the healing of another thirst, they were tested by the combat with Amalek, with that cruel and barbarous people, whom they subdued and destroyed joyfully with strength and power.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">After they arrived at Mount Sinai, they obtained a legislation: Moses, on the summit of the mountain, received, on high, the tablets written by God; but the jealous demon, the Slanderer, not bearing the greatness of the glory, presented, below, the temptation of idolatry, and he erected as God a calf that recalled the error of Egypt.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And, to speak simply, during the whole journey and course of forty years, the children of Israel had enjoyed the grace of God without measure, and had been tested by chastisements; thus they obtained the Promised Land, which at the end Moses also, by elevating their spirit and making them remember these events, said by way of profitable teaching: And you shall remember all the way by which the Lord your God led you in the wilderness, to humble you and to test you and to know what is in your heart, whether you will keep His commandments or not<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>, and again: And you shall know in your heart that, as a man corrects his son, so the Lord your God corrects you<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">To this comes what Paul also wrote, in his letter to the Hebrews, saying what is treated philosophically by Solomon himself in the Proverbs: My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by Him; for the Lord disciplines the one He loves, and chastises every son whom He receives<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">How then shall we ourselves, knowing this, when we were chastised as sons by the lack of rain and by the drought, bear unwillingly the trial of the Father and be in anguish? Or how would a man endowed with intelligence and versed, even moderately, in the divine teachings, imagine, according to the chatter of the impious, that God was angry because of the proclamation of the orthodox faith and because, as on a stele, would be anathematized in a clear declaration the sons and disciples of the abomination of Nestorius? Indeed, punishment and trial of chastisement are quite distinct from one another. When they are examined instinctively, at first glance and superficially, it seems in every way to be one and not different; but when they are observed according to the nature of the things in question and one comes to know them also from their context, there is much difference between them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">That is why those who cannot discern such things, but who, in the face of trials and difficulties, recoil immediately without waiting for the end, shaken as they are in truth in their faith, and agitated by contrary changes, our Lord compared them in the Gospels to the seeds that are thrown on the stones, when He said thus: And what was sown on the rock, this is the one who hears the word and receives it immediately with joy; but he has no root in himself, he is a man of a moment; and, when tribulation or persecution arises because of the Word, immediately he falls away<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">We find a similar trial also in the Acts of the Apostles, where it is written thus: And Barnabas, he says, went to look for Saul at Tarsus; and, after having found him, he brought him to Antioch. Now it happened to them to be gathered a whole year in that church and to instruct a numerous crowd, and it happened that the disciples were called Christians for the first time in Antioch. Now, in those days, prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. And, when one of them, whose name is Agabus, rose up, he made known by the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine over all the earth, which in truth also occurred in the days of the emperor Claudius<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Now, as one of those who have the thoughts of this world heard these words, he said: "What do you say? While the preaching of the Gospel has taken its course, gathering an innumerable crowd, while the believers were then called for the first time Christians, and while the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled, saying: Those who serve me will be called by a new name that will be blessed on the earth<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>, should not this name bring every blessing, good weather in the air, abundant fruits, deep peace, so that all the world may know by the facts themselves that the name of Christians is truly a source of blessing, so that there may be a much greater number of believers, adhering without hesitation to this teaching procured by trial? But you, you prophesy to us immediately that a famine will occur, so that this name may lack happy blessings for men, as is likely."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But you will say: "God must torment the persecutors of those who announce the word. It was therefore necessary that it not be the whole earth that partakes at the same time in the punishment, especially not the disciples of piety." But thinking this is proper to those who have regard for the flesh. For those who know the laws of the Spirit know precisely that it is through tribulations, such as drought, that God is accustomed to test men, and they are of the opinion of the wise Paul, who says: Now all discipline, on the one hand, does not seem at the moment to be a subject of joy, but of sorrow, but in the end it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">That is why, after such perilous beginnings, namely these trials and these struggles, it is to this total appeasement that the great and divine mystery of the Christians has come. Consequently, as can be seen by current events, because of our weakness, we are no longer even worthy of a full trial. For God only brought the punishment near above us, but He did not truly chastise us; He threatened, and, charitably, He suppressed the threat; we cried out to Him, and He heard us. Indeed, He did not forget His own word, He who said: Ask, and it will be given to you<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>. He therefore gave not because of our righteousness, which in truth is not distinct from a menstrual cloth<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>, as a prophet said, but because of His promise.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Now we must consider carefully that He did not say only: Ask, and it will be given to you, but He added: Knock, and it will be opened to you<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>. Therefore when we ask, what obtains is on the one hand the word coming out by means of the tongue, but also on the other hand the fact of knocking, which is done by means of the hand. Consequently, for every action and every fulfillment of a commandment, it is the hand that can truly knock and open the door of Jesus. He Himself therefore acted in this manner which is proper to Him: He gave, when we asked Him, in order to push us to knock at His door, by means of fasting, deprivation of bath, lying on the hard ground, chastity and purity; vigils and offices, and above all, by means of mercy for our neighbors and by giving of what we possess. For this hand above all, before knocking close and lightly, so to speak, finds open this door, which even the lamp of virginity had not been able to open because it lacked oil<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>, as the example of those five foolish virgins makes known.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore we must be preoccupied with the gifts that come to the aid of the poor. If, indeed, as the Apostle says, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, you clothe yourselves with compassionate hearts<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>, you will despise neither the stranger nor the one who is naked. Now I admire the greatness of the word of the Apostle and of his thought, and I am filled with wonder. Consider, indeed, how he said: Clothe yourselves with compassionate hearts<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>, it is with mercy and with bowels of compassion for our neighbors that He asks us to clothe ourselves, as with a cloak; now he who is clothed with this gives to the poor all that he possesses; and, when on every occasion he abandons what he possesses in favor of those who are in need, he does not consider himself naked in any way, clothed as he is with compassionate hearts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">As for me, it happens to me to weep when I reflect to what degree and to what height of perfection we are called, toward what abyss we are descending in our spirit and toward what hardness and what sort of cruelty of a wild beast we hasten, even with regard to the cultivators. Those, indeed, on the one hand, pray in the same manner as their masters, that abundant raindrops may descend and not cause damage, that, one succeeding the other<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>, a truly serene sky and rays of sun that warm the seed may shine, and that there may then be good weather in the air; but, on the other hand, they alone work, while these masters take no part in it with them.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But, when the time of summer has come, after the harvest and the gathering of fruits, it is to each of the cultivators that, like a cruel demon, the steward, or the master of the land himself, comes to stand, holding in hand a document, stained, badly written, blackened now as by time and aged in evil days<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>, as the divine Daniel says, or even a volume covered with dust and filled with spiderwebs; then, after he has opened the document and fixed his eyes on it, and read these erased, invisible characters, difficult to decipher and which were known only to him alone or which by deceit and as in appearance seem to be known, and stirred his fingers to count, and murmured between his teeth some small words, and ran somewhere in haste, and after that simulated in appearance a nonexistent anguish, and scratched his temples, and rubbed his face several times, and showed hesitation in this, he mocks the cultivator himself at the height of misfortune and says: "This harvest of fruits is not sufficient in view of the payment of your debts; there remain with you arrears of debts that you have perhaps tripled or quadrupled, coming from the cycle of past years."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">O the ignoble and abominable word! He does not find it sufficient to take from him the fruits that are there, but, by the reminder of the arrears of debts, he frustrates him in advance of those that are to come.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">What complaints does this wretch utter when he returns to his house, in his indigenous patois, lamenting with some violence and heaviness, making his complaint noisier and crying words like these: "Woe to me because of my labors! Woe to me because of my profession of cultivator, in which I have tired myself without profit! Now I remember my oxen that I made advance with the goad and that I excited to open the furrow; now the plows, the hoe, the uprooting of thorns and brambles, the scythe with which I harvested the ears and the pruning hook with which I pruned the superfluous shoots of the vines; the proofs of these excessive labors, here they are on my hands, on which I shed many tears. Ah! the harvest of my fruits, which, before the harvest, was dear to me and well worth a prayer! After this, it is hateful, worthless and saddening.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">When the grains of wheat were sown, I trod them with my feet, and, when they were harvested, I took them with my hands; and, when they were stored in the granary, I spent the night near them to guard them; and they prevent me from putting them only under my tooth, while it has not been permitted to me to eat a single loaf of them.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">With what eyes shall I see my wife, this companion of my cares for cultivation, this auxiliary of my labors: when I sowed and when I harvested, she brought me my food outside in the fields; she shared my bed to sleep, also kept watch with me, and at the same time reflected and thought about the harvest of ears and grapes, which now the master of the land has reserved for himself and enjoys for himself alone. How would I be strong enough, when I see her weep? And how, when she attaches herself to me, rests on me and grieves at the same time as me, could I stop my lamentations and not add still more? What foods could I well offer her in place to persuade her to bear valiantly this intolerable affliction?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And how shall I cast my eyes on my children: one, being of age to do it, drove with me the pair of oxen, and rivaled me in fatigue in wielding the hoe, and, for the harvest, sharpened his zeal rather than the scythe? To all the best methods of cultivation he was trained and applied. Of the two younger ones, one, often when I sowed, carrying the seeds on his chest, gave them to me, and the other, throwing stones with a sling against the birds that peck the seeds, pursued them or chased them, frightening them by other means.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In the time of summer, once the season of fruits had come, they both sat in the field and in the shade to guard the fruits, not suspecting that, after having guarded them with such care, they would not even keep for themselves a small part. It seems to me that henceforth, these young ones, in their spirit, will have only horror for the countryside and also for cultivation, as of that which can bring them only groans and tears."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Are these things then bearable? Would they not bow even a soul that would be harder than diamond? Was it not due to the cultivator himself, even in very small quantity, to receive at least the wages of his labors? Or have you not heard Job, when philosophically, he counted this among the great iniquities, saying: The weak have cultivated the vineyards of the impious without food and without wages<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>. And James, one of the disciples of our Savior, when he wrote in the catholic epistles, as to put well in view the greatness of this sin, spoke thus: Behold, the wages of which you have defrauded the workers who have harvested your fields cry out, and the outcries of those who have harvested have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Then you, O lord who are interested only in mud and earth—but not at all, indeed, in perfection—or rather you, O slave of wickedness and of all the hardness of wild beasts, is it by these blows that you think to open the door of Jesus? And what! Are these things, and similar ones, not sufficient to close even the floodgates of heaven which in the days of Noah submerged the whole earth<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>, and to bring upon us winds and misfortunes of this sort, unless we change rapidly? That is why the prophet Amos also says: I myself have withheld the rain from you when there were yet three months to the harvest; I would send rain on one city, and send no rain on another city; one field would have rain, and the field on which I would not send rain would wither; two or three cities would stagger to another city to drink water, and would not be satisfied; yet you did not return to me, says the Lord. I struck you with blight and mildew; yet you did not return to me<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do you see that God brings such afflictions for no other reason than to make us return to Him? — "What then? Thus you order us to remit their debts to the cultivators." — Yes, I say, on the one hand, if they have resulted in this total and extreme shortage, they need to be given a remission; if, on the other hand, they are at half losses, why would they not have installment payments? For you, if you wanted to repent of your sins, you would not pay all your debts to God at once either. However, propose to yourself a good and charitable intention, and you will not need our words, and it itself will teach you what must be done.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now I see that it is not only in the village that you behave as the account has just depicted you now, but that you act similarly also in the city square, threatening, provoking, dragging to the tribunal, suborning with presents, dishonoring, striking, demanding what is unjust, passing by running without pity, as if they were inanimate stones, before those who stand in the roads, stretching out their hands and asking only an obol, which could be an effective help for hunger and indigence.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">That is why you seem to me even to be incurable. For, if you committed iniquity toward some, although you have pity on others, assuredly you would have no reward. There is one, indeed, he says, who builds, and there is one who tears down; what has he gained except toil?<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> When you thus commit iniquity at every hour, what hope would you have? Now, when you were divided in yourself between cruelty and mercy, were you going, upon hearing the words of instruction, to permit yourself, on the one hand, what is against nature and worthy of a savage head, and apply yourself, on the other hand, to natural perfection? Indeed, God can change us, even when we are incurable: for what is impossible with men is possible with God<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup>. To Him be the praise in the ages. Amen!</p>
