    <h1>Homily 10: On the Epiphany</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">1 It is again the feast of God and Savior Jesus Christ, and it is again the restoration of our race. He was born for the first time according to the flesh, and he shared my manner of birth, he who is without seed and without sin, he who knows all things before they exist. And mothers were delivered from the first sentence that was pronounced against them, upon receiving the (word): "In pain you shall bring forth children"<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, as a rebuke in response to the bitter taste and disobedience. Indeed, the angel announced this to the shepherds, saying: "I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people: for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord"<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. But with the pain was also destroyed the curse of our first father Adam. Indeed, the Mother of God, the Virgin, at the same time as these (words): "Rejoice, O favored one, the Lord is with you"<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>, also heard: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>; now blessing removes the curse.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">2 Furthermore, Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>, he who is Wisdom itself and gives to all wisdom and grace, so that in him, as in the second first-fruits of our race, we may ascend anew towards the grace and wisdom from which we had fallen, after having been deceived by the serpent.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">3 For towards what should he progress, he who is removed from all progress, the ultimate but insurmountable limit of all that exists, he towards whom converges whoever progresses in perfection? But what the evangelist called a progress is the manifestation that occurs little by little and the revelation of his divinity, which is revealed and known in relation to age and according to its measure. For this reason he also joined age with wisdom and favor, exclaiming as it were that if he who is without age and without time had not been subjected to age and time after becoming man for us, one would not say that he progressed in wisdom and favor. But because in truth he progressed in age, for this reason (he progressed) also in wisdom and favor, appropriating in everything our imperfection and forging for us a path towards his perfection. That this is so, and that it is the divinity of the Economy of Emmanuel, which, in its gradual appearance, is called a progress, this is how we know it.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">4 When his mother—I speak of the mother of God, the Virgin Mary—and Joseph were returning from Jerusalem after the feast of Passover and were looking for him on the way<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>, after he had voluntarily withdrawn from his traveling companions, and when they had returned to Jerusalem and found him, he said to them: "Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?"<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>. He did not mean anything else by this, except that He in truth and the Father are one divinity and Lordship, and that he whom they sought as a little boy who had lost his way, is the very one who exercises his dominion over all the (affairs) of the Father, as well as over the city of Jerusalem, which in truth was called by the prophets the city of God<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">5 After the evangelist Luke narrated this account, he added these (words): "And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>, so that we might learn that he called "progress" the gradual revelation of the divinity of Jesus. For he who has as his own everything that is proper to the Father, what increase will he receive? And yet he seemed to progress "with God and with men"<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> when a worthy idea of God progressed then little by little concerning him among men, which he manifested by the will of the Father, when he publicly showed, at the same time as the period of his age, the appearance of his divinity.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">6 It is in this manner also that he comes to the Jordan and to baptism, not because he himself needed purification, but because, for me in advance, he purifies and sanctifies the waters and he himself at the same time aligns himself with those who are baptized for repentance, he who is to baptize "with the Holy Spirit and fire"<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>, to purify from sin and to grant the grace of adoption. That he had no need of it for himself, when he was baptized for us, John made clear when he cried out, addressing him: "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>. If therefore the Baptist needed (to receive) a purification from the one who was baptized, it is therefore that He was without need and that he had in himself that which gave him his fullness.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">7 Let us also see what Jesus himself answers to these (words): "Let it be so now"<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>. He stops the Baptist, who had begun to proclaim the sublimity and the inaccessibility of his divinity, and he says: "Let it be so now." "Now," he says, "is the time of the economy, and not of the manifestation," as if saying: "What you say is certainly true, but it is not a matter of this present time." "For thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness"<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>. Now I fulfill the full measure of a voluntary humiliation, I hide my natural sublimity and I accomplish all righteousness. Now what is this: to accomplish all righteousness? He had to let the practice of the Law rest, not by "destroying it"<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>, nor by legislating to the contrary, but by making it pale and eclipsing it by the brilliance of the commandments of the Gospel. Indeed, whereas the Law says: "You shall not murder"<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>, he commanded: "Do not even be angry"<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>, so that in truth, once the anger that gives birth to murder is removed, the law that forbade murder would then be superfluous. Likewise also the (word): "You shall not commit adultery," is beforehand removed by the following prohibition: "Do not look (at a woman) with lust"<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">8 Therefore, because he had to let the Law sleep through the more perfect evangelical legislation, so that no one might say that he let it sleep as if he could not fulfill it, he fulfilled all its precepts: he undergoes the circumcision that is commanded in it<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>, he offers in sacrifice a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>, and he fulfills all that is in the Law<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>. That is why, seeing also the Pharisees and Sadducees coming eagerly to John's baptism<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>, he mingled himself with them, not despising this kind of humiliation either, but wishing to fulfill all righteousness. Now he who fulfills all righteousness had no need of the baptism which is celebrated for the repentance of sins.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">9 Moreover, he also had as his goal to begin with the perfect and authentic baptism of adoption, which he was in truth to bestow upon us; on the one hand, "he who takes away the sin of the world"<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> descends to the waters and is baptized; on the other hand, he breaks the power of the Slanderer, he who has primacy over the waters themselves and over the evil armies subject to him, and over the rebellious princes, which indeed David cried out beforehand saying: "You broke the heads of the dragons in the waters, you crushed the heads of Leviathan"<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>. For it is in damp places that demons love to dwell, as well as the Slanderer, the prince of those; they likewise rest also among men who lead a damp and dissolute life.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">10 That is why also he who spoke to Job says concerning the Slanderer: "Under every verdant tree he sleeps: near the reed, the papyrus and the rush"<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>, (plants) precisely which grow in the course of waters: it is of this subject that David the psalmist spoke in his prayer, when he predicted beforehand the appearance of the great God the Christ: "Lord, bow the heavens and come down; touch the mountains and let them smoke! Flash forth the lightning and you will scatter them; send out your arrows and you will rout them; stretch forth your hand from on high and deliver me, and save me from the great waters, from the hand of foreigners"<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">11 Now He who holds ready mercy and charity has heard: he has bowed the heavens and has come down<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>, that is to say when he bowed his celestial and sublime glory, so that by his voluntary humiliation he might be accessible to those who are on the earth. And he has touched the mountains, the principalities, the powers, the dominions of this world of darkness<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>; and they have dissipated like smoke. He has flashed forth the lightning, the brilliance of the preaching of the gospel, and he has scattered them. He has sent his arrows: the prophecies of the prophets, to which were then joined also the teachings of the apostles and he has routed (his adversaries). Now all these facts would not agree, if first the hand itself had not been stretched forth, that raised arm, the strength of the invisible Father<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>, the only Son, the Word who became incarnate for us and who, after having been in the midst of the Jordan and having sanctified the waters, has submerged the torrent of sin and has saved and delivered us from the great waters, from the hand of foreigners<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">12 Indeed, it is to recapitulate his benefits that the prophet David placed him himself at the end, he from whom also these benefits had sprung. It is because it is thus and that this is the reason why Jesus descended to the Jordan, that, at the moment when he came up from the waters, he opens the heavens<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>, closed by the first Adam, and he makes known that the virtue of baptism is to lead up to heaven. For it is for us that this celestial (being) accomplished all things, when, for our sanctification and for our salvation, he made himself our first-fruits.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">13 The Spirit also descends thus upon him because of us. Now this Spirit is not one of those spirits who function as ministers<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>, but it is (the Spirit) of God, the (Spirit) consubstantial and who reigns in truth at the same time with the Son and with the Father. That is why, indeed, the evangelist himself said in a demonstrative manner: "The Spirit of God"<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>, this Spirit who had abandoned the human race, concerning whom the Lord God said: "My Spirit shall not abide in man forever"<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">14 But this charitable being, who, by the largesse of his grace, as if he wished to modify his own decrees, abolished also for us this sentence, after having become flesh without change himself also, attracted the Spirit upon the flesh, at the moment when he united his divinity to the creature which had been condemned and when he thus sent grace to all our race.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">15 And he saw, says (the evangelist), the Spirit of God descending like a dove<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> in order to show clearly that the God of the Old Testament and of the New is one and to recall the memory of the flood which took place in the days of Noah. For, just as then a dove had announced the appeasement of the wrath of God, so still now the form of a dove makes known the flood of sin and the reconciliation of the world.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">16 To this, what do you say to us, you who uphold the phantasmagorical folly of Eutyches and of the attached Manicheans? If indeed the Word of God was not united hypostatically to the flesh which is of our race and which is consubstantial to us, in what way should the descent of the Spirit have profited us, after having come upon other lumps and not upon those of our race? And how has grace itself passed to us, this grace by which our Savior accomplished all things, if the dough were foreign and not the same as the rest of the work<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup>, which he precisely wanted to knead in himself? How, on the other hand, has the mention of the comparison of the appearance of the dove not instructed you of the truth of the "inhumanation"? Indeed the evangelists have said, concerning the revelation of the Holy Spirit at the edge of the Jordan: he appeared like a dove<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>. And Luke added also this (word): "In bodily form"<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>. And, concerning the Incarnation of Our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ, the God and Word, since in truth it was not only in appearance, but in truth, none among them has said: "he appeared as man," but in all truth he became man without change.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">17 That is why there is mention also of the Mother, although Virgin, and of the time of conception which is determined, although it had been without seed; and also of the childbirth, of the swaddling clothes, of the nursing, of the circumcision, of the progress in size, of eating, of drinking, and of the other particularities of the voluntary self-emptying; those however which are exempt from sin, which he took by his own will, for he was born of a woman; he was under the Law<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">18 But I pass to the voice of the Father which came from the heavens and which said: "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased"<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup>, and which tore out from its root the Nestorian impiety, which, after the ineffable and indivisible union, divides Emmanuel himself by the duality of natures. It is clearly indeed, and as pointing to him with the finger, that he said: "This is my Son," he who is seen by those who stand around him, and not, as Nestorius says, he who is hidden within him who is seen<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">19 Indeed, if that were so, he would say: "In this one is my Son," and not: "This is my Son." But when he said in a demonstrative manner: "This is my Son," he showed that he who is seen, because he was incarnate, the same is also the Word invisible according to nature and the true Son of the Father. For the (word): "He is" shows the truth and the equality according to essence in order to eliminate from there also the abomination of Arius who says: "There was a time when the Son did not exist"<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup>. Indeed he is perpetually, as the voice testified when it cried in the name of the Father: "This is my Son"<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup>. For, on the one hand, it is concerning creatures which come into existence in time that one understands "he was" and "he will be"; but God, on the other hand, is perpetually, being limited neither in the time which is past, nor in that which is future; but all time is present to him and he is without end and he is likewise perpetually and is changed by nothing.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">20 These words "Beloved in whom I am well pleased"<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup>, applied to the economy which concerns us, show still the greatness of the charity. Indeed, whereas we were under the empire of sin, we opposed ourselves to God as enemies, we became strangers to his affection, we were by nature children of wrath, without hope and without God in the world, worthy of hate and hating one another<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup>, and for this reason precisely hated by God: it is then in abolishing that hate and that loveless combat that he said: "Beloved in whom I am well pleased"<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup>, in founding in the first place upon Emmanuel the affection that he has for us. Indeed it is well known that he had no need of such a word, since he is the true Son who is loved by the Father and who loves the Father, or rather, since he is of the same unique essence and will.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">21 As for these (words): "In whom I am well pleased"<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup>, "I have called him beloved," he says, "by casting the seed of affection for the race of men which I would have had to hate. And if I am right to come to this, it is not for any motive whatsoever, but because it seemed to me excellent to save by your hands those who have perished and who have no longer any hope of being saved. For it is the good will principally which is the first and voluntary thought, not, it seems, for any reason, but because of his goodness. For God, as much as for anyone, there is nothing so good and which can rejoice him more, than to help and to save.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">22 But I see on the other hand that the hour takes hold of my discourse and that you are weary, not by satiety, but because the assembly has too much difficulty hearing; and I see myself in the necessity of passing over in silence John, that voice which came and which ran ahead before the Word; this (son) of the barren before that of the Virgin; he who was hidden in the desert and who, coming out as from secret and inaccessible places, appeared before him who came from the heavens and was born of the Father in an ineffable manner before the ages, and was born on the other hand in an inexplicable manner of a Virgin Mother according to the flesh, who rose for us and taught us this feast of lights. For we call "lights" this present solemnity, because in truth the three lights of the three hypostases, producing a single illumination which comes from a single essence, (namely) the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, have been revealed to us near the waters of the Jordan on this present day, to us who, being baptized in them, are illuminated.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">23 Who was therefore the one who closed this mystery of godliness<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup>? John, who was great among those born of women<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup>, this last of the prophets, who surpasses them all, in this that he saw him who had been prophesied by them, that he showed him to all and that he put an end to the prophecies which (concern him); (who lived) without food, who ate no bread nor drank wine, and who by his manner of life resembled the angels.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But what shall I experience? Pressed by time, shall I finish the homily? On the other hand I am subjugated by the perfection of the Baptist, and I am attracted to speak of it. However I will be silent, for fear that, in saying little because the hour presses, I treat badly him of whom one must make the praise, or rather, it is to you that I would do wrong in treating miserably that which promises great profit.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">24 Be therefore in fear, because, on the one hand, John exhibited such a manner of life in prophesying that of which we have the experience, and that, on the other hand, we who have been the object of the outstanding graces, we give ourselves over to pleasures, and that, when we celebrate the feast of lights, we perform works of darkness<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup>. He touched the feast of Christ, when he was baptized, after having descended to so much humility and having conversed humanly with men<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup>, because in truth the reason of the economy demanded it. But you, it is every day that you touch him entirely with your hands; you know the rest, you who are initiated, even if I cannot speak because of uninitiated ears. And when is it that you touch him? After the victory of the cross, after the destruction of death, after the resurrection from the dead, after the ascent to the heavens, when he comes entirely in a manner so worthy of God, that he makes his light shine in (our) spirits, and that it is not in a human manner that he remains by virtue of the economy.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">25 Prepare for him therefore your inn with magnificence, "wash your hands in innocence"<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup>, as the Psalmist says, by keeping it away from every impure and iniquitous work. Envy the abstinence of John and his renunciation of foods. Lucien also<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup>, of whom we celebrate the memory, has been adorned, after having rivaled with him, with the crowns of martyrdom, and now, it is through the intermediary of many of these beggars that he abundantly nourishes Christ, on the condition that you, in honoring his memory, put into their hands a few copper coins. It is for this indeed that the indigent hasten to the solemnities of the martyrs: to offer the sufferings of the athletes as prayers and to incline you to mercy.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">26 It is through them that Christ cries out, proclaiming loudly: "I who am hungry, will you not feed me? And, when I am naked, will you not clothe me?"<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup> Have you forgotten all those sufferings which were mine, which in truth I endured for you: the birth in the flesh, the descent to the Jordan, the cross, the life-giving tomb, the resurrection, the promised goods, the immortal hopes. Blush therefore at the thought of the combats of the martyrs and of the supplications of these poor by which they adjure you, and console their indigence, to the extent possible. Christ (tells you); do not neglect them, my brothers.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">27 It is through them that we shall render to (Christ) what we owe him and that we shall obtain the future goods by his grace and by his charity. To him be glory and honor and adoration with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen!</p>
