    <h1>Homily 3: On the Trial of Jonah</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">... as in the place where the singer (of psalms) says to God who is above the universe: <em>You wonderfully give light from the eternal mountains.</em><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> But to the adversaries, as in the place in Jeremiah, the Lord speaks at length to the Slanderer, the chief of their faction, saying: <em>Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, which destroys the whole earth.</em><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Likewise these (words): <em>I went down to a land whose bars closed upon me forever,</em><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> since these words do not at all apply to Jonah, I will apply them, and very rightly, to Christ, who broke the gates of bronze and cut the bars of iron in two.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Indeed, the gatekeepers of Sheol, when they saw Him, were seized with fear;<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> and He said to those who were in bonds: <em>Come out,</em> and to those who were in darkness: <em>Show yourselves,</em><sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> according to the expression of Job and the prophet Isaiah. The (words) also: <em>Let my life ascend from corruption,</em><sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> which were spoken by Jonah, must again be applied to Christ, of whom it was written: <em>His soul was not abandoned in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption.</em><sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Let no one examine these words, (to know) how, after Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, he was not corrupted. Indeed, when you hear the Lord speak of the sign of Jonah the prophet,<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> do not seek the "how" of the miracle, for there is no longer a sign if you explain it by natural reasons. For it is the property of miracles and extraordinary events to surpass the natural order. Otherwise, if we do not concede this, I will consequently declare even the miracle of the resurrection of the Emmanuel to be false. To this, what do those who are blinded by the miserable vainglory of imagination say to us? If, on the one hand, the figure of Jonah is real, the man who is consubstantial with us was swallowed and vomited by the whale without being corrupted or diminished; if, on the other hand, it is in imagination that Our Lord became man, that He seemed to bear the cross for us and descended even to the very gates of Sheol, how is it not a subject of derision, that the reality is the figure of imagination? But on the contrary, one must see that figures, on the one hand, are valid as resemblance and as obscure image, and, on the other hand, that what is shown in figures is an altogether real event.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">But you say that it is from heaven that the Word of God procured flesh for Himself. Adam however, who had committed the fault and needed healing, was earthly and formed from the mud from which we also were made,<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> as the book of Job says. Or else then, grant me that the first Adam who fell under sin was heavenly; or, if you do not grant it—for that is devoid of sense—then it is fitting to confess that the Word of God, heavenly and who is before the ages, hypostatically united to Himself flesh of the same race as Adam and consubstantial with us, for which He was also named the second Adam, and He appeared on earth and frequented men,<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> in order to make us ascend to heaven; and He Himself is the one of whom Job also wrote in advance, indicating both the figure of Jonah and his victory against the Slanderer, saying: <em>But let him curse it, he who curses that day, he who is about to kill the great whale.</em><sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, after having savored such profit from the divine dogmas, following the words of Our Lord and the history of Jonah, let us also burn with zeal for His virtue, let us be vigilant and persevere without interruption in prayers. Indeed, where did he pray and perform this continual exercise, if not when he was enclosed in the belly of the whale and implored God?<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> Let us also, then, practice this praiseworthy exercise, so that whenever we are swallowed by trials, as by a whale, we may be vomited forth by means of prayer, through the grace, mercy, and charity of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, to whom (be) praise with the Father and the Holy Spirit, unto the ages of ages! Amen!</p>
