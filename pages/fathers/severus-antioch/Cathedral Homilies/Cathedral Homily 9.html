    <h1>Homily 9: On Basil and Gregory, Bishops</h1>
    <p class="scripture-ref">It was delivered in the sanctuary of Saint Ignatius.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">1. Just as the prophet David considered it a happiness for him to meditate day and night on the law of the Lord<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, so, and even more, it is a happiness for me, it seems, to present to your minds, so to speak at every hour, the memories of those who have lived a beautiful life in this world, and the triumphs of those who fought for piety; or rather, for those who reflect seriously, it is likewise meditating on the law of the Lord. For he who admires the life of those who conducted themselves according to the Law, has in one way figuratively, and in another very literally, admired both the Law and the lawgiver himself.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">2. Whom shall we find then who, better than Basil the Great and Gregory the Theologian, having lived according to the Law, procure, by their memory, glory for the Law and the lawgiver, and profit for us who remember them? Those, indeed, those were truly spiritual shepherds of a spiritual flock, stewards of the mysteries<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> of the Spirit and true ministers of God and the Word—and of Christ the great high priest for us<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, he who inclined the heavens and descended<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> to the point of taking without change the form of a slave<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> and of becoming man without changing what he was, and who, after his voluntary self-emptying, returned to heaven in a more sublime manner.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">3. That is why, when after the end of the economy he ascended to the heights with his body, the angelic armies who honored and accompanied him, were not content to say to the spiritual spirits and their co-ministers: "Lift up your gates, O princes," but added these words: "Lift yourselves up, O eternal gates<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>"; now these words: "Lift yourselves up," indicate a more sublime praise. For he did not become higher than he is in himself—what could one add indeed to him who, from the beginning and by essence, is perfect; would one think that he became more perfect?—But to tell the truth, it is in our minds and in all rational creatures that he has come to be more sublime, after having given, in ourselves and in the incorporeal armies, a more sublime and perfect knowledge of himself.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">4. Indeed these words: "Lift yourselves up, O eternal gates," I apply them on the one hand to the heavenly gates according to a literal and obvious sense, but on the other hand they elevate the one who hears them to a higher thought. For, it is to every rational nature that it opens and removes the intellectual gates, so that they may receive him who is more elevated, given that he is sublime, and that concerning him they think what is more worthy of God and more sublime.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">5. I do not know what I felt: for when I prepared myself to praise the doctors of the Church, I do not know how, I came to end up at Theology and the great mystery of the Economy. However, even if I was led there involuntarily, I know that it was not from myself, but by a divine movement, which clearly indicates that the simple fact of remembering Basil and Gregory the Theologian leads the man who remembers them to perfection; just as it is absolutely necessary that those who approach fire receive in truth a share of the heat and light that come from it. This, however, is what the word meant to say, namely that after they imitated the humility of our God and savior Jesus Christ, they arrived at the summit of perfection.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">6. They indeed had the distinction of birth, abundant wealth, they had devoted themselves to all the wisdom of the profane sages, to the different meters of grammar, to the study of a chosen and distinguished language, to eloquent discourses, to persuasive rhetoric<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>, to well-founded ancient historical narratives, to the dialectic of opinions, to philosophical riddles, to geometrical definitions, to the subtle combinations of numbers, to the position and movement of the stars, to all that leads to a blind science of God and a falsely assured knowledge of things<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>; however, they *considered all that as rubbish*<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> and fell into the nets of John and Peter, those fishermen and ignorant men, and they considered Paul, the tentmaker<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>, as the doctor and guide of divine words.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">7. After having learned that *without controversy great is the mystery of godliness*<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> and having heard Moses say: *Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God, the Lord is one*<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>, and after having, by these words and others like them, recognized the sole Lordship and the divinity in three hypostases of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, they rejected the polytheism of the pagans; and since they had read these words: *In the beginning God made heaven and earth*<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>, they mocked the opinions of the philosophers, one saying: "Fire is the principle of this world"<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>, another: "It is water"<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>, a third: "It is another element".</p>

        <p class="paragraph">8. But, as for astronomy, that is to say the science of the stars, they considered as true and sure that which, from the beauty of visible things, leads back to their author, and by virtue of which the divine David, after having considered the God of the universe, said: *He who counts the multitude of the stars and gives to all their names: great is our Lord and great is his strength, and his intelligence cannot be evaluated*<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>. This (language) is not like that of those vain astrologers who, from the wandering movement of the stars, weave a destiny and a definitive lot, establish from them births and future events and deprive us of the Providence and guidance of God.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">9. After in these studies and others like them, Basil and Gregory—I take pleasure in repeating their names several times—had led the "monastic" life<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>, while they were still with their masters in Athens itself, there where the cult of demons was raging and where the doctrines of error were flourishing, they trampled underfoot the cult of demons and overthrew the pride of the pagans, by (showing) the contradiction and weakness of their pagan doctrines.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">10. Then, after they had tasted the cup of true Wisdom, after they had found a greater thirst for it, after they had been more abundantly filled with this drink, after they had become intoxicated with a praiseworthy drunkenness that banishes all sleep, after they had subdued the flesh by the labors of abstinence, after they had, by the bridle of chastity, stopped the ardent and untamable passions of youth, after they had exercised themselves in all the practice of perfection, then they ascended to the summits of contemplation.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">11. When they had (finally) received, besides the word of Wisdom, the word of knowledge<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>, (all) things in truth which are magnificent gifts of the Spirit, they were rivers of water to drink and living (water), according to the promise of our Savior, which they made spring from their breast<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>: and he who does not permit cities that are situated on the mountain of perfection to be hidden<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>, nor a lamp to be placed under a bushel<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>, after having called the great Basil to the desert and to monastic life, made him ascend to the seat of the Church of Caesarea, metropolis of Cappadocia<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">12. From there, Basil flooded the whole earth with his teachings, sending here and there, as from a single source, streams that gushed forth unceasingly; on the one hand, by addressing in his commentaries (on Scripture) those who were in the church, on the other hand by sending letters to those who were far away, he applied catechesis to the words of Genesis, and he taught the wisdom that is found in the works of Him who made them; he taught theology; he shut the mouth of the inventors of atheistic heresies; sometimes by fighting them in the assembly and refuting them by the words (coming) from his tongue, sometimes by countering the clever and subtle words of these (heretics) with arrows (coming) from his ink and his reed pen, he showed his strength and cut the knots that those considered impossible to untie, and that as easily as Samson the Nazirite did for the bonds of the Philistines<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">13. But Gregory, he who in truth is a theologian, received in charge the city of Nazianzus, which is the smallest of the cities of Cappadocia<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>: now not only did he not even judge himself worthy of it, but he even fled the honor of the episcopate, not measuring it by the importance of this city, but conscious that this power is unique and equal in honor for all those who exercise this sacred function, whether one thinks of a great city or a small one, he sent it back to those who are not instructed and who are very carnal.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">14. But, while, on the one hand, the impiety of Arius was growing and the Unique Word of God, he who is begotten without beginning and outside of time and incorporeally, as Word by the Father, it had counted him among the creatures and had introduced a new god as author of the worlds and times; while, on the other hand, Macedonius was coming to follies of the kind of Arius and transferring the same blasphemy onto the Holy Spirit, (Gregory) was sent by God to Constantinople<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>, for in this city the pestilence of these pernicious heresies was growing abundantly because of their weakness.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">15. But he who, from (behind) a flock of sheep, had taken David to make him shepherd Jacob his servant and Israel his inheritance<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>, that one also led Gregory, and, from the modest sheepfold of Nazianzus, transferred him to the imperial city. There, after having clothed him with the fullness of the armor of the Spirit<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>, after having made him enter into the cloud like Moses<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup> and having fortified his tongue by the fire of theology, he then made every heretic ear and spirit tremble by the prodigious sublimity<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup> of the discourses relating to divine dogmas. When, by the modest words of the divine book, he had strengthened the intelligence of the listeners, and unveiled the wealth of God-worthy meanings found there, he stopped at the same time the flow of that babbling and enemy tongue: for numerous at that time were the pernicious sophists who spoke and wrote as adversaries of the truth; but, in the manner of a Lion falling upon a band of foxes and wild goats, he put them all to flight.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">16. Who, indeed, hearing the Unique Son of God say to the apostles: *Go, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit*<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>, has the impudence to divide the unique essence and divinity of the three hypostases. For if there is not a single divinity for the three, there is also not a single faith, nor a single baptism<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>. And if the Father is neither created nor made, but the Son created, and the Holy Spirit a slave, they are therefore in every way created, and subjected to the Father, as creator and author. But how, with him who is not a slave and who by nature is free, does he count with him slaves, that is to say him and the Holy Spirit, and does he order to believe in an equality of honor between him and those?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">17. It is by words of this kind that Gregory, that eloquent theologian, triumphed, not only over the heresies of Arius and Macedonius, but also over all heresies, in the manner of a valiant gardener who, as soon as thorns grow, applies the sickle to them and sharpens it diligently. Likewise also for us and for all those who will come afterwards, may that suffice to eliminate what will newly arise at all times; but it is he who was such a first combatant and the first wrestler in the sheepfold of Christ, because for ten years in the imperial city he wearied himself in labors and sacred struggles: at the beginning it was in a modest house that he spoke to those orthodox who were very few in number; he reduced many heretics to nothing; he brought over to the orthodox faith, as one crosses flowing water; after persecutions, after having endured all sorts of evils, after having been stoned many times; while the tongue of the adversary had been weakened but their hand was still armed; after he was placed on the (episcopal) seat: when all the faithful, priests as well as those who were among the people, had taken him by force and made him ascend by force onto the seat, they crowned this honor, accepted it and gave him the reward for his pains: but he rejected this honor far from him and looked towards Nazianzus. When, at the council of Constantinople, the holy Fathers were then gathered in the number of a hundred and fifty-five, he made a speech, saying: Send me back to monastic life<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>, to the desert and to God; thus imitating the voluntary poverty of his Master, who, while he is the author of heaven, king and God of all things visible and invisible, took it upon himself for our sake to be registered in the house of his ancestors of Bethlehem and Nazareth.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">18. Are we then worthy to (untie) the sandal<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup> of those people, or even rather to (tread) the earth that they trod, we who burn with desire for the first places and for the first honors<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>, who gargle with wide-open throat about (our) apostolic seat, who raise our forehead more or less high, who puff up our cheeks, who spit profusely and walk on tiptoe<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup>. But perhaps we even find it painful to tread the ground, and we let ourselves be carried in triumph on large donkeys, with beautiful colored coats, advancing as on chariots, while we receive the honors of a crowd of people who march before, behind and at our sides; I say nothing of those flatteries in which every day we take pleasure. For that great word of honesty is despised; the appellation of piety is suspect and therefore taken for an outrage, but it is success to insinuate oneself in public by crawling, even if it means being, soon after, condemned, and, like the kings of the earth, we aspire to titles reserved for divinity<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">19. Therefore, in general, it is neither for utility nor for convenience that I hope for this charge for myself, and I cannot, according to received opinion, be proud of a seat so exalted; but certainly I deplore in the depths of myself that there is in me no trace of apostolic perfection, but I am tormented by sorrows: I will not tremble to touch only this sacred seat, but rather on the contrary to suffer there when I will sit on it.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">20. For he who wants to glory in apostolic honors and jurisdictions, let him conduct himself like an apostle and let him burn with zeal in perils for religion; otherwise, let him be turned to ridicule, because he wears a lion's skin, and he is but a sepulcher filled with dead bones, having, in fact of whiteness, only the color of the lime (that covers it)<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">21. How shall we come to the same state, I and Ignatius the God-bearer, he on whose seat I dare to sit? Does water not differ from fire? Thus, my dissolute life does not resemble the ardent and celestial life of that one. For, the perfection of Hippolytus, bishop and martyr, I pass over in silence as inaccessible, that (perfection) which the city of the Romans sent to us, in rewarding this Christ-loving city (Antioch), for the help given by Ignatius who went there to its aid, since he suffered there the combat of martyrdom and by it strengthened and confirmed the Christians. How then must I not lament over myself, to have a part in the same dignity?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">22. Let us flee then vain glory, O friends and brothers, and at every hour let us know ourselves. For those who know themselves are wise, as the proverb says, and let us despise these earthly honors that pass, and let us look towards those that are to come and do not disappear. Behold indeed Basil and Gregory these theologians: they considered these ephemeral honors and, judging that they were not worthy of the honor of him in whom they had put their faith, after having escaped them here below, they became bishops and doctors of the whole earth.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">23. You see that again our propensity to violence in words is taken from us; and as we abandon praises, we turn to teach a reform concerning the conduct of life and the knowledge of ourselves; but do not fear what is dear to those who receive praises and who esteem that this praise is their own property, but may it lead to progress. May we merit it, all of us and in all things, by the grace and love of our great God and savior Jesus Christ, to whom be glory with the Father and the Holy Spirit now and at all times and unto the ages of ages! Amen!</p>
