    <h1>SECOND ORATION TO NEPHALIUM</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">AGAIN, THE SAME SEVERUS'S SECOND ORATION TO NEPHALIUM; AGAINST THOSE WHO SAY THAT CHRIST IS KNOWN IN TWO NATURES AFTER THE UNION, AND ADD "UNITED AND INDIVISIBLE"</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But we, according to the salvific and truly divine symbol of the 318 Fathers,<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> believe and confess the Son of God, the Only-begotten, consubstantial with the Father, through whom all things were made, to have descended in the last days and to have been incarnate and inhumanated, that is, to have been united to flesh having a rational and intelligent soul, according to a true and hypostatic union, from the Holy Spirit and the ever-virgin Mary the Mother of God, and that his nature is one even when the Word was incarnate, as the deifying and mystagogic doctors of the Church have instructed us; and we know him, simple and without composition, according to which he is understood as God, also to be composite according to which he was made man. For, from two natures existing perfectly, from divinity, I say, and from humanity, believing Emmanuel to be, and the same God the Word incarnate, we know one Son, one Christ, one Lord; we do not say that he is known in two natures, as the Synod of Chalcedon dogmatized, adding, as if for the defense of its formula, the word "indivisibly".</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For it is not the same to say […] as to say […] Christ after the union, even if the word "united nature" is added, as the very synod testifies. For the memoranda of the synod have it thus: "The magnificent and glorious princes said: Dioscorus was saying: I accept the formula; but the formula […] I do not accept. But the holy Archbishop Leo said that the two natures are one in Christ the one Son, the Only-begotten and our Savior, without confusion and unchangeably. To whom, therefore, do you adhere, whether to holy Leo or to Dioscorus? The chaste bishops cried out: As Leo, so we believe; those who dispute are Eutychianists. Leo wrote orthodoxy."<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> See how they called the formula […] a heretical expression, but decreed the formula […] to be of orthodoxy, through it preparing that Christ be said to be two natures after the union. And yet, if they had understood this and that formula to signify the same thing, they ought to have said plainly that Dioscorus was contentious and fought in vain about words having the same force and significance. But they accurately knew that the formula: "Christ is from two natures" is the parent of the assertion: "He is one through composition", and they were very anxious lest one nature of the Word incarnate be said; but they received the formula […]; with the word "united", or "indivisibly" added for deception, and according to their own opinion, not observing the consequence.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For the formula […] indeed denies that there are two, but shows that he himself is one through composition, and that those things from which he is one have by no means perished, because they are united without confusion and that one remains firmly and unshakenly on account of the sublimity of the union; but the formula by which two natures are said after the union is from unnatural things: for if two remained, they are not united, since union is destructive of duality. And this, from those things which will be adduced afterwards, I will endeavor to make manifest, namely that hypostatic union does not admit division into two.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Hear therefore what the abominable Theodoret says, in contradiction 2 against the second anathematism, when he both says two natures and confesses them united, but denies hypostatic union, which the Synod of Chalcedon also passed over in silence. For he says thus: [THEODORET]: "But it is necessary to believe the Lord showing two natures, saying to the Jews: 'Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.'<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> If, however, a mixture had been made, neither would God have remained God, nor would the temple have been known as a temple—for this the law of mixture requires—and superfluously our Lord would have said to the Jews: 'Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.' For he ought to have said: 'Destroy me and in three days I will be raised up,' if indeed some mixture and confusion had been made; but now he shows the temple destroyed and God raising it. Superfluous, therefore, is the hypostatic union, which they propose, I think, for mixture; but it suffices to say union, which both shows the properties of the natures and teaches one to adore Christ."<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Again, in the contradiction against the tenth anathematism, he says thus: [THEODORET]: "But that which was assumed from the seed of David by him, that which is mortal, that which is passible, that which feared death, although this itself afterwards destroyed the power of death, on account of its union to God, who assumed it; that which walked in all righteousness and said to John: 'Allow it now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness';<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> this received the name of priesthood according to the order of Melchizedek."<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, with this one confessing two natures and also saying union, let us consider what Saint Cyril says in defense of the tenth anathematism itself: [CYRIL]: "How then do you say that that from God the Word is united to him who is from the seed of David, if you attributed the priesthood to him alone who is from the seed of David? For if the union is true, they are not two at all, but one and only Christ is conceived from two. It is manifest, therefore, that they pretend indeed to confess unity, wishing to deceive the minds of the simpler, but they understand an external and relational adhesion, which we also have attained, when we are shown to be partakers of his divine nature through the Spirit."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> But perhaps you will say: "Theodoret, because he said 'who from the seed of David', justly bore reproof, as speaking of a union of persons." But rather indeed he said "that from the seed of David"; and then also Saint Cyril himself, in the preceding statements, blames him on account of nature, saying thus: [CYRIL]: "But that diligent imitator of the abomination of Nestorius, this eminent Theodoret, is not ashamed to say that he assumed human nature and established it above common priests."<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">But the same lamentable Theodoret, in the reproof of the same anathematism, says: [THEODORET]: "But in the experience of our passions, the nature from us was assumed for us, not he who assumed it for the sake of our salvation."<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> Just as this one is refuted in his words because he calls without fear, upside down, person and nature that which is from the seed of David, as he himself says: "Who is he who was made perfect through the labors of virtue?"<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> and again: "Who is he who lived with reverence?"<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> and again: "The nature from us assumed for us"<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>: so also Leo in his tome, now indeed saying: "See what nature was transfixed with nails and hung on the wood"<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>, now however: "For although in our Lord Jesus Christ there is one person of God and man."<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">For who among those endowed with understanding, when he hears that in our Lord Jesus Christ there is one person of God and man, does not immediately think from the very expression that it introduces to us a union of persons, and not a hypostatic union made from two things, from divinity, I say, and from humanity? For if he had meditated to show us one and the same, he ought to have said: "For because our Lord Jesus Christ is one from perfect divinity and humanity, the same God simultaneously and man"; but that which he said: "In our Lord Jesus Christ there is one person of God and man", shows one to be God separate, another to be man, and already that appellation "Christ" to bind both together, just as Nestorius also says: "Therefore also God the Word is called 'Christ', since he has a continuous adhesion to Christ."<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> The same also in another place says that the appellation "Christ" is indicative of two natures, just as also the appellations "Lord" and "Son", and separately of this and that, so that there are two Christs and two Lords and two Sons and each again simultaneously with the other on account of adhesion. Thus he says: NESTORIUS: "When, therefore, divine Scripture is about to speak either of the generation of Christ from the blessed Virgin, or of the death, it nowhere appears putting the word 'God', but 'Christ', or 'Son', or 'Lord', because those three names are indicative of two natures, now of this, now of that, now of this and that."<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">But you can say the Synod of Chalcedon understood hypostatic union; for it said, in its definition, to acknowledge "one and the same Christ and Son and Lord and Only-begotten in two natures without confusion, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably, the difference of the natures never removed because of the union, but rather the property of each of the two natures preserved and them concurring into one person and one hypostasis."<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> But it is manifest to all those who are even moderately educated and erudite in the dogmas of piety, that it is contrary to say of one Christ indeed two natures, but one hypostasis. For he who says one hypostasis will necessarily also say one nature. Hear therefore what Athanasius, the light of the church of the Alexandrians, says in the oration on faith: [ATHANASIUS]: "And they went, from questions 'how and in what manner and by what consequence', into infidelity themselves; and instead of incarnation they established inhabitation, and instead of union and composition a human efficiency, and instead of one hypostasis of our Lord Jesus Christ two hypostases and persons, and instead of the holy Trinity they thought a quaternity indecently and illegitimately."<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> And again, in the books on the incarnation of the Word he says thus: [ATHANASIUS]: "We confess the Son of God, begotten before all ages eternally from the Father, to have been born according to flesh in the last of ages from Mary for our salvation, as the divine Apostle teaches saying: 'But when the fullness of time came, God sent his Son made from a woman',<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> and the same to be God and Son of God according to spirit, but son of man according to flesh, not two natures that one Son, one to be adored and one not to be adored, but one nature of God the Word incarnate and adored with his own flesh with one adoration."<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup> See how he said one Christ is one person, and one nature and one hypostasis.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Saint Cyril also proceeds with the same words as he. For he says in the work against the blasphemies of Nestorius: [CYRIL]: "Cease dividing the natures after the union."<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup> But the deceitful hearer will immediately dispute and say: "Behold, Cyril forbids us to divide the natures after the union; but I say them united." But he will hear from us: "We will not attend to your opinions, but from the father himself we will seek what he defines 'not to divide the natures' to be. For earlier he had said in the same oration: 'Therefore, as if from one person let all things be said; for one nature is understood to be after the union, the nature of the Word incarnate.'<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> It would have been necessary, according to you, for him to say: 'For two united natures are understood after the union.' But Cyril knows that the very union showed me one incarnate nature, the nature of the Word itself. That he also says the same Christ to be hypostasis is seen with no labor. For he wrote in the third chapter of his anathematisms thus: [CYRIL]: 'If anyone divides the hypostases in Christ after the union, conjoining them only by that adhesion which is according to dignity, or authority or power, and not rather by a congregation of natural union, let him be anathema.'<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>"</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But detractors again attack the things that have been said and say that union according to hypostasis permits us to say two united hypostases or natures after the union. But to this I do not need many words; for I will bring testimony from the adversaries themselves, showing that that congregation of hypostases, which is according to natural union, makes one incarnate hypostasis in the composition of the Son himself. For Andreas says, in the reproof of this anathematism: [ANDREAS]: "Again we will remind him of his own words, showing him saying two hypostases, in those things which in the first tome<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> he says: 'Therefore, according to his nature, that which is from the Father, the Word, is not sanctified with us; if anyone thinks that he alone who was born from the holy Virgin was anointed and sanctified and therefore also named Christ.'<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>"</p>

        <p class="paragraph">"How therefore, as if forgetful of his own words, does he think into one hypostasis, confusing the natures, calling the divine union natural?"<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Behold, he manifestly reproves the anathematism, as introducing one hypostasis. How therefore do you dare to call the congregation of hypostases made according to natural union two united natures or hypostases, not understanding that from union one nature or hypostasis is had in composition? That this is so, hear, with the testimony of the adversaries, the very word of Cyril. For he says in that letter to Nestorius, in which he placed the anathematisms: [CYRIL]: "Therefore let us attribute all evangelical expressions to one person, to one hypostasis of the Word incarnate. For there is one Lord Jesus Christ according to the Scriptures."<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup> It is evident, therefore, that those who gathered in Chalcedon, when they dogmatized Christ to be in two natures, inserted one hypostasis for deception. For if there is one hypostasis, there is absolutely also one nature, as has been shown before. For the divinely inspired word of the Fathers manifestly said neither two natures, nor two hypostases one Son, whether one says the natures united or separate. For indetermination, both according to external wise men and according to common notions, because it is generic, is comprehensive and rejective of both. And also especially on account of impudent speech, this is added: "but one nature of God the Word incarnate". Nor let them say that by saying "incarnate" he constituted that other nature separately: for that deifying man, having Christ speaking in him, would not have uttered a word so base and contrary, but would have said clearly: "not two divided natures, but two united".</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Similarly and consequently to that Cyril, Gregory the wonderworker also says, in the oration on faith by parts thus: [GREGORY]: "And he is true God, manifest in flesh free from flesh, perfect with true and divine perfection; not two persons nor two natures: for we do not say four to be adored, God and the Son of God and man and the Holy Spirit. Therefore we also anathematize those who are so impious, placing man in the divine doxology."<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> Consider how here also, without any distinction and determination, he rejected generally saying two natures. Nevertheless, if it had been legitimate to say two natures united after the union, he who spoke words equal to the words of the apostles would have decreed this specifically. Why therefore do you frighten the simpler, saying: "Behold, Saint Cyril, writing to Nestorius, says that the natures which were gathered for true union are indeed diverse"<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>, and you produce now things which are from your own heart, saying: "Therefore, if natures were gathered for union, we ought to say them two united natures"? For he is more worthy to be believed than your opinion, or your divination, as interpreting himself he says: "But one Christ and Son and Lord is understood from both, the difference of the natures not removed, but the division, on account of the union."<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup> For this we will wisely add: for diverse are the natures, from which one Christ; for divinity is not the same as humanity. But we do not make the difference of those things which are gathered into union, from which Emmanuel is composed, a cause of duality. For the Doctor cries: "Cease to divide the natures after the union"<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>: but not to divide the natures is not, as you say, to say two united natures, but to say one incarnate nature, as Cyril himself says. For thus he says: "Therefore, as if from one person all things were said: for one nature is understood to be after the union, the nature of the Word incarnate."<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> But the words "after the union" are not said according to distinction; not because, as some have thought from that, before the union there were two natures of Christ: for these words are of an intoxicated and delirious mind.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For before the union and incarnation, the Word was simple and without flesh; but when it pleased him to become flesh, according to Scripture, that is, to be united to flesh endowed with a rational soul, then from the very conception the Word God was incarnate and brought for us to our composition in an inconceivable and ineffable manner and as he alone knows. For we do not establish human nature separately, in the manner of the foolish Nestorians, and thus afterwards make God the Word dwell in it. For this is inhabitation, not incarnation, and consequently Christ will be found not God incarnate but deified man. For when we consider universally, we know divinity to be one thing and humanity another, and these are very distant from each other. But when we consider the divine union or inhumanation as it is comprehensible to us, we see from both, from divinity and humanity existing perfectly, Emmanuel compacted according to inexplicable union. And this is what was said by Saint Cyril: "Cease to divide the natures after the union", that is, after we have spoken of union.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is very superfluous and foolish to say two of him who is once united, just as if someone said after the evening star has risen: "The sun has not set", he shows something superfluous. For as evening is a clear demonstration of this, that the sun has set, so union is destructive of duality, although it shows from two certain things one to be compacted. For thus also Saint Athanasius says, in the letter to the august Jovinian, where he sets forth the orthodox faith to him: [ATHANASIUS]: "Therefore, perfection in faith is in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. The holy Trinity therefore receiving no addition, absolutely also by the will of the Father his only-begotten Word voluntarily communicated with our things and was born from the Holy Spirit and the Virgin mother Mary. One Son is also thus with the assumption through the economy of union. For simultaneously flesh, simultaneously flesh of God the Word; and simultaneously flesh endowed with soul and mind, simultaneously flesh of God the Word endowed with soul and mind: for in him it also had subsistence. Hence justly, indeed truly, the proper things of the Lord himself are proclaimed, not of some other. For before with that Virgin the Lord was divinely, afterwards from her the same was made according to economy Son. Therefore the Virgin-mother is also as the God-bearer holy Mary."<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore if in the very incarnation of God the Word the flesh acquired subsistence proper to the Word and Lord, but did not properly subsist separately, but came into composition and into union to the Word, and not from bringing, how shall we dare to say there are two, according to human thoughts, he who according to composition subsists as one, who is Emmanuel? For although the Word, as Word, is above all "becoming", because coeternal with the Father; nevertheless, because he wished to become flesh for us, he is conceived in some way also called to a second production on account of the created flesh, because it is united to him, and he is said to have borne fleshly generation, which was made from the holy Virgin.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Certainly! But behold Cyril says in the Scholia that "moreover, we will know from this that the natures or hypostases remained unconfused"<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup> and again: “Therefore it is not permitted to divide the one Lord Jesus Christ into a man singly and God singly, but we say that Jesus Christ is one and the same, knowing the difference of the natures and preserving them unconfused among themselves.”<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> And again: “For it is understood that it is altogether one thing in another, that which inhabits, that is, the divine nature in the humanity, not suffering any confusion or effusion or change into that which it was not. For whatever is said to dwell in another, that in which it dwells is not made, but rather one thing in another is understood.”<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Reading these demonstrations and expanding their own words, they say, mocking us, that “if the natures or hypostases remained unconfused, they are plainly two, if they are not confused even after the union.” But we, crying out greatly against them, say: We also know that those natures from which the one Christ is have remained unconfused and diverse: for the flesh remained flesh and divinity divinity, and neither departed into the nature of the other. But the union and congregation perfect for us one incarnate nature of the Son according to composition. For you cannot show me Saint Cyril anywhere in his writings saying that the union and concourse and congregation of natures demonstrate Christ in two natures, but on the contrary, one Christ from both, and his one nature as of the incarnate Word.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For behold when he said in the Scholia: “Rather it is understood as one thing in another,”<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> he added thereafter: “Moreover, the diversity in them designates to us the difference of the nature of the Word and the humanity; but one Christ is understood from both.”<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup> And again, he compares Christ to two sparrows, not because there are rather two sons, but because there is one from two, namely from divinity and from humanity gathered into unity.<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup> For it does not dissolve the union that Emmanuel is from diverse natures, nor does it cause that the one is understood as two certain things, just as Saint Cyril says against the reproofs of Theodoret in defense of the third anathematism.<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup> Certainly it is free from all blame to know perhaps that indeed one thing is, according to its own nature, the flesh from the Word, which proceeded from God and the Father, and another again according to the account of its nature, the Only-begotten. But to know these things is not to separate the natures after the union: Not to separate the natures is not to say two natures united or indivisible after the union,—this I will not cease to say very often,—but to say one, as we have already shown above. For behold, when he had said, in the writings against the blasphemies of Nestorius: [CYRIL]: “Cease to divide the natures after the union”<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup> and explained what it is not to divide the natures, he added afterwards: [CYRIL]: “Therefore, as if from one person all things are said: for one nature is understood to be after the union, the nature of the Word himself incarnate.”<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup> For to speak of union and afterwards to confess two natures, you will learn clearly from the things which must be said, was a concern even to the heretics themselves. For if Saint Cyril had used condescension towards the Orientals, who said: “Certainly the union of two natures was made,”<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup> but did not add: “The union of natures exhibited to us one incarnate nature of the Son,”<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup> so that they could no longer say two natures after the union, they had added also this: “Moreover, we know that some of the theological men make the evangelical and apostolic words concerning the Lord common, as pertaining to one person, but distinguish others, as pertaining to two natures, and assign those indeed which befit God to the divinity of Christ, but the lowly ones to his humanity,”<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup> when this lamentable Theodoret had found this out, see what sort of letter he wrote to John, bishop of Antioch: [THEODORET]: “God, who governs all things wisely, both foresees the concord of the churches and is zealous for the salvation of the peoples, brought it about that we met and showed the minds of all of us in harmony with each other. For when we had read the Egyptian writings in common and diligently scrutinized their meaning, we found that those things which had been sent from there were consonant with ours, and plainly contrary to the twelve chapters, against which we have not ceased to fight until now as alien to piety. For indeed they had that the Word which is from God was made flesh carnally, and hypostatic union and concourse according to natural union, and that God the Word was made the firstborn from the dead; but they rejected also the separation of the words spoken concerning the Lord and had many other things besides alien indeed from apostolic seeds, but akin to the sprouts of tares. But those which have now been sent are adorned with evangelical generosity. For in them our Lord Jesus Christ is preached as perfect God and perfect man, and two natures are acknowledged and the difference of them, and the union unconfused, not according to mixture or tempering, but made in a certain ineffable and God-befitting manner, and preserving the properties without injury to the natures; and indeed God the Word impassible, but the temple passible and handed over to death for a brief time and again raised by the power of God united to it; and the Holy Spirit does not have existence from the Son or through the Son, but proceeds from the Father, but is called proper to the Son as consubstantial with him. Having introduced this rectitude in the writings, and finding it now opposed as if diametrically to the previously written, we praised him, who heals stammering tongues and changes a deformed voice into a sweet voice.”<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Behold we have heard this plainly: to say two natures after we have confessed the union removes the hypostatic union, and to say two natures fights against the chapters of Saint Cyril and is opposed to all his writings. But let us see whether Cyril himself, constructing a defense of his condescension towards the Orientals, persuades us to understand the saying by them, namely that the union of two natures was made, so that we understand Christ to be in two natures, or rather that we understand one incarnate nature of the Word to be perfected from the union. Attend therefore to what he says in his letter to Acacius, bishop of Melitene: [CYRIL]: “Moreover we have by no means removed the difference of the words, although we abhor dividing them, as to the Son separately, the Word which is from God and the Father, and again as to the man, who is from a woman, the Son understood separately. For there is most certainly one nature of the Son: but we know it to be incarnate and inhumanated.”<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> However, what ought he to have said, if Christ were in two natures? “For there are two natures of the Son: for he is incarnate and inhumanated.” But none of those who think rightly is ignorant that he who is united is one, not two. Similarly, in his letter also, to Eulogius, an Alexandrian presbyter and his apocrisiarius, he wrote thus: [CYRIL]: “If therefore we say union, we confess the union of flesh endowed with a rational soul and the Word, and even those who say two natures understand it thus. Nevertheless, union now being asserted, the things which are united are no longer separated from each other, but now there is one Son, and his one nature as of the incarnate Word. This the Orientals have confessed, although regarding the very formula they were obscured by darkness.”<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Consider carefully how he said that even those who say two natures understand thus, that is, that the union of flesh endowed with a rational soul and the Word was made, but he did not say that they speak well, but that they understand thus or that it must be understood thus; and he shows that they fall into contradiction. For union now being asserted, the things which are united are no longer separated from each other, but now there is one Son, and his one nature as of the incarnate Word. For when they say two natures, they separate them; but when they confess union, they are compelled to say one incarnate nature of the Word. And now as if in dense darkness they strike themselves and it happens to them that regarding the very formula they are obscured by darkness, just as Saint Julius also says in the letter to Dionysius, bishop of Corinth: [JULIUS]: “But those who confess that God hidden in the heavens is incarnate from the Virgin and is one with his flesh, are troubled in vain, being led to the words of their impiety: for they also say two natures, as I hear.”<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">You see that to say one incarnate nature, and again to say two natures after they have confessed one, belongs to those who disturb and trouble the order of things and rise up against themselves, as Julius himself afterwards adds, mocking such a base and mad repugnance of their speech.<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup> For thus he says: [JULIUS]: “Therefore those who think thus, lest they go out to concord with those thinking contrarily, lest praising and glorifying Christ in mind, they blaspheme him in words. For it is necessary for them, where they say two natures, to adore one indeed, but the other not to adore, and to be baptized indeed into the divine, but into the human not to be baptized. But if we are baptized into the death of the Lord, we confess one nature of the indivisible deity and his passible flesh, so that thus our baptism may be perfect into God and into the death of the Lord.”<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup> Nor does he say that we ought to confess one nature according to confusion, but from diverse natures he knows that one Emmanuel. Hear what things he wrote also in another place: [JULIUS]: “Whence necessarily both his bodily from the whole and his divine from the whole is said, and he who cannot in diverse things, which are united, recognize what is proper to each, will fall into opposites discordant among themselves; but he who recognizes the proper things and preserves the union, will neither lie concerning the nature, nor will he be ignorant of the union.”<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Behold also where he confesses Emmanuel to be one nature, Julius knows the difference of those things which were brought to union, nor does he divide the properties of the humanity to the humanity separately, and again those things which befit God properly to his divinity, but he decrees that both his bodily from the whole and his divine from the whole must be said, and indeed most fittingly, for Christ is one from both. But, again the adversaries will say: “Behold Saint Cyril says in the first letter to Succensus: ‘We see two natures to have been gathered among themselves according to an indissoluble union.’<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup> How therefore shall we not say that Christ is in two united natures?” But rather indeed we have already shown in the above statements, using the very words of Cyril, not saying things drawn from our own heart, that the congregation or union of natures exhibited to us one incarnate nature of the Son, and likewise that to say two natures after the union is a dissolution of the union. Nevertheless from the very letter to Succensus let us see what he says is perfected from the congregation of natures: whether it must be said that there is one nature of God the Word incarnate, or that Christ must be defined as in two united natures?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">He therefore brings forth after those sayings, which have been adjoined a little before, these; but it is best to adjoin the whole passage: [CYRIL]: “We see two natures to have been gathered among themselves according to an indissoluble union, unconfusedly and unchangeably: for the flesh is flesh, and not divinity, even if it has become flesh of God; similarly however the Word is God, and not flesh, even if he made flesh proper to himself according to the economy. Therefore when we consider this, we injure nothing of that concourse into union, saying that it is made from two natures; but, after the union, we do not separate the natures one from the other.”<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Nor may you again anticipate and say to me: Nor do we separate them, but we say they are united! But, wait a little that you may learn from this very thing that not to separate is held to be that one incarnate nature is said after the union. For Cyril adds: “Nor do we divide that one and impartible into two Sons, but we say one Son, and, as the Fathers said, one nature of God the Word incarnate.”<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup> Indeed, but he also says: “We say that the two natures are united.” But before he told you that the union of natures exhibits to us one nature of God the Word incarnate. And you may see how he says: “Therefore as far indeed as pertains to thought and to contemplating only with the eyes of the soul how the Only-begotten was inhumanated, we say that there are two natures, which are united.”<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup> Moreover, how is it not manifest and clear to anyone that, if he knew it were legitimate to say two natures after the union, he would not say: “as far as pertains to thought and to contemplating only with the eyes of the soul,”—which he is accustomed to say concerning those things which through concession agree with reason, in a matter which is not thus according to nature,—for the illustration and manifestation of this, which has been posited before. For that to say two natures removes the union, he himself shows in the second letter to Succensus, saying: “so that those two are now not two, but from both one animal is perfected.”<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup> For if it happens that, while someone speaks concerning one nature, but composite, and wishes to show the things from which it is composed, he speaks as of two things, he does not prepare that that one nature be understood as two. Hear what he says in the defense of the eighth anathematism against the reproofs of Andreas: [CYRIL]: “For when concerning one person and nature or one hypostasis a discourse diligently examining the things from which it is or is composed naturally, subjoins the preposition ‘with’ or ‘together with’, it preserves even thus for that which is signified, that it is one according to composition, and does not discern it separately into two. But when to hypostases previously distinct into two and to this end that each be conceived separately and singly, the preposition ‘together with’ or ‘with’ is said, then we say the preposition is significative of two or even more, but not of one composite. For example, if perhaps I say that the soul of man is co-honored with his body, whatever honor is made towards the one, who is from both, the man; or if someone says that the soul is one animal with its proper body, he by no means defines that one into two men, but rather seems not to be ignorant of the things from which that man is or is composed naturally. But when I say that Peter and John are co-called men, or: With Peter also John is co-called a man, or: With Peter also John was ascending into the temple, the preposition ‘with’ or ‘together with’ no longer makes a signification of one certain thing: for Peter is not composed with John, nor do both meet in the constitution of one man. Why therefore do they contrive against the truth, dividing that one into two Christs unlearnedly!”<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">And these indeed are the words of Saint Cyril; then it is good for us to observe that Saint Cyril knows Christ to be one person and one nature and one hypostasis in the adjoined sayings. For Andreas was reproving him as saying that the Son sat together with the Father with his own flesh; and Cyril himself defending himself says: having spoken concerning one person and one nature and one hypostasis, I did not sin saying “with his flesh”: for the preposition preserved even thus for that which is signified, that it is one according to composition. How therefore do not the adversaries blush where they say that he who says “one nature of the Word” and moreover proclaims “incarnate” numbers that other nature with it?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For behold on account of the calumnies and sophistic and deceitful objections of the heretics, Theodotus, bishop of Ancyra, does not consent even in subtle thoughts that the union be divided, blocking every approach to heresy. For he says in the oration which he delivered at Ephesus before the synod which ejected Nestorius: [THEODOTUS]: “Where is he who divides Christ? Where is he who makes our mystery a homonymy? And he says indeed one Christ, but posits two, one indeed servant, but the other Lord, one suffering [the other impassible]! What utility is there of one appellation, where two things are posited?”<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup> And again the same, in the oration on the nativity of Christ in the flesh, said thus: “For that which is united is now not called two, but one. But if again you divide in thought, and contemplate each singly, therefore you dissolve the union. For it is impossible both to preserve the union and to contemplate each of them singly. But that which is united has become one inseparably, nor does it any longer become two. But I separate only in thought, he says. Therefore by the same thought you have also dissolved the union: for by that you remove one from the other, by that very thing you have also cut the union. Why therefore do you overturn the salutary dispensation, understanding two and spurning the union?”<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup> But that intending to block every contrivance and approach to those who wish impiously to cut the mystery of the dispensation into two, he says these things, and not, as someone might think, dogmatizing mixture and effusion or that which is called theopaschism, is easy to see from this. For he says in another homily on the nativity of Christ thus: [THEODOTUS]: “For what reason therefore did he make the passions of men proper to himself? Because he wished to destroy passion through passion and abolish death by death and condemn like by like. Therefore he appropriates the cross to himself and makes the blow and bonds proper to himself, that the passions made of God might receive power against passions. For neither was the nature of God injured, nor did it undergo change on account of the passions, and the passions receive from God power against passions similar to themselves. For now, as made of God, death destroys death, and dying he loosens the tyranny of death.”<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">But perhaps they will say: Behold Gregory Nazianzen said: “Indeed the natures are two, God and man, because also soul and body are two natures; but the Sons are not two, nor gods.”<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup> But to them, where they say this, we persuade them to read the things which are adduced afterwards. For Gregory says: “Indeed one thing and another are those things from which our Savior is,—since indeed that which cannot be seen is not the same as that which falls into sight, and that which is free from time is not the same as that which is subject to time,—but not one person and another, far be it! For both these are one by commixture, since indeed God is inhumanated, but man deified, or by whatever name one might use.”<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">You may see how he said: “the things from which our Savior is,” but not: “the things in which our Savior is.” For we say Emmanuel from two natures, but we do not believe him to be in two natures: for divinity is one nature and humanity another; but, union having been proclaimed, Christ is one from both and his nature is one as of the incarnate Word.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But lest you think that he says two natures, he produced another deletion of duality, saying: “For both these are one by commixture,”<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup> since through this he wished to show a close union. For the incorporeal does not undergo change into that which it was not: and this he forewarned by saying: “one thing and another are those things from which our Savior is.”<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup> For it is impossible that we say the same one Christ to be two natures, according to you, and fall into opposition to commixture. But it is known to those who are wise well that Gregory also avoids each accusation, and confesses the hypostatic union indivisibly and unconfusedly. For even when we hear God and the Father saying to the Son in the psalm: “From the womb before the morning star I begot you,”<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup> we do not think the generation to be carnal on account of that name of womb, but understanding those things which befit an incorporeal nature, consequently we believe the generation to be incorporeal, since the formula “from the womb” indicates truly and from the very substance of the Father the Son to have been begotten, so that he is consubstantial with his Begetter.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But he said in his letter to Cledonius thus: [GREGORY NAZIANZENUS]: “Therefore retain the whole man, and mix the divinity, that you may benefit me perfectly”; then, he objects to himself: “But two perfects did not contain”, and he solves the objection saying: “Not indeed, if you understand corporeally. For a vessel of one modius capacity will not contain two modii, nor a place of one body two or more bodies. But if you consider them as intelligible and incorporeal, notice that I myself have contained both soul and reason and mind and the Holy Spirit, and before me this world,—this structure, I say, from visible and invisible things,—the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. For such is the nature of intelligible things, that they are mixed in an incorporeal and inseparable manner both among themselves and with bodies, since also many voices are grasped by one hearing and the same sight sees many things and the smell smells many odoriferous things, since the senses are not mutually compressed or constrained, nor are the sensible things diminished on account of the abundance of reception.”<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup> Behold he clearly shows how the incorporeal is united unconfusedly and inseparably to the body, and does not suffer confusion, which arises from mixture and tempering: for this is the property of humid bodies, that they are confused and commingled from mutual implication and depart from their proper natures.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Besides the fact that he did not speak of commixture, he also thought that God the Word was united hypostatically to flesh having a rational soul, and not only through inhabitation. Hear what he says in the same letter: [GREGORY]: “If anyone says that man was first formed, and that God afterwards dwelt in him, let him be damned. For this is not a generation of God, but a flight from generation.”<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup> And again: “If anyone says that the Word operated in him as in prophets according to grace, but not that the humanity according to substance adhered to the divinity and was co-formed, let him be void of more excellent efficacy, indeed full of contraries.”<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup> And again: “If anyone says that Christ passed through the Virgin as through a channel, but not formed in a divine and human manner simultaneously: divine indeed, because without a man, but human, because according to the law of conception. Likewise, he is an atheist, L "And again: 'If anyone does not believe Mary is Theotokos, he is an atheist<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup>.'" AND AGAIN: "If anyone does not adore the Crucified One, let him be anathema<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup>."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Certainly, but the same Gregory says, in the first oration concerning the Son: "Attribute the sublime things to the divinity and to the nature superior to passions and body, but the lowly things to the composite and for your sake emptied and incarnate; not inappropriately it is also said: inhumanated<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup>." How then is Christ not said to be two natures? For in this way also Leo says in his Tome: "One of these indeed shines with miracles, the other however succumbs to injuries<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup>." But in no respect are the words of Gregory conformable to those which have been dogmatized by you. For Gregory, when he said the sublime things must be attributed to His divinity, he was not speaking of those things which Christ did according to the dispensation, when he was inhumanated, but of those things which He had before inhumanation, when He was without flesh and before the ages: which Gregory was enumerating a little before this passage, but you have wickedly cut them off by distorting those things which were well said to that which pleases you. For thus he said: [GREGORY]: "That which was in the beginning, that which was with the beginning, that which is the beginning: In the beginning was the Word<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup>." AND AGAIN: "Splendor, and character of His hypostasis, and image of His goodness; and He whom the Father sealed, God, Lord, King, Being, omnipotent<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup>." These things God the Word evidently had before inhumanation, and these Saint Gregory said must be attributed to the superior nature, which have absolutely no communion with the rationale of inhumanation, before the Son came to the voluntary emptying. But Gregory said most excellently that all the lowly things which seem to happen to Him on account of the incarnation must be attributed, not to one of the forms or natures—for thus he would have introduced division—but to the Word incarnate for our sake.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Hear indeed what he says in the passage brought forward by you: [GREGORY]: "But the lowly things to the composite and for your sake emptied, not inappropriately however it is also said also to the inhumanated<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup>." For he does not foolishly divide Him who is united to flesh in an indivisible manner, but knows Him as one and the same, just as he signifies by adding to the statements placed just before, saying thus: [GREGORY]: "For He who is now despised by you, once was also above you; He who is now man, was without composition. That which He was, He remained; that which He was not, He assumed<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup>."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">These indeed are the words of the saint; but yours are such: You divide those things which were done by our Savior at the time of inhumanation, attributing indeed those things which befit God to the divine nature, but the human things to the human nature. For does not Leo thus instruct his own in his Tome, saying: [LEO]: "To hunger indeed and thirst and grow weary and sleep is most certainly of man. But to satisfy five thousand men with five loaves and to give the Samaritan woman living water from which, when she drinks, it will be provided for her that she thirst no more; and to walk upon the surface of the sea with feet not made wet, and by rebuking the rising of the waves to calm the storm, is without ambiguity of God<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup>." And already before this he divided the actions, saying: "With the body indeed performing singly those things which are of the body, but with the Word singly those things which are of the Word; and one indeed succumbs to injuries, the other however shines with miracles<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup>."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Therefore do not mix among themselves those things which cannot be mixed: for there is no fellowship of light with darkness. For it is one thing to divide Christ into two natures, another thing to say that those things which God the Word had naturally and were His before inhumanation, when He was without flesh and before the ages, must be attributed to the divine nature, even if we say that His rationally ensouled flesh was also enriched by those things which the Word naturally had, such as to create, to give life and all things which befit God, which belonged to Him before the ages, on account of the marvelous and supernatural union to the creating and life-giving Word. For indeed, the divine nature of the Word, considered separately and without flesh, is before much time, indeed before all ages. It is necessary, therefore, when we contemplate His essence singly, that He has the properties, those, I say, which before His inhumanation pertain to Him and are seen in Him, such as the titles "Omnipotent" and "Lord" and "King of hosts." But the nature of man, which God the Word united to Himself, never existed singly, but as soon as He willed to become man, immediately He was God incarnate from the Holy Spirit and from the holy Virgin, not however a pure man existing singly and having God dwelling in him: which necessarily dualism of natures must introduce.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Knowing, therefore, that Saint Gregory attributed the lowly sayings or actions not to the human nature considered separately, but to the composite and for your sake emptied, incarnate and inhumanated God the Word, if you find him saying, in the second oration concerning the Son, thus: "It would remain for us to speak<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup> concerning Him who receives a command and keeps the commandments, and who always does the things which are pleasing to the Father; again, however, concerning the consummation and exaltation, and concerning Him who learned obedience from the things which He suffered; likewise concerning the high priesthood and offering, concerning the supplication to Him who is able to save Him from death; concerning fear, sweat of blood, and if there is anything else of this kind; unless it were clear to anyone that the passible element is referred to by such names, not however to the immutable and nature superior to passions<sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup>," from these do not think that he entirely divides Christ, and attributes suffering singly to the human nature: for He who suffers, just as Gregory said in the preceding, is "the composite, God the Word for your sake emptied and incarnated and inhumanated<sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup>," suffering in that which was born to suffer, evidently in the flesh. Hear also the same Gregory saying this same thing again in the beginning of that same second oration concerning the Son, speaking thus: [GREGORY]: "The more sublime indeed and God-worthy utterances we attribute to the divinity, but the lowly and human ones to the new Adam for our sake and to God passible against sin<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup>." But perhaps you will say: "He introduces a passible divinity with these words." Far be it: for by this appellation "Adam," He is first introduced, and thus it is shown that God suffered in the flesh, according to the Scriptures.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Again they say: Behold in the same second oration concerning the Son the same Saint Gregory says: "A sign however is that when the natures are separated by thoughts, simultaneously also the names are divided with them. Hear Paul saying: 'That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory'<sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup>: He is indeed called God of Christ, but Father of glory. For although the congregation—that is, of both—is one, yet this is not by nature, but by coition<sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup>.'" But, if they understood the things which they think should be alleged, they ought rather to blush where they hear: "when the natures are separated by thoughts." For he who says this shows Him to be one according to truth and in no way divided, who is divided only by thought. For he who hears that God is the Father of Christ, understands that, insofar as Christ willed to become man, so far He calls God His Father, saying: "I ascend to my Father and your Father, my God and your God<sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup>"; but insofar as He is of the same glory and substance as the Father, to call Him His Father properly and truly and according to nature. For our Father is Father by grace, not by nature. Then it would be necessary to understand also that which this saint said, namely that the congregation is one, not indeed by nature, but by coition. For by nature divinity remained divinity and flesh remained flesh; but by coition and union both are one, and in no way are they divided, just as in this same letter to Cledonius the same Gregory says: "With natures mixed so also with names and mutually exchanging among themselves according to the rationale of congeniality<sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup>."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Again the adversaries say: "Behold again the same Gregory says, in the oration on Epiphany: 'He was indeed sent, but as man: for He was twofold<sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup>.'" But again we say to them: The mind of this saint escapes you! For he calls Him twofold wishing to show Him one from two, as he himself explains in the same oration, saying: [GREGORY]: "But God proceeded with the assumption, one from two mutually contrary things, from flesh and from spirit, of which one indeed He deified, the other however was deified. O new mixture! O marvelous tempering! He who was, becomes; and creator is created, and the incomprehensible is comprehended<sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup>." For indeed, according to one thought Gregory says Christ is twofold, so that he may illustrate this, and according to another thought Nestorius says this, and you with him. And see what he says: [NESTORIUS]: "For the Virgin Christ-bearer bore the Son of God; but because the Son of God is twofold regarding natures, she bore not the Son of God, but the humanity, which is Son on account of the Son conjoined to it<sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup>." And again: "I distinguish twofold natures in Christ: for they are twofold according to nature, but according to dignity singular<sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup>." Therefore also Saint Cyril wisely rebukes him in the letter to Nestorius himself, saying: [CYRIL]: "Moreover, the utterances spoken concerning our Savior in the gospels we distribute neither to two hypostases nor to two persons; for the one and only Christ is not twofold, although He is understood to be from two things brought into unity indivisibly, just as man also is understood to be constituted from soul and body, and is in no way twofold, but rather one from both<sup><a href="#fn92" id="ref92">92</a></sup>." But also in the writings against the blasphemies of the same Nestorius, namely in the second tome, he says to him: [CYRIL]: "For not because the Word, which is from God and the Father, became man like us, for this reason also will He be called twofold<sup><a href="#fn93" id="ref93">93</a></sup>."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Therefore, by all these things it has been shown that no one says Christ is two natures after the union. For he who says two natures, entirely divides. In vain he adds saying: "I confess them to be indivisible natures." And that these things are so, hear what Saint Cyril says in his second letter to Succensus: [CYRIL]: "But that 'indivisibly' added by them is considered indeed in a certain way among us significative of right opinion; but they do not understand it thus. For that 'indivisibly' among them is accepted according to another manner of the vain talk of Nestorius. For they say that by equality of honor, identity of will and authority, the man in whom the Word dwelt is undivided from God the Word. And so they do not utter words simply, but with a certain cunning and deceit<sup><a href="#fn94" id="ref94">94</a></sup>." To say union and to confess two natures after it belongs also to those who dissolve the union, hear again the same Saint Cyril, what he says in the defense of the tenth anathematism against the reproofs of Theodoret: [CYRIL]: "How therefore do you say that the Word from God is united to Him who is from the seed of David, if you attribute the priesthood to Him alone who is from the seed of David? For if the union is true, they are not two at all, but one and only Christ is understood from both. Therefore it is evident that they indeed pretend to confess union, in order to seduce the minds of the simple; but they savor an adhesion, which is external, and habitual, which we also have had, shown to be partakers of His nature through the Spirit<sup><a href="#fn95" id="ref95">95</a></sup>."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Again the adversaries say: Behold Proclus, bishop of Constantinople, said, in the oration on the nativity of Christ, concerning the God-bearer Mary: "workshop of the union of natures<sup><a href="#fn96" id="ref96">96</a></sup>"; and again: "Seeing whose conjunction of natures Thomas exclaimed, saying: My Lord and my God<sup><a href="#fn97" id="ref97">97</a></sup>"; and again: "The natures came together and the union remained unconfused<sup><a href="#fn98" id="ref98">98</a></sup>." But we say to him who brings this forth: We will not allow you to seduce the simple by the plural appellation of natures. For we also say that Christ is from two natures and that the coition and conjunction and union of natures show us one incarnate nature of the Word.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">For union now does not permit two to be two, but one from both perfected through composition, as has been shown above. I will also bring forward Proclus himself to you as a witness of these assertions. For he writes in his letter to the Armenians thus: [PROCLUS]: "We say therefore, using each scriptural utterance, that the Word became flesh and took the form of a servant, and each piously understood is for us a seed of salvation. For through that 'became,' the evangelist shows the indivisibility of the supreme union: for as a monad is not divided into two monads—for divided into those, it would not be a monad, but a dyad—so that which is one according to the supreme union, is now not divided into two. Moreover, that 'took' proclaims the immutability [of the nature]<sup><a href="#fn99" id="ref99">99</a></sup>, evidently of the nature of God the Word."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Nor may you tell me that Proclus did not speak both these and the preceding things in the same oration, but these in one, and those in another: for this is most foolish and most audacious. For when those who say that the Lord was inhumanated according to fantasy bring forward those things which are written by the Apostle to the Philippians, in support of their madness, and corrupt those very things which were soundly said, and say the statements "made in the likeness of men and found in fashion as a man<sup><a href="#fn100" id="ref100">100</a></sup>" and "taking the form of a servant<sup><a href="#fn101" id="ref101">101</a></sup>" as a certain similitude and image and fantasy, we do not yield to them if they refuse to learn the sense of the words and the mystery of the dispensation from another epistle, but we produce for them from the epistle to Timothy this statement: "One mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus<sup><a href="#fn102" id="ref102">102</a></sup>," and from the epistle to the Hebrews: "Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He Himself likewise partook of the same<sup><a href="#fn103" id="ref103">103</a></sup>."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Certainly, but behold Saint John, who was bishop of Constantinople, explaining the statement "the Word became flesh<sup><a href="#fn104" id="ref104">104</a></sup> and dwelt among us," says: [JOHN]: "But that which dwells is not the same as that in which it dwells, but one thing dwells in another; otherwise it would not be a dwelling: for nothing dwells in itself<sup><a href="#fn105" id="ref105">105</a></sup>." How therefore will someone not say one Christ is two natures, if one thing is and another? But again we will persuade them not to cut off statements, but from those which are brought forth afterwards to recognize the negation of duality. For he adds: "But I said 'another' according to substance. For by union and adherence God the Word and His flesh are one, not by confusion or corruption of substances, but by a certain ineffable and inexplicable union, and that which He alone knows<sup><a href="#fn106" id="ref106">106</a></sup>." That the union of substances or natures exhibited one incarnate nature of the Word, has been shown sufficiently in the preceding.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">If indeed they again say: Behold John says, in the oration on Christ's ascension: [JOHN]: "Therefore let us all exult, seeing our firstfruits seated in the heavenly places and our nature having attained the throne at the right hand of God<sup><a href="#fn107" id="ref107">107</a></sup>," not even thus will we agree with them dividing one Christ into two natures. For in the Word of God who was incarnate in flesh consubstantial with us, our whole nature, that is, the whole human race, as in the firstfruits, in Christ, has been deemed worthy of royal and lofty seats; and that the matter is so, the same wise John shows in the same oration saying thus: [JOHN]: "For we who were not worthy even of the lower principality, have ascended to the supernal kingdom above all kingdoms; we have passed through the heavens; we have seized the royal throne; and the nature for which the Cherub was guarding paradise, itself sits today above the Cherubim<sup><a href="#fn108" id="ref108">108</a></sup>." According to this sentiment, in the same oration, he says also another thing, which is thus: [JOHN]: "Since therefore He Himself indeed was God angry, but we also thus were turned away from the benign Lord, Christ threw Himself as a mediator and gathered each nature into friendship<sup><a href="#fn109" id="ref109">109</a></sup>." And he said this most rightly: for because He is mediator of God and men and from two natures, namely from divinity and from humanity, Emmanuel is one, He reconciled human nature, that is, the whole human race, to the Father, who is in the heavens.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">This is the fortress of your authorities. While you corrupt them and explain them as it pleases you, and deceive the simple by the mention of natures, from which the one Christ is, you wickedly say: "If two natures are gathered among themselves and united, it is necessary therefore that we say this one acknowledged Christ is two natures": nor do you hear Saint Cyril saying: [CYRIL]: "For if the union is true, they are not two at all, but one Christ is understood from both<sup><a href="#fn110" id="ref110">110</a></sup>"; AND AGAIN, in another place: "But after the union, we no longer divide the natures from each other, nor do we cut that one and indivisible into two sons, but we say one Son and, as the Fathers said, one nature of the incarnate Word<sup><a href="#fn111" id="ref111">111</a></sup>"; AND AGAIN: "so that those two natures are now not two, but from both one animal is perfected<sup><a href="#fn112" id="ref112">112</a></sup>"; AND AGAIN: "Cease to divide the natures after the union<sup><a href="#fn113" id="ref113">113</a></sup>." And he explains in the same oration what it is "not to divide," saying: "From one person therefore all things are said: for one nature is conceived after the union, namely the nature of the incarnate Word Himself<sup><a href="#fn114" id="ref114">114</a></sup>."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">You also pass over the words of Gregory saying: [GREGORY]: "One thing indeed and another are those things from which our Savior is—since indeed that which cannot be seen is not the same as that which can be seen, and that which is free from time is not the same as that which is subject to time—but not one person and another, far be it! For both these are one by commixture<sup><a href="#fn115" id="ref115">115</a></sup>." And again, in the oration on the nativity of Christ: "But God proceeded with the assumption, one from two mutually contrary things<sup><a href="#fn116" id="ref116">116</a></sup>." Moreover, when you hear the testimonies of Theodotus, bishop of Ancyra, you seem to me to close your ears, lest you notice what he says: [THEODOTUS]: "That which is united, is not now called two, but one<sup><a href="#fn117" id="ref117">117</a></sup>," and: "That which is united, is inseparably one, and now does not become two<sup><a href="#fn118" id="ref118">118</a></sup>"; likewise Proclus, saying thus: [PROCLUS]: "That which has been made one according to the supreme union, is now not divided into two<sup><a href="#fn119" id="ref119">119</a></sup>."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">That all the God-bearing Fathers also spoke concerning His inhumanation as of one nature of the incarnate God the Word, in no way caring for accusations of theopaschism fabricated by you, nor inquiring, as the foolish Leo says, which nature hung on the wood of the cross<sup><a href="#fn120" id="ref120">120</a></sup>, to show, I will now set before you a gathering of their testimonies.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">OF IGNATIUS THEOPHORUS AND MARTYR; FROM THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS: "Allow me to be an imitator of the passion of my God<sup><a href="#fn121" id="ref121">121</a></sup>."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">OF IRENAEUS, BISHOP OF LYONS IN GAUL, WHO WAS NEAR THE TIME OF THE APOSTLES: "The Law and the Prophets and the Gospels preached that Christ was born of the Virgin and suffered on the cross and was seen from the dead and ascended into heaven and was glorified by the Father and reigns forever, and that He is the perfect mind and Word of God, who was born before the morning star and is creator of all and fashioner of man<sup><a href="#fn122" id="ref122">122</a></sup>."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">OF ALEXANDER, BISHOP OF THE ALEXANDRIANS, WHO WAS PRESIDENT OF THE HOLY SYNOD OF NICAEA: "What necessity therefore was there that God come to earth and be incarnated from the Virgin and be wrapped in swaddling clothes and placed in a manger and be nourished with milk in the bosom of His mother and be baptized in the Jordan and be mocked by the wicked and be suspended on the cross, and be buried in the earth and rise from the dead on the third day, and the rest<sup><a href="#fn123" id="ref123">123</a></sup>."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">OF JULIUS, BISHOP OF ROME; FROM THE ORATION AGAINST THOSE WHO ATTACK THE DIVINE INCARNATION UNDER THE PRETEXT OF THE CONSUBSTANTIAL: "And the Virgin from the beginning when she bore flesh, bore the Word and became Theotokos; and the Jews, when they crucified the body, crucified God; and no separation of the Word and His flesh appears in the divine Scriptures; but there is one nature, one operation, one person, wholly God, wholly man the same<sup><a href="#fn124" id="ref124">124</a></sup>." If therefore there is one operation, how does Leo say, in his Tome: [LEO]: "For each form operates with the communion of the other that which is proper, the Word working what is of the Word, but the body executing what is of the body<sup><a href="#fn125" id="ref125">125</a></sup>"? For if each of these forms operates properly, then other is the communion of those things which are separated according to nature, also according to the rationale of the dispensation, just as Saint Cyril says, in the defense of the third anathematism against the reproofs of Andreas, thus: [CYRIL]: "Communion however is not of one, but certainly of two or many, considered properly and separately<sup><a href="#fn126" id="ref126">126</a></sup>."</p>

    <p class="paragraph">OF SAINT ATHANASIUS, BISHOP OF ALEXANDRIA; FROM THE ORATION ON THE CROSS: "The Jews therefore were mocking our Lord, saying: 'If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.' But our Savior, who truly is the Son of God, not by fleeing death, but by awaiting death and, while awaiting it, trampling it, willed to be known to be the Son of God and to be life. For He who had raised others from the dead, could descend from the cross, but His descent seemed to be an escape from death; but that He remained on the cross, that signified nothing else, except that He who remained is life. AND AFTER OTHER THINGS: "But this by no means turned out according to the devil's intention: for behold, by that very death which the devil was afraid to bring about, the Lord died, and thus he was despoiled, and thinking he held Christ in death, he himself was rather caught dead, and what he gloried in as having plotted against man, he brought about so that God might be recognized. For as soon as He died, creation indeed was deprived of the sun, and the veil of the temple was torn, the earth shook, the rocks were split, the soldiers with the gatekeepers of hell grew faint with terror. From these things it was to be seen that it was not a man but truly God in the body, as even the spectators themselves said: 'Truly this is the Son of God.' For also many tombs were opened and those who lay dead in them rose up."<sup><a href="#fn127" id="ref127">127</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">OF SAINT BASIL, BISHOP OF CAESAREA IN CAPPADOCIA; FROM THE EPISTLE TO AMPHILOCHIUS, BISHOP OF ICONIUM, CONCERNING THE HOLY SPIRIT: "For neither the heaven and earth and the vastness of the seas, nor those things which dwell in the waters, nor the beasts of the earth, nor plants, stars, air, seasons, and the manifold adornment of the universe so demonstrate the excellence of virtue, as this, that the incomprehensible God was able [impassibly] to be involved in death through the flesh, so that He might bestow impassibility upon us through His passion."<sup><a href="#fn128" id="ref128">128</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">OF THE SAME; FROM THE HOMILY ON ENVY: "Why was He envied? On account of miracles? But what were those miracles? Healing of the sick: the hungry were fed and He who fed was attacked; the dead were raised, and envious was He who gave them life; demons were driven out, and He who commanded them was sought with snares; lepers were cleansed, the lame walked, the deaf heard, the blind saw and the Benefactor was driven away; and finally they handed over the Giver of life to death, they scourged with whips the Liberator of men and condemned the Judge of the world."<sup><a href="#fn129" id="ref129">129</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">OF THE SAME; FROM THE HOMILY ON THE MARTYR JULITTA AND ON THANKSGIVING: "And what need is there to recount small things? For you God is among men; for the sake of corrupt flesh the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us; beneficent to the ungrateful; a liberator to captives; a sun of righteousness to those sitting in darkness; impassible on the cross; life in death; light in hell; resurrection for the fallen."<sup><a href="#fn130" id="ref130">130</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">OF GREGORY, BISHOP OF NYSSA: "You see the measure of voluntary lowliness: Life also tastes death; the Judge is led to the tribunal; the Lord of all existing beings comes to the sentence of a judge; the King of all supramundane virtues does not repel from Himself the hands of executioners. To this example let the measure of humility of mind look for you."<sup><a href="#fn131" id="ref131">131</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">OF GREGORY THE THEOLOGIAN, BISHOP OF NAZIANZUS; FROM THE SECOND ORATION CONCERNING THE SON: "That saying also seems to me to be of this kind: 'My God, my God, look upon me, why have you forsaken me?' For He was not, as some think, forsaken either by the Father or by His own divinity, as if it feared suffering and withdrew from the sufferer: for who compelled Him either first to be born below, or to ascend the cross? But He, as I said, represented in Himself that which is ours. For we were the ones who had been forsaken before, but now are taken up and saved through the passion of the Impassible."<sup><a href="#fn132" id="ref132">132</a></sup> OF THE SAME; FROM THE FUNERAL ORATION ON HIS FATHER: "He was laboring therefore and the time of illness was the holy and notable Pascha: the day, king of days, and the splendid night, which dissolves the darkness of sin, in which we celebrate our Savior with abundant light and, dying with the light that died for us, we are raised with it when it is raised."<sup><a href="#fn133" id="ref133">133</a></sup> OF THE SAME; FROM THE SECOND ORATION ON PASCHA: "Nowhere let your mind waver when you hear of the blood and passion and death of God; nowhere impiously fluctuate, as if a defender of God, but without shame and hesitation eat the body and drink the blood, if you are held by desire for life."<sup><a href="#fn134" id="ref134">134</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">OF THE SAME, FROM THE SAME ORATION: "We needed God incarnate and dying, that we might live; we died with Him, that we might be purified; we rose with Him, because we died with Him; we are glorified with Him, because we rose with Him. But many were the miracles of that time: God crucified, the sun darkened and again inflamed: for it was fitting that the creatures also suffer with their Creator."<sup><a href="#fn135" id="ref135">135</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">OF SAINT JOHN, BISHOP OF CONSTANTINOPLE; FROM THE THIRD ORATION ON THE PRIESTHOOD: "But when you see the Lord sacrificed and lying down, and the priest bending over the sacrifice and praying, and the lips of all reddened by this blood, do you still think you are among men and standing on earth? Do you not immediately transfer into heaven and, with all carnal thought expelled from your soul, with naked soul and pure mind do you not look around at the things which are in the heavens? O miracle! O kindness of God! He who sits on high with the Father, at that hour is held in the hands of all and gives Himself to those willing to embrace and kiss Him."<sup><a href="#fn136" id="ref136">136</a></sup> OF THE SAME; FROM THE EIGHTH ORATION OF THE COMMENTARY ON THE SECOND EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS: "But what did the Apostles, unlettered and unlearned, say to persuade? Be baptized in the name of the Crucified. Of whom? Of Him whom they had not seen nor known. Nevertheless, saying these things they persuaded them, and preaching that those who were prophesying and had been handed down to them by their ancestors were not gods, but that He who had been affixed with nails was Himself God, they attracted all."<sup><a href="#fn137" id="ref137">137</a></sup> OF THE SAME; FROM THE SEVENTEENTH INTERPRETATION OF THE SAME EPISTLE: "For the ineffable, inconceivable, invisible, incomprehensible, who has ineffable glory, inaccessible light, immense majesty—for this is that: 'though He was rich'—became poor, became man, condemned, crucified, suffered many evils."<sup><a href="#fn138" id="ref138">138</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">OF SAINT ATTICUS, BISHOP OF CONSTANTINOPLE; FROM THE ORATION ON THE NATIVITY: "Today our Lord Christ received the birth of kindness; for He pre-existed in divine dignity." AFTERWARDS HE ADDS TO THESE: "The Word of kindness is emptied, though His nature is not capable of emptying: for He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant. The Expression of flesh is incarnated for you: for the Word was made flesh. He who is not tangible on account of the incorporeality of His nature, is touched. Lacking beginning, He is subjected to a bodily beginning. The Perfect grows; the Unchangeable makes progress; the Rich becomes [a guest] in an inn; He who covers the heaven with clouds is covered with swaddling bands; the King is placed in a manger."<sup><a href="#fn139" id="ref139">139</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">OF SAINT AMPHILOCHIUS, BISHOP OF ICONIUM: "For since He is both King and God, and on account of the dispensation of His passion tasted death, the gifts of the mysteries are indicative. Therefore they offer gold: for they acknowledge Him to be King; they offer frankincense, for they offer to God; they add also myrrh, on account of that mortality of His passion in mystery."<sup><a href="#fn140" id="ref140">140</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">OF SAINT PROCLUS, BISHOP OF CONSTANTINOPLE; FROM THE ORATION ON CHRIST'S NATIVITY ACCORDING TO THE FLESH: "The same in the bosom of the Father and in the womb of the Virgin; in the arms of the mother and upon the wings of the wind; adored by Angels and reclining with tax collectors. He, whom the Seraphim did not dare to look upon, Pilate interrogated; a servant struck Him with blows and creation trembled; He was affixed to the cross and the throne was not deserted by Him; He was enclosed in the tomb and heaven spread out like a tent; He was counted among the dead and despoiled hell; below He was called a seducer by calumny and above He was glorified as holy."<sup><a href="#fn141" id="ref141">141</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">OF SAINT THEOPHILUS, BISHOP OF ALEXANDRIA; FROM THE EIGHTEENTH FESTAL LETTER: "But by saying that the gatekeepers of hell saw Him and trembled, he explains the passage of His manifestation, which illuminated those sitting in the region and shadow of death, and by saying they trembled, he signifies a prodigy. For the heavenly King is also appearing there and He illuminates with the magnificent light of His divinity even the sad region of the souls which had descended into hell."<sup><a href="#fn142" id="ref142">142</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">OF SAINT CYRIL, BISHOP OF ALEXANDRIA; FROM THINGS HE WROTE AGAINST THEODORE: "Does it seem a small thing to you that the Lord of glory was affixed to the wood, whom you say is neither the true Son nor God, but we believe to be truly the Son and God, creator and author of all things. For He was not simply a man, but the Word, that which is from God and the Father, in our form, not having suffered change or conversion into flesh, but rather united to it according to the faith of the holy Scriptures. He Himself, who suffered in the flesh and hung on the wood, performed miracles in Egypt through the most wise Moses, renewing His glory."<sup><a href="#fn143" id="ref143">143</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Behold, all the Doctors of the Church know the incarnate God to be He who suffered for us, but they do not attribute the passion separately and individually to the human nature, since they have handed down that there is one incarnate nature of the Word. But if you ask me how from two there is one and unconfused nature, and how the impassible God suffers in the flesh, again I will bring forth to you the God-inspired voice of the Fathers, and not say things that proceed from my own heart, and I will clearly show you that the union, which is from two natures, results in one incarnate nature of the Word. Hear therefore what Saint Cyril says, in the oration on the fact that Christ is one, which he wrote through question and answer, putting forward another person: [CYRIL]: "B. Are they therefore confused with each other and made one nature? — A. But who would be so stupid and unlearned as to think that either the divine nature of the Word was changed into what it was not, or that the flesh was translated according to the mode of change into the nature of the Word? For this is impossible. But we say that He is one Son, and His one nature, even though He is acknowledged to have been made in the assumption of flesh having a rational soul. For His, as I said, is the humanity; but He is conceived by us in no other way than as God and man simultaneously."<sup><a href="#fn144" id="ref144">144</a></sup> AND AFTER A FEW THINGS: "Indeed, most superfluously, O friend, babbles he who says that confusion and mixture occur, if we proclaim one nature of the Son, namely incarnate and inhumanated. For no one could demonstrate this with necessary and true syllogisms. But if they establish their own will as law for us, they have devised a plan which they cannot establish. For we must attend not to them, but rather to the God-inspired Scripture. If indeed they think that, because human nature is nothing if compared to the divine excellence, it is necessary that it be snatched away and vanish, as they speak, again we will say to them: 'You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.' For it was not impossible for the kind God to show Himself tolerable within human measures. And He mystically prefigured this, initiating Moses and as if still describing the mode of inhumanation in types. For He descended in the form of fire into the bush in the desert; and the fire emitted flashes in the plant, yet it was not consumed. And Moses marveled at the vision. But how is wood not alien to fire? And how did the material, which can easily be ignited, sustain the onslaught of the flame? But it was, as I said, this thing a type of the mystery, which showed that the divine nature of the Word would be tolerable within human measures, He Himself willing. For nothing at all is impossible for Him. — B. Know well that they do not wish to think such things. — A. The discourse made by them will therefore be discovered proclaiming to us without doubt two sons and two christs."<sup><a href="#fn145" id="ref145">145</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Behold, he has manifestly decreed that those who do not confess one incarnate nature of the Son are without doubt of the opinion that there are two sons and christs. Again, however, the same Cyril says in the same oration: [CYRIL]: "But how does the same one, by suffering, not suffer? — A. He suffered in His own flesh, but not in the nature of the divinity; and the discourse concerning these things is utterly ineffable, nor can the mind perceive such subtle and lofty thoughts. But we, adhering to reasonings which lead to rectitude and illustrating the discourse of rectitude, neither make Him alien to that which is said to have been suffered, lest we also say that even the preceding generation according to the flesh was not His, but rather of some other, nor do we establish that the things which are of the flesh were made into His divine and exalted nature. But let it be understood, as I said, that He suffered in His own flesh, even though He did not suffer in His deity. But in what manner? Indeed, the whole power of examples fails and is inferior to the truth. Yet it brings to mind a certain subtle imagination of the thing, and elevates it in a certain way from those things which are at hand to that which is exalted and above reason. For just as iron, or other material of this kind, when it is occupied by the forces of fire, indeed receives the fire and suffers the flame: but if it should happen to be struck by someone, the material itself indeed receives damage, but the nature of the fire is in no way injured by the striker: so in a certain way also when the Son is said to have suffered in the flesh, but not to have suffered in His divinity. And indeed small, as I said, is the force of examples, but it leads in a certain way to a proximity of the truth those who have not preferred not to apply faith to the sacred Scriptures."<sup><a href="#fn146" id="ref146">146</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">We, who are accused of theopaschism spread against us, think thus, and follow the theological Fathers, believing that God suffered in the flesh for the world, but not by inquiring which nature hung on the wood of the cross: for this belongs to those who cut the one Christ into two. For if the union is true, we do not say that one Christ is acknowledged in two natures, even if someone says there is a unity of nature. For he falsely asserts the union who says two after the union: for the hypostatic union does not admit division into two. For indeed, if two remained, Christ is dissected, not united; if indeed united, He ceased to be two and is one according to the composition, showing in Himself also those things from which He is, because He is not united through confusion, and He cannot be two on account of the indissoluble union. For we have heard from the words of the Fathers that that which is indissolubly united is one and does not become two again. Therefore let not those who say, 'You anathematize the Fathers: for they also said a union of natures,' frighten us. For neither do we deny this, but the union of natures has demonstrated to us one incarnate nature of the Son.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore we anathematize those who indeed say union, but again call those things which have been once united "two united into a union." Therefore do not, as if preparing weapons, construct such contradictions against us. For neither did Theodoret prevent Saint Cyril from anathematizing those who called Christ a deified man, since not only once, but even twice and thrice he brought forward the great Basil saying deified flesh, but not a deified man. Nor, when we anathematize without that fear those who speak of mixture concerning the inhumanation of the Word, do we now also anathematize the Fathers who used this very word: Gregory indeed saying: "O new tempering! O marvelous mixture!"; and Julius writing: "For one and the same is the body and God whose body it is, not with His flesh changed into that which is without body, but having also that which is proper to Him from us according to generation from the Virgin and that which is above us, according to the mixture or union of God the Word"; and Cyril similarly saying: "But rather with things concurring into natural union and as if mingling with each other whatever was proper to each."<sup><a href="#fn147" id="ref147">147</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore let not those who say two natures provide a cause for those who dissect Christ, nor let them bring forth the Fathers to us in the middle, perversely understanding their words. For neither did they who undertook the patronage of the blasphemous writings of Theodore, the teacher of Nestorius, accomplish anything by saying that his writings should not be blamed, lest also the writings of Basil and Gregory and other deified Fathers similar to those be blamed. For you see what Saint Cyril wrote to Acacius of Melitene, in the epistle whose beginning is: 'The chaste and religious deacon and archimandrite Maximus': [CYRIL]: "But the Orientals have written that the things which are Theodore's ought not to be blamed, lest of course also the things which are of blessed Athanasius and Theophilus and Basil and Gregory be blamed: for the things which Theodore spoke, those very things they also spoke. But I, writing these things, did not endure it, but confidently said that Theodore indeed had a blasphemous tongue and a pen serving it, but they were teachers of all orthodoxy and shone in these things."<sup><a href="#fn148" id="ref148">148</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, considering all these things, cease to say that two natures and two forms are one Christ after you have confessed the union: for this belongs to those who contradict their own words. For behold, Theodoret and Andreas, saying a union of natures, and dividing the mystery of the dispensation, have been caught, and therefore we do not say that they were wise with opinions similar to those of the Fathers.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And hear what Andreas says, in the reprehension of the fourth anathematism: [ANDREAS]: "But with the supreme union preserved and one Son and Christ and Lord proclaimed, the things which are said must be accepted concerning one and the same Son; nevertheless, it is fitting to adapt the things which are said to the one Son according to the power of the united natures."<sup><a href="#fn149" id="ref149">149</a></sup> AND AFTER A FEW THINGS: "Shall we say piously, with the natures remaining unconfused and an inseparable union proclaimed, that we adapt the expressions according to the power of the united natures, as has been said, truly into one Son and Lord and Christ, but not contracting all into one nature?"<sup><a href="#fn150" id="ref150">150</a></sup> Pay attention how, when he says an individual union of natures, he refuses to say one nature. How therefore do the adversaries say that to say "two natures united" or "individual" and "one incarnate nature" is the same? Again the same Andreas says in the reprehension of the tenth anathematism: [ANDREAS]: "For that 'Son' after the union is one in both natures, since the natures are not separated from each other. For no separation has been made after the union: for the union remains forever. Nay, even in the passions of the flesh the divinity was inseparable, remaining impassible, and was accomplishing through the flesh the things which befit God: whence we confess one and the same Son, the natures remaining unconfused, not saying one and another, far be it! but one and the same. Therefore, that He was made our Pontiff and Apostle, according to the Scriptures, our Lord and God Jesus Christ, no one will deny, yet not a separate man, who is from a woman, from the Word, which is from the Father, so that that which is from the seed of David is unconfusedly and ineffably and inseparably united to the Word begotten from the Father."<sup><a href="#fn151" id="ref151">151</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Hear also what Theodoret says in his contradiction to the third anathematism: [THEODORETUS]: "To confess one person and similarly one Son and Christ is pious; but to say two hypostases or natures united is not absurd, but according to the cause consistent."<sup><a href="#fn152" id="ref152">152</a></sup> AGAIN, IN THE REPREHENSION OF THE FIFTH anathematism: [THEODORETUS]: "But we call Christ 'a deified man,' not as one who has received some particular divine grace, but 'as one who has the whole divinity of the Son united to himself.'"<sup><a href="#fn153" id="ref153">153</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">AGAIN THE SAME IN THE REPREHENSION OF THE SEVENTH anathematism: [THEODORETUS]: "How was the form of the servant not glorified through the form of God? For if, since by its nature it is mortal, it has been made immortal on account of the union to God the Word, it has received what it did not have."<sup><a href="#fn154" id="ref154">154</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, shall we declare them innocent, because they say an individual and supreme and indissoluble and eternal union, or shall we rather turn our face away from them, because they say two natures even after the union, and they contradict their own words, and they incline to either side, just as also Saint Cyril says, in the defense of the tenth anathematism against the reprehensions of Andreas: [CYRIL]: "It must again be said opportunely by us to the adversaries: 'How long will you limp on both your knees?' For you ought to have a sound and whole mind for the right knowledge of the dogmas of piety, not one limping with duplicity of soul and laboring greatly with weakness and unwilling to walk rightly. For 'a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways, and will receive nothing from the Lord.'"<sup><a href="#fn155" id="ref155">155</a></sup> And very fittingly Saint Cyril says these things to them, blaming the perversity of those evil men: for these same marvelous heralds of the union of two natures, see how they divide the mystery of the dispensation into two persons and two christs and sons in the same reprehensions of the anathematisms.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus Andreas says in the reprehension of the first anathematism: [ANDREAS]: "But the Magi, led by that star, came from Persia, seeking the newborn, and when they had found Him, they offered gifts suitable both to Him who was understood, and to Him who was seen."<sup><a href="#fn156" id="ref156">156</a></sup> AGAIN THE SAME, IN THE REPREHENSION OF THE TENTH anathematism: "Did God the Word offer prayers and supplications with a loud cry to Him who was able to save Him, and was heard because of His reverence, and learned obedience from the things which He suffered? If therefore God the Word was made a pontiff and learned from the things which He suffered, He Himself also was perfected."<sup><a href="#fn157" id="ref157">157</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">But also Theodoret cries out things similar to his words in the reprehension of the fourth anathematism; for thus he says: [THEODORETUS]: "Therefore, it is not of God the Word to be ignorant, but of the form of a servant, which knew at that time as much as the divinity dwelling in it revealed to it."<sup><a href="#fn158" id="ref158">158</a></sup> AND AGAIN THE SAME, IN THE REPREHENSION OF THE NINTH anathematism, SAYS THUS: [THEODORETUS]: "With those, he even dared to anathematize the archangel Gabriel: for he was the first to preach Christ according to the flesh, even before His very conception, to be born of the Holy Spirit."<sup><a href="#fn159" id="ref159">159</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, to these things and to the time, Saint Cyril says, in the defense of the fourth anathematism against the reprehensions of Theodoret: [CYRILLUS]: "But if it is true that He similarly partook of blood and flesh, and was made like to His brethren in all things, that is, to us, why do they foolishly carp at the skillful dispensation, not enduring the human voice and that which is held lowly in the expressions on account of the dispensation, as if to another Son existing separately, to the form of a servant, as they themselves say, they try to refer it? It is utterly foolish, however, for them to pretend indeed what they fear from the madnesses of heretics, and then to draw the tradition of right faith away from its suitable meaning. But I would say it is better and far more learned to refer the human expressions not to another person more properly understood, and a separate Son, to the form of a servant, as they are accustomed to say, but rather to attribute them to the measures of His humanity. For it was fitting for Him, since He is God and man simultaneously, to proceed through each kind of speech."<sup><a href="#fn160" id="ref160">160</a></sup> AND AFTER A FEW THINGS: "Therefore, if you do not lie in saying one Christ and Son and Lord, namely the same God and man simultaneously, why do you divide and are not ashamed to say two sons? Or will there not be plainly two, if indeed He who has measured knowledge is not the same as He who knows all things, and He who receives a partial revelation is not the same as He who is perfect in wisdom and knows all things which the Father also knows? And if indeed one and the same is on account of the matter of true union, and not one and another separately and apart, it will plainly be His both to know and also to seem not to know."<sup><a href="#fn161" id="ref161">161</a></sup> AND AGAIN IN THE DEFENSE of the NINTH anathematism: "Therefore, that Christ according to the flesh is one, and another Christ separately is again the Word from God the Father. Where then is the union, and what use is there from it, if there are two christs and each is understood and said properly and separately? Therefore, although for themselves, feigning a person of piety, they may say one Christ, let them hear from us, that in truth they think there are two: 'How long will you limp on both knees?' For it would have been better for us to walk straight, having a faith unpolluted and firm, not limping with foolish opinions."<sup><a href="#fn162" id="ref162">162</a></sup> AND AGAIN, IN THE DEFENSE of the TENTH anathematism: "When the lowliness consequent upon the emptying seems heavy to you, admire rather the love of the Son for us. For that which you call small, He voluntarily did for you. He wept humanly, to restrain your tear; He feared in the dispensation, allowing the flesh also at times to suffer what is proper to it, so that He might show us more courageous. He refused the cup so that the cross might accuse the impiety of the Jews. He is said to have been weakened in a human way, to abolish your weakness. He offered prayers and supplications, so that He might also show the Father's hearing favorable to prayers offered by you. [He slept], so that you might learn not to sleep in temptations, but rather to be earnest in prayers."<sup><a href="#fn163" id="ref163">163</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">By these words he refutes those who set forth to us an individual and unconfused union of natures and who, after they have said they are united, prove there are still two natures. Therefore, let not those who champion the Tome of Leo set forth to us as if something valid and great the formula: the divine nature is united to the passible nature; for they are shown not to confess a hypostatic union from two natures but to speak of a relational adherence of two persons, since they have said: "Therefore, with the property of each nature preserved and coming together into one person, lowliness was assumed by the divinity, but weakness by the power, mortality by immortality."<sup><a href="#fn164" id="ref164">164</a></sup> AND AGAIN: "For although in our Lord Jesus Christ there is rather one person of God and man."<sup><a href="#fn165" id="ref165">165</a></sup> For if God is one and man another, and not one and the same, it is very manifest that you introduce to us a union of persons, even if you maliciously make mention of 'person' in the singular, not 'persons' in the plural.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And Saint Cyril is a witness, who in his epistle to Nestorius exclaims: [CYRILLUS]: "But it in no way profits the right meaning of faith for it to be so, even if some disseminate a union of persons. For the divine Scripture did not say that the Word united to itself the person of a man, but that it was made flesh."<sup><a href="#fn166" id="ref166">166</a></sup> Again, in the epistle to Valerian: "Then tell me, where now is one person? For they pretend to say one person of Christ, but with two hypostases placed singularly and separately, there will plainly also be two persons. Truly we enter as legislators establishing that which pleases them as being right and altogether sound. For they say: 'Separating the hypostases, we unite the person.' And how is that not incredible and unlearned and impossible?"<sup><a href="#fn167" id="ref167">167</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">I do not divide the hypostases, but I say they are united. For if they are united, one has been made from both according to the composition, unchangeably and unconfusedly in the manner which He Himself knows. But he who says there is one hypostasis, but two natures after the union — which the Chalcedonians said for the deception of the simple — is similar to him who says the same thing is one and two, and falls into a contradiction more foolish than all fools. For he who says one hypostasis will necessarily also say one incarnate nature of the Word, just as has already been shown above.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">HERE ENDS THE SECOND ORATION TO NEPHALIUM OF SAINT SEVERUS, PATRIARCH OF ANTIOCH; TRANSLATED, HOWEVER, FROM GREEK INTO SYRIAC BY CASTOR THE PRESBYTER, ATHANASIUS OF NISIBIS.</p>
