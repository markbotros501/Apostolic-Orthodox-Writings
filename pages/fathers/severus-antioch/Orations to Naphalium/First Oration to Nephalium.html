    <h1>ORATIONS OF SAINT SEVERUS, PATRIARCH OF ANTIOCH, TO NEPHALIUM</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">[FIRST ORATION]</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But from those things which I wrote to Nephalius, I will bring forth a part into the open... It is written thus: THE PATRIARCH'S words, from the orations TO NEPHALIUM: "Nor should you say to me again in that voice that some of the Fathers used the expression 'of two natures'; for they did not use it in your sense, even if we grant this assertion. For at the time of Saint Cyril, when the disease of Nestorius’ vain talk was raging in the churches, that expression was mostly rejected; for remedies are for diseases. Therefore, the expressions of other Fathers, if they are found—as I say again by way of conjecture—cannot be brought forward against Saint Cyril, who found the remedy against the invading disease; indeed, I say more: even if they are expressions of Cyril himself spoken previously. For if an eminent physician, when a deadly disease invades some city, prohibits the drinking of water, no one can come forward and say to him: 'Behold, the physicians of our Fathers allowed the drinking of water; indeed, you yourself, in the preceding year, did not forbid us from drinking water.' For he would rightly say to him: 'Fool! Do you not see the disease, on account of which harm comes to those who drink water, but from good health you wish to establish a norm for a pernicious condition?'"<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">...those things also which are contained in the orations which I wrote to Nephalius, the Grammarian dares to censure foolishly. They are as follows: THE PATRIARCH, FROM THE ORATIONS TO NEPHALIUM: "Again, after the excision of Nestorius, it is subject to censure to say that Christ is double, because he said: NESTORIUS: 'I distinguish double natures in Christ: for they are double according to nature, but single according to dignity.' Therefore, Cyril also appears saying in his letter to Nestorius: CYRIL: 'Moreover, we do not distribute the words spoken in the Gospel concerning our Savior to two hypostases, nor to two persons; for the one and only Christ is not double, although he is understood to have coalesced from two things into an indivisible unity, just as also man is understood to be constituted from soul and body, yet he is not double, but rather one from both.'<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> And again, in the books Against the Blasphemies of Nestorius, in the second tome, he says: CYRIL: 'For it is not because the Word, which is from God, when it assumed flesh, appeared as a man like us, that he is also to be called double.'<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Nevertheless, Gregory Nazianzen seems to have used this expression irreprehensibly in his oration on the nativity of Christ, saying: GREGORY NAZIANZEN: 'He was sent indeed, but as man; for he is double'<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, after he had said a little before: 'But God proceeding with the assumption, one from two contraries.'<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>"</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For I wrote in the orations to Nephalius: THE PATRIARCH TO NEPHALIUM: "After the vain talk of Nestorius, it is liable to suspicion to say: 'God the Word assumed a man', just as Saint Cyril also said in his first letter to Succensus: 'Therefore he became man, he did not assume a man, as pleased Nestorius.'<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> Nevertheless, Gregory Nazianzen rightly used this expression in his letter to Cledonius. For when he composed the whole letter against the ill-omened Apollinarius, who asserted that the flesh of the Lord was without mind, wishing to show that all those things of which man consists were assumed by God the Word, he said thus: GREGORY NAZIANZEN: '...first indeed not a man, but God and Son alone and older than the ages, not mixed with body nor with all that belongs to the body, but in the end also a man assumed for our salvation.'<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Moreover, it is known to all that the expressions differ nothing from each other as far as the sense is concerned."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For when the foolish Nephalius and his companions, defenders of the Council of Chalcedon, said that this council, fighting against the phantasy of Eutyches, used crude words, I applied the same objection in those things which I wrote to him, thus: THE PATRIARCH, FROM THE WRITING TO NEPHALIUM: "What, then, is their chaste word to them?" THE PATRIARCH HIMSELF, AS FROM THE PERSON OF THE HERETICS: "When they wished, they say, to root out the opinion of the phantasy of Eutyches, but in no way favored the opposite party, they spoke thus: for this is the custom of those who fight against heresies." THE PATRIARCH HIMSELF AGAINST THE HERETICS: "But I will say to them: O good men, someone says this fittingly: when some question arises, he who fights against this question does not, on the other hand, observe his speech concerning any matter about which at this time absolutely no question is being raised."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I will append the following things which I wrote to Nephalius... Moreover, the following things are thus: THE PATRIARCH HIMSELF, FROM THOSE THINGS TO NEPHALIUM: "For example, pardon is rightly granted to the Fathers fighting against the impurity of Arius, because they often spoke more crudely concerning the incarnation of the Lord, because at that time absolutely no question was being moved concerning it. That they spoke more crudely I say with regard to one or another expression; not that any Father fell into a reprobate sense in all his words, as the followers of Diodorus and Theodore did, but because, when a dispute arises at this very time, for example of Arius and Sabellius, it is possible to find expressions of the Fathers standing as if on a balanced scale. The Fathers never inclined to either side, but they avoided all deflection and proceeded as if on a royal way. And you may see what Gregory the Theologian says in the first of the orations on divinity: THE PASSAGE OF GREGORY NAZIANZEN, WHICH THE PATRIARCH BROUGHT FORWARD IN THE WRITING TO NEPHALIUM: 'We adore the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, separating indeed the properties, but uniting the divinity; nor do we contract the three into one, lest we labor with the disease of Sabellius, nor do we divide them into three alien and diverse things, lest we rave with the insanity of Arius. For what necessity is there that, like a plant leaning to one side and inclined on all sides, we should by force bend it to the other side, correcting a distortion by a distortion, and not rather, directing it to the middle, stand within the limits of piety?'<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> So therefore it was fitting also that the letter of Leo, with both inquiries having arisen and growing strong and concerning the same matter, I mean the incarnation of the Lord, closing, by an inclination to one side, might not indeed seem to heal the other side of impiety, but falling into the first, and not by the whole arrangement of speech foster the song of two natures. For also the cause of Diodorus, pretending by saying that he fights against the Synousiasts—that is, against those who mixed the flesh of the Lord with divinity and foolishly said that it was converted into the substance of God—and having fallen to the opposite opinion, namely to say that the one Christ is two Sons, the wise Cyril rebukes, saying: CYRIL: 'Therefore we also consider Paul of Samosata worthy of a crown, who more accurately than you dissects the mystery of the economy.'<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>"</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For in those things which I wrote to Nephalius, I placed a passage of the divine Athanasius... and he says thus: ATHANASIUS: "For he who thought himself to be like God was deluded by a youth, and he who boasted against flesh and blood was conquered by a man bearing flesh. For the Lord, who bore flesh for us, helped him and gave victory to the body against the Slanderer."<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> Afterwards I added these words to the words of Saint Athanasius: "Behold how Athanasius placed words now about a man like us, now about the Lord. For just as we, who are said to be one something, are one nature of soul and body, but by no means one and another, in the same way also the Lord himself with his own flesh, evidently animated by a rational soul, without change also became one."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">...the Grammarian omitted to adulterate those things which are contained in this very oration written by me to Nephalius—For I appended a passage of the letter of Saint Cyril to the monks... in which these things are contained: CYRIL: "For the Word, his only-begotten, was begotten, as I said, from the substance of God and the Father. But because he assumed flesh and made it his own and was called the Son of Man and became like us, I think it is in no way absurd, but rather necessarily to be confessed, that he according to the flesh was born through a woman, just as also the soul of man is generated together with its proper body and is considered as one something with it, although by its nature it is understood and is diverse from it according to its proper reason. And if anyone wishes to say that the mother of someone is flesh-bearing, but not at the same time also soul-bearing, he utterly pours forth vain words. For she gave birth, as I said, to a living being elegantly composed from dissimilars, and consisting indeed from two, but truly one man, while each remains what it is; however, those two concur into a natural unity and as if mixed with each other what each had as proper."<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> To these, after I had appended them, I added thus: "You see that he handed down that he is to be understood as one from two, when he compared the inhumanation of our Savior to the constitution of every man, and did not allow a division into two, but preserved a union without confusion, saying: 'while each remained what it is, but those two concurred into a natural unity.'"</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And when I had written to Nephalius: "We are one something and one nature of both together, that is, soul and body: for this is man, one according to nature, that is, according to hypostasis, who is acknowledged to be the same according to substance."... For, in the oration to Nephalius... it is contained in these very words thus: "But adhering without adulteration to the doctrines of the divine Fathers, by the grace of God we are in a good opinion and stand upon the rock, confessing God the Word to have been incarnate from the holy God-bearer ever-virgin Mary and from the Holy Spirit, in flesh consubstantial with us animated by a rational and intelligent soul: for the Virgin, from whom the Holy Spirit formed this holy body, is consubstantial with us; for it was not from human seed, far be it. Therefore we confess the same one consubstantial with the Father according to divinity, and the same one consubstantial with us according to the inhumanation: we say the same, not another and another; for the things from which our Savior is are other and other, but not another and another. For from two natures we believe him to be one, that is, from perfect divinity and from perfect, without sin, humanity, without change, without confusion, no confusion or mixture having been made, as we said above." And again after a little: "If anyone says from heaven that the flesh of the Lord descended, or passed through the Virgin as through a channel, but does not say that it was formed from her according to the law of conception, although without a man, let him be anathema. For neither the conception, nor the birth from Mary, nor the conversation with men, nor the cross, nor the burial, nor the resurrection from the dead, nor the ascension into heaven happened according to phantasy, but all according to truth: for we who truly sinned needed true healing. Therefore we also expect Christ to come according to truth, in this very body in which he bore the saving passion of the cross; for thus he will be seen by those who pierced him.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> Nor indeed do we hold theopaschism in mind thus, far be it; but we say, as it is written, the Lord of glory suffered in the flesh.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> For although it is proper to the body to suffer, nevertheless the impassible Word was united to the body capable of passion; and because the body is his own, the passion also is said to be his. But neither without soul, nor without mind, but we believe the inhumanation of the Lord to be animated and endowed with mind and intellect. For we anathematize the phantasy of Eutyches and Valentinus, and the impiety of the Manichaeans, and the madness of Apollinarius, and the evil economy of division of Nestorius."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Moreover, these things were written by us to Christians for defense, not for contradiction. For we do not impose divine doctrines on impure ears, that they may judge us, nor again will we find illegitimate ears. For how will a Jew or pagan receive our holy things, to whom the cross is a scandal and derision?<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> And this discourse is not mine, but I invoke the law of Gregory the Theologian, rebuking the immodest and light manner of the Arians. For he says thus in the third oration on peace: GREGORY: "And at first indeed not even to speak some superfluous word was without danger,<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> but now we even lacerate the most religious with insults; and formerly it was not even permitted to read the law outside, nor confessions, that is, as it seems to me, to demand the assent of the people, but now we even employ profane judges concerning ineffable matters, casting holy things to dogs and throwing pearls before swine.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> Nor that alone, but we also feed their ears with mutual insults against ourselves: and we cannot even perceive that it is not safe to commit weapons to enemies, nor to him who hates Christians a discourse against Christians." Again in the oration against the Eunomians he said: GREGORIUS: "Let our contention also be legitimate. Why does a savage hearer of words hear generation and creation, and God from non-existents, and division and separation and resolution? Why do we make the accusers themselves judges? Why do we commit swords to enemies? How, do you think, will he who praises adulteries and corruptions of boys, and cultivates passions, who can think nothing above the body, who yesterday and the day before established gods for himself and those known by most shameful deeds, receive a discourse concerning these matters? Is it not crudely? Not foully? Not ignorantly? Not as usual? Will he not make the defense of his own gods and passions your theology? For if we ourselves calumniate these words, we will persuade them with difficulty to philosophize in our doctrines; and if they become from us themselves inventors of evils, when will they ever depart from traditions?"<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">These are the legislation of the Fathers; that we may follow them, we pray; thus we believe, thus we think; with this faith both to live is piety and to die is gain, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom to the Father with the Holy Spirit be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
