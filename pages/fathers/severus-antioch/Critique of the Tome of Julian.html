    <h1>Critique of the Tome of Julian</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: center;">EXPOSITION OF SAINT SEVERUS, ARCHBISHOP OF ANTIOCH, TO JULIAN, BISHOP OF HALICARNASSUS, WHICH BRINGS OUT HOW THE INSPIRED SCRIPTURES AND THE DOCTORS OF THE CHURCH, WHO HAVE INTERPRETED THEM IN THE SPIRIT, TEACH THE MANNER OF THINKING AND SPEAKING CONCERNING THE INCORRUPTIBILITY OF THE VERY HOLY BODY OF THE "GREAT GOD AND OUR SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST"<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">An apostolic law has been, from the origin, observed in the holy Church; it imposes on those who announce the gospel and on those who preach or teach the faith that it contains, the obligation to make it known and to reveal it mutually to each other, both with modesty and with discernment, and to maintain similarly a unique and common hope. This is what the great Paul did, who had been called from on high for the ministry of preaching and, for this very reason, gave himself the name of "called apostle"<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> — because he had not been counted from the beginning among the apostles, but the dignity of the apostleship had fallen to him with his vocation, and it is at the same time that he had been ranked among those who then believed in Christ and that he had also shone among the apostles by crowning that divine college. For he had received the testimony of him who had called him that alone, more than the others, he was able to bear "the name which is above every name"<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>; it is by this title that he had been named "vessel of election"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, because he had been capable of containing the rich and abundant influx of science, difficult to bear by others. — It is therefore he, this remarkable man, who, writing to the Galatians, said that he went up to Jerusalem, following a revelation, to the notable ones among the apostles, to manifest to them the Gospel (which he preached); he indicated moreover the cause of this step, declaring with a praiseworthy humility of spirit: "lest I be running, or had run, in vain."<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> He gave to the Corinthians also this same warning to be vigilant<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> and not to waver<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>. And he exhorted them still to not trust even in their own person, to not discover some novelty, and to not welcome any foreign teaching, but to consider attentively the model of his preaching and to examine according this norm every opinion, speaking to them in these terms: "Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves."<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">It is therefore to imitate this beautiful example of the teaching of the Word that the venerable pastors of the churches, who were the heirs of the apostles, have vied in zeal, and, concerning the problems which ceaselessly arose among them, in their apprehension and their great solicitude, they wrote to each other mutually. And to not speak of facts too far removed nor too distant from us, it is thus that Dionysius, who presided over the holy church of Alexandria, had written to his homonym, I mean to Dionysius, who, at that time, was, he also, at the feast of the spiritual flock of Rome, and before this one, to Cornelius and to Stephen, who had directed the same flock, when, after having received a response, he wrote to them again as if to bring remedy to the difficulties which had arisen before them. It is thus that Victor also, bishop of the church of the Corinthians, had written to the great (servant) of God Athanasius.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Following therefore their steps and obeying the law of the Church, your Holiness also wrote to me from the beginning to criticize those who declare in such an absolute manner that the body of "our great God and savior the Christ"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> is corruptible, and you also made known to me what you had been constrained to write to them on this subject; you asked that after having made the reading and the examination, a response be redacted to you on what must be thought in a firm and constant manner on this question.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For my part, I apprehend to speak! I fear that while feeling myself very far from it and eclipsed by the example of "these divine towers and these citadels of the truth"<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>, of these ministers of the pious word, this sole fact gives the impression that the illusion of glory draws me to compare myself to them without reserve. However that it is not without danger, for those who are ranked among the bishops, to keep silent on similar subjects, the servant described in the divine gospel has shown it: because he had been rather the servant of his indolence than of his master, that he had secretly buried his talent, he found himself, with bitterness and profound pain, stripped of the divine grace which had been accorded to him, and he was sent into the exterior darkness<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>. The holy Apostle proclaims without concealment: "This is a stewardship that has been entrusted to me," — thus he calls the ministry of the evangelical word, — "and woe to me if I do not announce it!"<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Given the extreme fear that we experience before the divine threat, it is necessary that with the prevenient action in us of the divine grace, from which emanate every healthy word and thought, and according to the feeble means which we have at our disposal, we proceed as briefly as possible and that we express a clear opinion on these subjects, fleeing all the violences of superfluous ideas, so as not to appear to discourse on something other than that which we had disposed ourselves to speak. It is necessary that we follow also, with the inspired (Scriptures), the chosen men and guardians of the Law, who were in the following times doctors of the mysteries of the holy Church, not only in their doctrines, but also in the terminology which expresses the doctrines, and that we repute true what they have said and false what they have not said. For, as for me, I admit to being conscious of my weakness; and in every circumstance of my life I have the care to regulate my spirit according to their terminology and their ideas and to conform my tongue to it, to have recourse to it in my language and my writings each time that the circumstances require it, and, to not recognize them on the one hand as Fathers, while rising on the other hand against their ineluctable declarations, which are the expression of the authentic doctrine. For it is not they who spoke, following the truthful word of our Savior, but the Spirit of their Father who spoke in them<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup> and made known to them what it was fitting to say and also what it was necessary to keep silent, following the snares that the evil ability of the heresies set for them, which leaves us absolutely nothing that is beyond criticism and discussion. Also it is of importance, assuredly, and even of great importance for our cure, all ranked as we are among the doctors, to seize and to say integrally and without alteration the fruit of their labor and of their discussions.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I pray therefore your Piety to not be offended by the fact that the exposition proceeds under the form of an inquiry and an examination, recommended by the truth, and not under that of a discussion of a controversial question. But perhaps it is in vain that I have formulated this request, since you had previously incited us to explore what you had written and not to reserve for it an reception of pure benevolence. Thus therefore we believe that, following the prayer of the Apostle, the peace of Christ will appease our hearts<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>, to us who seek the truth; and besides charity permits all, because it is the bond of perfection<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Who therefore ignores that all these eminent doctors have said, following the divine Scripture, that the Son of God and his Word, who is before the ages, has, at the end of times, become incarnate and made man of the Holy Spirit and of the Mother of God, Mary, ever Virgin, outside of all change and all alteration? We understand that he united himself hypostatically to a flesh, endowed with an intelligent soul, — elements of which our humanity is also constituted, — to the exclusion of sin, which is not considered as inherent to the constitution and to human nature, since it is a weakness and a sickness of the spirit which has deviated, by the play of its free will, towards illicit concupiscence. For it is affected, he also, by this infirmity, and because his preoccupations had turned away towards voluptuousness, that Adam let himself be vanquished by the savor of the fruit of the tree which was forbidden to him!</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now an infirmity being a defect of health, that infirmity also is an alteration of a spirit which has diluted the healthy preoccupations. If therefore someone takes the part to entertain healthy thoughts and agreeable to God, he will be exempt from sin and from weaknesses. It is known already by elsewhere that sin, which results from a defect and an alteration of health, is a thing without consistency nor hypostasis. From then, as long as he enjoyed health, that is to say that he observed the divine precept, Adam also bore in him no trace of sin; but when, by a voluntary impulse, he had turned his spirit towards the attractions of voluptuousness and had become the slave of abominable concupiscence, from the fact that he had strayed from the right path, one says and understands that he has been subjected to sin.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now that depended on his full will, to sin, I say, and to not sin. And it is thus that he has been stripped also of the grace of immortality, by troubling by the shadow of sin the image of the divine resemblance, in virtue of which, formed (as an intelligent being) with regard to his soul, he had been filled by the society of the Holy Spirit and rendered capable of all science and all virtue, — that is there, in effect, what signifies the breath of life which, as the divine Word has said, had been breathed into his face<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> by his Creator; — for he had previously received the threat: "The day that you eat of it, you shall surely die."<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> Now it is the true death which is envisaged here: the separation from life and the estrangement from God who is life by nature and immortality, and it is concerning this that it has also been written by one of the divine sages: God is not the author of death<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>. By elsewhere, (God) had probably formulated the threat of what was to result from sin, so that man, remaining firm in the observation of the divine precept and taking pleasure in the favor and the enjoyment of the divine society, rendered death inoperative and did not separate himself from God. But when he had sinned against him, (God), in his mercy and his compassion for what he had formed, did not inflict on him a cruel but a very sweet condemnation. For, since it is proper to composites to dissolve, in decreeing on him: "You are dust, and to dust you shall return"<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>, he dissolves him who had been constituted by composition, while reserving for him regeneration and resurrection by his divine inhumanation. Not to dissolve him who had been reached by sin, what would that have been other than to let the evil which issued from it remain immortal? Moreover, before the transgression, it is the entire man that (God) threatens with death, for the case where he would infringe the precept: he declares without making discrimination: "The day that you eat of it, you shall surely die"<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>, to restrain, by fear, every voluntary impulse towards sin. But after he had infringed (the precept) and sinned, (God) condescended to pity and granted pardon to the reasonable soul, which had deviated towards the voluptuousness of the earthly body by reason of its conjunction with it; for "He knows of what we are formed and he remembered that we are dust"<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>, following the word of the prophet the Psalmist. He split the dark judicial sentence, reduced it by half, so to speak, the decree and reserved for the body alone the condition of being mortal, in saying: "You are dust, and to dust you shall return"<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>, to avoid that the reasonable soul, anew condemned by the divine word, would stray completely from God, that it could absolutely no longer redress itself nor look towards the summits from where it had fallen.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">But it is necessary that we affix to that which has been said the seal of the words of the holy Fathers and of the doctors. For, when we shall have cited testimonies concerning each of (our) assertions, the exposition will be at the same time entirely worthy of faith, clear and clothed, moreover, with the words of the testimonies as with a sort of adornment and an invincible cuirass, since it will abstain from making certain declarations and from bringing, by elsewhere, to the debate enunciations of the doctrine of the Fathers which have a different signification.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore Athanasius has bequeathed to us the foundation of the infallible faith concerning the inhumanation, (to know) that it is necessary to confess a unique nature of the God Word who took body. Gregory the Theologian has called his doctrines the norm of orthodoxy; Saint Cyril also has declared that he had, by his apostolic and irresistible thought, attacked the innovations of the futile discourses of perverse heretics, that he had, by his expositions, as by the sweet odor of a prepared ointment, filled with joy, ease and gaiety all that is under the heaven, and that all had attested the orthodoxy and the precision of his doctrine. It is he who in a treatise entitled 'Catechesis on the corporeal apparition of the Son of God, our Lord and Savior Jesus-Christ, become man for us, has written that which follows: [ATHANASIUS] "For God is good, indeed better, he is the source of all goodness. Now in him who is good, one finds no jealousy for anything whatsoever. From then, because he does not experience the jealousy which would make him refuse existence to anything whatsoever, by the intermediary of his Word, who is our Lord Jesus-Christ, he has made all from nothing, and he has taken more pity on the human race than on all that is on the earth. And as he saw it inept, by the nature of its origin, to remain always, granting them an additional favor, he has not simply created men like all the other living beings which populate the earth, but he has made them in his image, by giving them still afterwards the grace which derives from his Word; holding thus, so to speak, shadows of his image and become reasonable, they could remain in beatitude, by living truly in paradise the life which is in reality that of the saints. Because he knows, by elsewhere, that the way of men can lean in the two directions, in advance he has fortified, by a law and (the choice) of a place, the grace which had been accorded to them. For, after having introduced them into his paradise, he gave them this law: if they kept the grace and remained good, they would have, in paradise, a life which ignores sadness, affliction, death and anxiety; if on the contrary they deviated, if they changed and became evil, they would know that they were going themselves to undergo, by death, the natural corruption, that henceforth they would no longer live in paradise, but that, dying henceforth outside of paradise they would remain in death and in corruption."<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Behold that he calls very clearly death, which separates the soul from the body, a corruption according to nature. It is that dissolution is inherent by nature to composites. Now dissolution, that is death and the separation of the soul from the body and from all of which the body is constituted; for the human body has not been formed only from earth, but also from elements which are connected to it: God, (who is) its author and former, indicated it clearly, when he lowered his regard upon Job and, as to interrogate him, said to him: "Have you, you also, taken slime from the earth and formed a man, and have you placed him on the earth endowed with language?"<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>. For the slime is without contest dust mixed with water; it presents also, in part, an alloy of air and light of which bodies are constituted. As for the living being endowed with language, who has been placed on earth by him who formed him and who evolves there, what does he signify, if not the reasonable man, composed of an intelligent soul and a body, who would not have undergone the dissolution of death and the natural corruption, if he had possessed the grace of immortality and had not first undergone the corruption of the soul which is outside of nature, if he had not deviated in abominable voluptuousness and had not transgressed the precept? For the doctor reveals two things: and that immortality, as well as the society and the divine illumination, was a grace, since he says that (God) has fortified, by a law and (the choice) of a place, the grace which had been accorded to them, and that the deviation was malice; he has said in effect: "if they deviated, if they changed and became evil". Now malice is a passion of the soul towards which the spirit has inopportunely turned: from the fact that he said: "if they deviated", he designates perfectly and adequately a masterful impulse of itself and (indicates) that it was possible for them to not change.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Saint Cyril also establishes this point, — that it is not from nature, but from grace that man has been despoiled by his defection, — in his instruction Of the solutions, which he composed to the address of the deacon Tiberius and his confreres. He says there perfectly and as if he were noting a rule: [CYRIL] "For we have lost nothing of what we possess by nature"<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup> And again, in the first book of the Commentary on the Gospel of John, he writes that which follows: [CYRIL] "Man is therefore a reasonable animal, but composed, understand of a soul and of this earthly and temporal flesh. Because he had been made by God and had come into becoming, without holding by his own nature incorruptibility nor indestructibility, — those indeed belong by nature to God alone, — he had been marked with the spirit of life, acquiring, by an intimate relation with God, a good which surpasses nature; for 'He breathed into his face a breath of life and man became a living soul'<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>. Receiving the chastisement of his defection, he then heard justly: 'You are dust, and to dust you shall return'<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>. He has been stripped of the grace and the breath of life has left the earthly flesh, understand the Spirit of him who has said: 'I am the life'<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>. And the living being fell into death, according to the flesh alone, while the soul maintained itself in immortality, for it is of the flesh alone that it had been said: 'You are dust, and to dust you shall return'<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">This is what the wise Athanasius has said very clearly in these terms, in the work cited above, where he added still that which follows and where he indicated which is the corruption of sin which is outside of nature, and which is, on the contrary, the natural corruption of death which ceaselessly reaches man: [ATHANASIUS] "Man is mortal according to his nature, from the fact that he has become from things which are not; but thanks to his resemblance with him who is, supposing that he had conserved it by the contemplation of God, he would have repressed the natural corruption and would have remained incorruptible; as the Wisdom says: 'The observation of the law is the guarantee of incorruptibility'<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>. Now as long as he was incorruptible, he already lived as if he had been deified, as the divine Scripture shows still somewhere which declares: 'I have said: You are gods, you are all sons of the Most High; but you shall die like men and you shall fall like one of the princes'<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>. And that was accomplished by the consent (given) to the serpent: [ATHANASIUS] "As the Wisdom says again: 'God created man for incorruptibility' and made him an image of his eternity; it is by the envy of the demon that death entered into the world<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>. And when that was done, men were reached by death; by elsewhere, corruption triumphed over them, in affirming all the more, more than (exiged the natural order), its hold on the entire human race, that it had previously received the threat of God which weighed on the (men) in case of transgression of the precept"<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">This apostolic doctor declares therefore clearly and teaches that the death of man and the dissolution of the composite is a natural corruption, that he has undergone in losing the grace of incorruptibility and of immortality: he has not conserved it in remaining faithful to the law and to the precept which had been given to him, but, yielding by the ruse of the serpent to the attraction of concupiscence and orienting in this sense the free disposition that he had of himself, he has been, as the Apostle has said, corrupted in his thoughts<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup>; reached by this infirmity, by a corruption which is outside of nature, he (set himself) to "think outside of what it is necessary to think"<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>; rather than the enjoyment of God, he chose for himself that which appeared to him desirable and strayed from duty. How from then would we take the word "corruption" in a single and same sense and attribute it uniquely to the corruption which is outside of nature, to sin, I say? And will we not say that the death of man also, I mean the dissolution of the composite, is a natural corruption? Reducing on the contrary the term to an inadequate acceptation, will we say: What then! Is God the author of corruption? To speak in this manner is assuredly the fact of an insensate. For it is from an inexact (usage) of this term that it results that God is cause also of the corruption which is outside of nature, that is to say of sin.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Every creature, in effect, is submitted to change and to alteration, for immutability belongs only to the sole uncreated God and to the substantial life, because he is he who is; on the contrary the armies of the angels on high and all those who are below God, as are also the reasonable creatures, are changing natures and susceptible of alteration. This is what the demon and those who have transgressed with him attest: belonging previously to the armies of the good angels, they have, of their full will, turned away their regards from the vision of God, became inflated with pride<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup> and were reached by the infirmity of change; and of the corruption which is outside of (their) nature. This is (what attests) also the prophet Ezekiel who represents the God of the universe addressing allegorically the prince of Tyre, and in reality the demon, to show him what he had become and how he had been banished in changing (dispositions); he spoke to him thus: "You have sinned and you have been banished from the mountain of God and a cherub has made you go out from the midst of the stones of fire; your heart has been elevated because of your beauty, and your wisdom has been corrupted with your beauty; it is because of the multitude of your sins that I have precipitated you on the earth"<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup>. He has therefore given the name of "stones of fire" to the armies of the angels, since another prophet also has called thus the holy men who had conducted themselves like angels, when he said: "Holy stones rolled on the earth"<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup>. By elsewhere, he has given the name of "holy mountain" to the elevated rank of the armies from on high, of which the cherubim, who (there) fulfill so to speak the office of lancers, have chased the demon who had corrupted his wisdom and, by pride, had forgotten his rank. For among the angels also there is a wisdom which prevents from losing sight of the disposition of the ranks; it is for this that the divine book of the Canticle of Canticles calls "ranged" these spiritual and immaterial armies, in designating them under the name of "ranged army"<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup>. Will we say therefore, here again, that God is the author of the change and of the corruption which are outside of the nature of the (pure) intelligences? Not at all, but well that he is the creator of creatures and of changing natures, since immutability by nature is the proper of the uncreated nature; that he has, by elsewhere, gratified them with a sufficient light, since it concerns reasonable beings, with an enjoyment which (makes them) take pleasure in the vision of God and of his glory, and by that (enables them) to establish and affirm themselves in immutability, and not only that, but to say also with the Apostle: "The charity of Christ constrains us."<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup> It is therefore for having turned away by their own free will their gazes from that enjoyment of beatitude and glorification (of God), that the demon, as well as his armies, accomplices of his rebellion, became for themselves the cause of the change and the corruption of their intelligences and that they entered into darkness. For darkness is indeed the separation from the true light and true death is the abandonment of true life.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore, as we say for these reasons that God is the creator of changing creatures, and not of change and corruption, so also we rightly confess, when it comes to the formation of man, — since he is a composite and mortal nature, — that God is its creator, but not of death, of dissolution and of natural corruption. For he would have had the power to preserve the grace of (reflecting) the divine image and of immortality, if his spirit had not first changed and if he had not been reached by the corruption occurring outside of nature, which had made him return to dust, as Ecclesiastes said<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup>, to dissolution and natural death; for it is proper to the composite nature to dissolve once it is stripped of the guardianship of God. This is what He Himself declared in decreeing: "You are dust and you shall return to dust"<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup>. For He did not say: "Now you have become dust", but "You are", meaning: what you are by nature, you shall become and you shall dissolve; for dissolution is linked to the earth and you would not have undergone it if you had kept the garment of incorruptibility which would have guaranteed you indissolubility. For we have heard the word of the great doctor Athanasius who teaches: [ATHANASIUS] "Man is mortal according to his nature, from the fact that he became from things that are not; but thanks to (his) resemblance with him who is, supposing that he had preserved it by the contemplation of God, he would have repressed the natural corruption and would have remained incorruptible; as Wisdom says: 'Fidelity to the Law is the guarantee of incorruptibility'<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That the angelic spirits, (purely) intellectual and immaterial, are subject to change, is again a doctrinal word that affirms it for us. For behold what Basil, the divine sage, teaches in a Letter addressed to Amphilochius on the Holy Spirit, where he shows that these beings also need the help of the divine Spirit: [BASIL] "They preserve their dignity by their perseverance in the good: while their will enjoys free will, they never fail in their Constancy in the true good; in this measure (however) that if one comes, in thought, to withdraw (from them) the Spirit, the choirs of angels disintegrate, the principalities of archangels are destroyed and all falls into confusion; their life becomes lawless, without order and without determination. For how could the angels say: Glory to God in the highest<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> without being comforted by the Spirit? For no one can say: Jesus is Lord, if it is not in the Holy Spirit and no one, if he speaks in the Spirit of God, says: Jesus is anathema<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup>. This is what the evil spirits say, their antagonists, whose fall confirms the fact that the (purely) intellectual armies enjoy free disposal of themselves and that they have an equal inclination to virtue and vice. That is why they need the help of the Spirit"<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is the same thing that Saint Cyril also says, expressing himself here again in concise terms, as to enunciate a rule, in his work addressed To the faithful emperor Theodosius: [CYRIL] "For what in some manner has taken a beginning to be, has from that moment also the change innate in itself. But God, who surpasses all intelligence, who possesses eternity, who transcends and escapes becoming and corruption, is above change"<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup>. Similarly, in the sixth book of the Commentary on the Gospel of John, he said: [CYRIL] "For everything that has been made is corruptible, even if it is not yet corrupted, because, by the will of God, it is maintained in incorruptibility. But God is incorruptible and eternal according to his nature, without having acquired it by the will of another, as creatures do, but because he always exists in his own goods, among which is also eternity"<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup>. With this agrees also what the Apostle said who writes to Timothy concerning the God who is above all: "King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone possesses immortality"<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup>: creatures maintaining themselves in immortality and incorruptibility only by his will and the grace that emanates from him and needing to receive from him help, even if they possess an immortal nature like the angels, while that truly belongs properly to him alone, since he is the life of their souls, the support of all beings and the dispenser of all goods. This is what the very wise Cyril confirms again in the forty-fifth homily On the Gospel of Luke, saying: [CYRIL] "It is to the supreme nature alone that belongs the faculty of vivifying the dead; it alone possesses immortality, and it is from it that draws the return to movement and to life, everything that has been called by it to that state"<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is therefore demonstrated that, just as God is the creator of changing creatures and natures, and not of change, so also he is the creator of the mortal and corruptible nature, and not of dissolution, death and corruption, since he had conferred from the beginning what was lacking to nature by the grace of immortality, of society and of divine illumination which had to be kept with precaution. Now Adam had not preserved this grace, because, by his will, his spirit had been weakened by the concupiscence of the forbidden fruit; by the change, the beginning of corruption and the action of sin, he had become for himself, since he was composite and mortal, the cause of his return to dissolution and to natural corruption.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is for this that the Word of God, author of our composite, by whom God made everything, wanting by pure goodness to raise up what had fallen, to elevate it to its primitive rank and to restore to it the grace of immortality, did not act by constraint by resorting to his divine power, but he decreed, conforming to the exigencies of justice, that he himself who had fallen would fight again to (repair) his defeat. And as it belonged to no man to prevail in this struggle, nor to the power of another creature to abrogate the judicial sentence of God who had said: "You are dust and you shall return to dust"<sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup>, and that on the other hand man had to triumph over Satan who had first seduced and vanquished him and first reserved death for him, to this situation without issue, God himself, the Word, the Wisdom and the Power of God the Father, gave an issue. Himself, without (undergoing) change, became man, while remaining also in that by which he is God, and he made the machinations of the perverse demon fall back upon his own head: he made him discover that this same man, whom he had seduced by telling him that he would become God if he ate of the forbidden fruit, was truly both God and man. From then, since, as I have said, the illegitimacy was the following, to undertake anew the combat to (repair) the defeat, he hypostatically united, with the exception of sin, as we have said, the entire human composite, which was by nature corruptible and mortal, which had been vanquished and had lost the grace of immortality; in this way, coming to grips with the devil in what is mortal and passible, coming to blows as in a struggle, he had to, thanks to the voluntary death of the redemption, win the victory conformably to the Law and the exigencies of justice. For, if he tasted death in what is naturally apt to suffer, that is to say in the flesh, he also demonstrated that the enemy was dead by the resurrection: by it he resurrected the whole human race, making himself known to us as the first-born from the dead<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup>. All this, indeed, he accomplished and effected for us who believe in him, who are baptized in the image of his death and who imitate, in the measure possible, the three days of his burial by our triple immersion in the mysterious waters<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup>, where we draw strength and the pledge of a resurrection, even if we undergo common death and the corruption of nature. For it is a regeneration that is the baptism conferred in the death of our Lord, who came to experience death in the flesh, and who tasted it only in it alone, as it is written<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup>, and who, by his resurrection, destroyed the power of death. Also, writing to the Hebrews, the very wise Paul taught that the Word of God had shared the same nature as us, insofar as it was subjected to the power of death, so that, in it, coming to grips with death, he might destroy the power of the latter as well as Satan who, through it, had prevailed over us. He says indeed: "Since therefore the children have shared in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage"<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup>. Behold that the teacher of the nations, the accredited steward of the mysteries of God<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup> proclaims the reason for which the God Word shared these traits like us, meaning blood and flesh: it is that he wanted, thanks to these elements subjected to the empire of death, to struggle with death and, as I have said, to undertake anew the combat to (repair) our defeat.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now, that it is well so, the eminent doctors of the churches also have taught it through the ages; and John, who was bishop of the church of Constantinople and who had abundantly poured out the spiritual drink, attests it clearly, writing what follows in the Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans: [CHRYSOSTOM] "Now what is great is the modality of the victory. For it is not another flesh that he took, but that very one which had been humiliated, like the man who, at the sight of a city woman who is publicly beaten, would say that he is himself her son, whereas he is the son of a king, and in this way would snatch her from those who drag her away by force. This is what he himself did: he made profession of being the 'Son of Man', he made himself the auxiliary (of the flesh) and he condemned sin, the latter therefore no longer dared to strike her afterwards. He struck her nevertheless with the blow of death, and from that very blow arose the condemnation and the perdition, not for the flesh which had been struck, but for the sin which had struck (it). And that was the most admirable thing of all! For if the victory had not occurred in the flesh, the thing would not be so admirable, since the Law also produced a similar effect; but what is admirable is that the victory was established with the concourse of the flesh, that she who had many times been humiliated by sin, herself won a splendid victory over him. See indeed how many wonders occurred: one, that sin did not vanquish the flesh; another, that it was vanquished and that it was vanquished by the very flesh, — for not being vanquished and going so far as to win the victory are not equivalent things for what had always been humiliated; — a third, that she not only vanquished it but also chastised it; indeed, if it is by not sinning that she did not know defeat, it is also by dying that she vanquished and condemned it, making appear to it as an object of fear this flesh that it despised before; and it is thus that she destroyed also its power and that she killed death which had been introduced through the intermediary (of sin). For, as long as he made sinners his prey, it is conformably to the exigencies of justice that he made death weigh upon them; but as he delivered to death a body that he had found without sin, he was condemned for having infringed justice. You see how many victories were won: the flesh is not vanquished by sin, the flesh even vanquishes it and condemns it; she does not confine herself to condemning it, but she condemns it because it has sinned. For she begins by reproaching it for having infringed justice and condemns it on that account, not simply by virtue of (her) power and (her) authority, but following the exigencies of justice. For this is what he made understood in saying: 'For sin, he condemned sin in his flesh'<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup>, as one would say: he reproached it for having gravely failed justice and then he condemned it. You have seen that it is sin that everywhere was condemned and not the flesh, but that she even triumphed over it and that she pronounced against it a judicial sentence. Now if he says that he 'sent his son in the likeness of sinful flesh'<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup>, do not believe for that reason that (his) flesh is other; indeed, it is because he said: '(a flesh) of sin' that he added 'likeness'. For Christ did not have a sinful flesh, but one which while being similar to our sinful (flesh), was without sin and which was also, by nature, the same as ours; so that it also follows from this that the nature of the flesh is not evil. For it is not after having taken another (flesh) instead of the first or after having transformed this one in its nature, that Christ prepared it to resume the combat in this state; but leaving it to persist in its nature, he made it gird a crown (of triumph) over sin, and then, after the victory, he resurrected it and made it immortal"<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Your Piety will undoubtedly have deduced from what the doctors have said that he who had arranged redemption for us came to grips with death in a mortal flesh, that he renewed the combat and won the victory to (repair) our defeat, making immortal, by his resurrection, the flesh which was subject to death. For the doctor clearly said of the flesh of Our Lord: "And then, after the victory, he resurrected it and made it immortal"<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup>, after having also said previously, and just as clearly, this other thing: "For Christ did not have a sinful flesh, but one which, while being similar to our sinful flesh, was without sin and also, the same, our (nature)"<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore, it is already known that, for the corruption resulting from sin, one finds not the slightest trace in the flesh of our Lord, for it was holy and without sin from the moment of generation. The holy Scriptures also proclaim it clearly by the prophecy of Isaiah: "Before the child knows good or evil, he will reject the evil"<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup>, and further on: "He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth"<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup>. That he was subject to the corruption which flows from death, to the other sufferings and to the irreproachable passions, which do not fall under the guilt of sin, because he is by his nature mortal and subject to death, and that all these traits were indeed found in him, this is what we profess. For it is not by an effect of (his) power and (his) authority, as the Doctor said<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup>, but following the exigencies of justice that the Emmanuel willed to renew the combat to (repair) our fall. Now it was impossible that this be realized according to justice, if he had not struggled with death in a flesh that was subject to it and if he had not thus shown it without efficacy by the resurrection, making incorruptible and immortal the flesh in which he had accepted to pass through the experience of death. For, although, following the prophecy of Isaiah, at the time of the voluntary sufferings, he was without appearance and without glory and had neither grace nor beauty, but his aspect was contemptible and disfigured in comparison with that of all men and that he was a man maltreated, he knew nevertheless how to bear (our) diseases<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup>; he himself bore our sins on the wood<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup>, accepting to charge himself with our crimes, and he alone sufficed to bear the infirmities of us all. For he was truly God, even when, without (undergoing) alteration, he became incarnate and became similar to us. And that is why the prophet said again: "Because of the sins of my people he came to death"; and without confining himself to that, he added also this: "His life was cut off from the earth"<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup>: it is indeed the life of him who by his will descended into death that was cut off from the earth. And he was evaluated, he walked and he passed above the heavens, because he was the King of glory, the substantial Life according to his nature and the Lord of hosts. He also occupies a throne in the heights<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup>, so that even the heavenly armies recognized and confessed him, although, by reason of the economy (realized) for us and the voluntary stripping, he had submitted to the opprobrium coming from the passions and to the ineffaceable character of what is on earth, that the flesh hypostatically and inseparably united to him had normally given him. The passion and the opprobrium had occurred in it and, while striving to attack the incarnate God, they were incapable of reaching the Impassible, because there is also impossibility there<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The holy bishop John confirms these words again in the eightieth book of the Commentary on the Gospel of John, writing as follows: [CHRYSOSTOM] "Glorify me, Father, with yourself with the glory that I had with you before the world existed"<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup>. And where did this glory reside? If it happens that you were among men, normally devoid of glory because of the garment that covered you, how did you seek to be glorified also with God? What does he say here then? It is of the economy that it is a question, since the nature of the flesh had not yet been glorified, that it did not enjoy incorruptibility either and that it did not share the throne of royalty. That is why he did not say 'on the earth', but 'with you'. It is of this same glory that we also will enjoy in our measure, if we have watched. That is why Paul also said<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup>: 'If we suffer with him, we will also be glorified with him'"<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup>. What can be more luminous than these words which clearly make understood that the doctor says here again of the flesh, of which he had said above<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup> that the Emmanuel had resurrected it and made it immortal after having come to grips with death, that it enjoyed the incorruptibility that it did not have before his passion. For the Sage willed, — not because he would have been incapable of making his flesh incorruptible, impassible and immortal, from the very moment of (his) union with it, that is to say from the instant he became incarnate, — that it was by virtue of the exigencies of justice, and not by the effect of the abundance of his divine power, that he renewed the combat to (repair) our defeat, that it was in a passible, corruptible and mortal flesh that he struggled with death and that he extirpated it thus by the resurrection; so that we also, following as (our) first-fruits the first-born from the dead<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup>, were to, after the experience of death, enjoy, from the resurrection of the dead, immortality and glory in the kingdom of the heavens. For the Doctor said: "It is of this same glory that we also will enjoy in our measure, if we have watched"<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup>. Indeed, the Word of God, who lacked nothing, did not want anything whatsoever to be added to him, by the inhumanation, to increase his glory, — for we have seen his glory, says the evangelist, the glory that an only Son receives from his Father, full of grace and truth<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup>, — but he humbled himself in becoming man without (undergoing) change, he behaved with us according to our measures, he was proposed as the way (to follow) in everything in our vicissitudes that he (himself) traversed, and he really died in a flesh subject to death; thus, by the resurrection of the dead, he inaugurated for us immortality, incorruptibility and impassibility, so that we also might walk in his footsteps. How therefore would it be an opprobrium for him who, while being rich as God, is poor from the fact that he became incarnate, to undertake, in a corruptible, passible and mortal flesh, a struggle that was imposed on us, to win over death, borrowing traits that are ours, a victory conformed to justice and not due to violence, and to trace for us all, the believers, to whose nature he participated in becoming incarnate, a road that leads to resurrection, to immortality and to incorruptibility?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Consider, I pray you, that this same Doctor, in the Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, says this: [CHRYSOSTOM] "Do not therefore permit the body to live now, so that it may live then; make it die so that it may not die. For if it remains alive, it will not live, but if it dies, it is then that it will live. This will also occur at the general resurrection: it is necessary first that it die and that it be buried and that then it become immortal. This is what also happened at baptism: it was therefore first crucified and it was buried, and then it is resurrected. This is what also happened to the body of the Lord: he also was crucified and he died, and then he resurrected. Let us behave in the same way, we also: let us mortify it always in (its) actions, I do not say the nature, not at all, but the impulse that carries to evil actions, since that also is life, or rather, that is life: to tolerate nothing that is human and not to become the slaves of (our) desires"<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup>. In all things therefore Christ became for us a guide, as he said himself in the gospel<sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup>, because he took upon himself the likeness with us, with the exception of sin<sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup>. For it is by nature that he was one of us, and not by sin, which is moreover not an entity but an infirmity of the will. What our nature is, its definition shows: it includes globally every rational and mortal animal capable of intelligence and science. It is thus also that the wise Cyril wrote To the impious Diodore<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "Behold, our friend, the definition of human nature, which is also called essence: a rational and mortal animal"<sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup>. And similarly, in the sixth book of the Commentary on the Gospel of John [CYRIL] "The notion of man, that is to say the definition of his essence: a rational and mortal animal, capable of intelligence and science"<sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">From then, the author of our nature, who made it both mortal and rational, hypostatically united to himself this same nature that he had made, while being one from two perfect (Elements), divinity and humanity, and, the same, God and man, and a unique hypostasis, and a unique incarnate nature of the Word himself, to restore to us what was lacking to us, I mean the grace of immortality, by the resurrection, which is the return to (our) primitive state. For what he said, when he was preparing to go to the voluntary crucifixion and to assume, by death, the combat against Satan, who held power over death: "For the prince of this world is coming, and he has nothing in me"<sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup>, does not equate to: "it is impossible for me to have a passible and mortal body", but: "(it is impossible) to see in me the slightest sin nor a trace of any culpability or fault". It is the demon who, first, invented sin, and it is he only who holds it in his possession, so to speak, (this sin) which is neither a substance, nor a hypostasis, (but) an infirmity affecting the will of those who love sin, who are inclined to the unbridled desires (to commit) misdeeds that are accomplished in the world; and it is for this very reason that he is also called "Prince of the world" because he became the principle and the guide of the evil that has spread in the world. This is what the evangelist John also said in his letter: "Do not love the world, nor the things of the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vain glory of the world, does not come from God, but from the world."<sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup> And that is why our Lord also said to the disciples in the gospel: "You are not of this world"<sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup>, meaning: of the voluptuousness of the passions and the license, of which the demon is the principle. For the author and the king of human nature, as also of any other creature, is the Word of God, Christ, with the Father and with the Holy Spirit. Indeed, even if it stripped itself of the grace of immortality as a result of Adam's defection, is it not, even in this state, an object formed by the one who created it? And the fact of being incarnated in a mortal flesh, endowed with an intelligent soul, to win a just victory over Satan, who holds power over death, did not affect him with opprobrium.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For if Christ had been the cause for which the human composite lost the grace of immortality, like the first Adam who committed sin, the mortal condition of the flesh would have brought accusation against him; but if he found it mortal, sick and weak, if he took it as a physician, hypostatically united himself to it and if it is in it that he fought against him who held the power of death, while there was in him no trace of sin — for he committed none, he who knows no injustice — it is with very good reason that he said before the redemptive crucifixion: "The Prince of the world comes and he has nothing in me."<sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">This is again attested by the glorious doctrinal word of Cyril in the tenth book of the Commentary on the Gospel of John, who writes this: [CYRIL] "But the prince of this world comes and he possesses nothing in me<sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup>, meaning: I will not be convicted of having committed injustice, but there will be, against me, for the Jews, no legitimate motive of repudiation and Satan possesses in me nothing of what is proper to him; for to him indeed belong the evils, and the blossoming of sin finds in him its principle"<sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup>. Now sin is the death of the soul: it is what provokes in it the separation and the privation from God, who is the true life; as for the death of the body in any case, one cannot conceive it otherwise than by its separation from the soul and from the present sensible life. The same thing is expressed in these terms by Saint Gregory, bishop of Nyssa, in the Catechetical Discourse: [GREGORY OF NYSSA] "For just as we call death the separation of the flesh from the sensible life, so also, concerning the soul, we give the name of death to the separation from the true life"<sup><a href="#fn92" id="ref92">92</a></sup>. It is in this same sense also that it is said that Satan is dead and that he has been reduced to impotence, and together with him the armies that had transgressed with him, because he has been deprived of God, who is the true life. Thus, in his fall, he heard God say to him, as Isaiah says: "As for you, you will be banished on the mountain as a corpse that causes horror, with many corpses struck by the sword who descend to Sheol"<sup><a href="#fn93" id="ref93">93</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Who therefore is so unreasonable and opposes the divine Scriptures to the point of calling the death of our God and our Savior Jesus-Christ — which is nothing other than the separation of the soul from the body — the separation from God, which results from (the presence of) sin in the soul, while he himself committed no sin and no deceit was found in his mouth?<sup><a href="#fn94" id="ref94">94</a></sup> Also let no one reject, by attachment to vain pretexts, the true and redemptive death that he underwent in the flesh and which had to occur in a body susceptible to suffering, to dying and to corruption. It is therefore with good reason that the second Adam, the head of the body of the Church, the first-born from the dead<sup><a href="#fn95" id="ref95">95</a></sup>, the first, by the resurrection, rendered incorruptible and impassible and immortal his flesh, which was previously corruptible and passible and mortal, becoming for us the way and the principle of our resurrection, of our incorruptibility, of our impassibility and of our immortality.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The word of Saint John, bishop of Constantinople, in the Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, confirms these ideas again, when he elucidates what our Lord said to his disciples: "From now on I will not drink of this fruit of the vine, until the day when I will drink it in a new way with you"<sup><a href="#fn96" id="ref96">96</a></sup> and says the following: "For you who are my witnesses, you will see me resurrected. And what does this word 'new' mean? In a new way, that is to say, which is not customary, from the fact that I do not have a passible body, but henceforth immortal and incorruptible and not experiencing the need for nourishment. It is therefore not by need that he ate and drank after the resurrection — the body no longer experienced the need for it — but to confirm by this the fact of the resurrection"<sup><a href="#fn97" id="ref97">97</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The doctrinal word therefore proclaiming more loudly and with more brilliance than the trumpet that incorruptibility and impassibility and immortality are but one and the same thing, and again that what is corruptible is mortal and passible, and that the body of Our Lord, after the resurrection, possessed incorruptibility, impassibility and immortality, why has Your Holiness said, considering your contradictor: [JULIAN] "How not to believe that incorruptibility affected at all times the passible body of Our Lord, even when he suffered voluntarily for others?"<sup><a href="#fn98" id="ref98">98</a></sup>. And again: [JULIAN] "How will you also understand this word of Saint Cyril: 'Henceforth incorruptible'<sup><a href="#fn99" id="ref99">99</a></sup>? Not that he was previously corruptible, but that he was only considered as being corruptible, and that he was manifested only after the resurrection as being incorruptible"<sup><a href="#fn100" id="ref100">100</a></sup>. And again: [JULIAN] "What is corruptible by (its) common nature, and not in another manner — for it was indeed assumed from what is corruptible — has been manifested as being incorruptible by the union to the Word, in contracting no corruption neither in the conception nor in the death, as if it escaped the common character of our nature, as Gregory of Nysse also says in the catechetical discourse<sup><a href="#fn101" id="ref101">101</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn102" id="ref102">102</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Well then, let us examine: how these ideas agree with the words of the orthodox doctors who, with the help of the Holy Spirit, have elucidated the thought of the holy Scriptures. The venerable John, in the texts cited above, writes in his own terms that the flesh of our Lord did not enjoy incorruptibility before the resurrection and says: [CHRYSOSTOM] "Since the nature of the flesh had not yet been glorified, that it did not enjoy incorruptibility either and that it did not enjoy the throne of royalty"<sup><a href="#fn103" id="ref103">103</a></sup>. And you, who love God, you said that incorruptibility had always affected the passible body of our Lord, even when he suffered voluntarily for others. From then, if he was incorruptible, impassible and immortal, how do you call him, the same, passible? For, incorruptible and impassible, he ceased to be naturally apt to suffer! From then the death of our Lord is an imaginary thing and not a truth. For how could death have seized him who is immortal, incorruptible and impassible? He who possessed the empire of death, according to the word of Paul<sup><a href="#fn104" id="ref104">104</a></sup>, would not have been destroyed, if he had not been vanquished by what he possessed. For it is for this indeed that the Apostle said that the Word of God shared with us blood and flesh, to destroy by (his) death him who possessed the empire of death, that is, Satan<sup><a href="#fn105" id="ref105">105</a></sup>. If, by the very fact that the Word made man had shared the flesh, his flesh was incorruptible, impassible and immortal, the empire of death was (already) destroyed, the cross of Christ was superfluous and it is in vain that the Apostle had said: "To destroy by (his) death him who possessed the power of death"<sup><a href="#fn106" id="ref106">106</a></sup>. For he was (already) completely destroyed by the fact that the flesh was not subject to death nor to the passions exempt from sin.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But it is not so, no, it is not so, nor either, as you say: [JULIAN] "... not that he was previously corruptible, but that he was considered as being corruptible and that he was manifested only by the resurrection that he was not corruptible"<sup><a href="#fn107" id="ref107">107</a></sup>. For if it is concerning the corruptibility characterized by sin and the shameful passions, that you say that the flesh of Christ was incorruptible, impassible and holy from the very union, it did not demand that this idea be manifested by the resurrection, as you have said. It had indeed in its favor the testimony of its impeccability — "who committed no sin, and in whose mouth no deceit was found"<sup><a href="#fn108" id="ref108">108</a></sup>, that he rejected evil, as it is written<sup><a href="#fn109" id="ref109">109</a></sup>, from the swaddling clothes and that he was in perfect possession of the good — because he was God and also good by nature he who had truly taken it upon himself to become incarnate and to make himself man. That is why he also said to the Jews with an assurance that befits God: "Which of you convicts me of sin?"<sup><a href="#fn110" id="ref110">110</a></sup>. But if you say that in the suffering that he voluntarily experienced, when he was crucified and endured the trial of the flagellation and other (tortures) similar, his flesh was incorruptible and impassible from before the resurrection and that it was called corruptible and passible for the sole reason that it had been taken from our nature and from our corruptible and passible race, while from the very union it had possessed incorruptibility, impassibility and immortality, the voice of the doctors of the mysteries of the truth rises absolutely against this assertion. For we have heard John declare in the texts cited a little above: [CHRYSOSTOM] "For Christ did not have a sinful flesh, but one which, while being similar to our (flesh) sinful, was without sin and by nature the same as ours, so that it also follows from this that the nature of the flesh is not evil. For it is not after having taken another (flesh) instead of the first or after having transformed this one in its nature, that Christ prepared it to resume the combat in this state; but leaving it to persist in its nature, he made it gird a crown (of triumph) over sin, and then, after the victory, he resurrected it and made it immortal"<sup><a href="#fn111" id="ref111">111</a></sup>. By these two things he made clearly understood: both that after the resurrection he made it incorruptible and immortal, and that before the resurrection he left it to persist in its nature so that it might renew the combat for (repairing) our defeat and that it might vanquish death by what is according to its nature mortal, passible and susceptible to suffer and to die. On the other hand this same flesh, of which the same doctor said here that it became immortal by the resurrection, he called it at the same time incorruptible, impassible and immortal. For we have heard him who declared also this: [CHRYSOSTOM] "... from the fact that he does not have a passible body, but henceforth immortal and incorruptible and not experiencing the need for nourishment. It is therefore not by need that he ate and drank after the resurrection — for the body no longer experienced the need for it — but to confirm by this the fact of the resurrection"<sup><a href="#fn112" id="ref112">112</a></sup>. Furthermore he demonstrates again in the Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians that it is not from the incarnation but well following the death and resurrection of Christ that immortality and the destruction of the tyranny of death and its power occurred, when he writes thus: [CHRYSOSTOM] "Have you seen how little by little, as a result of their discourses and their incredulity in the resurrection, the whole economy is destroyed? However until here he has said nothing of the incarnation but of the resurrection! For it is not by becoming incarnate but by dying that he destroyed death, since, when he had a flesh, the tyranny of death held him in its power"<sup><a href="#fn113" id="ref113">113</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">That the Fathers do not say that the holy and sinless body of our God and Savior the Christ is impassible and incorruptible before the resurrection, but passible and, from the fact that it is naturally apt to suffer and to be submitted to the natural passions, provided they are irreprehensible, corruptible, and that it really experienced (infirmities) that were its own, with the permission of the Word and when he willed it; that they do not (say), as your Holiness has declared, (that it was considered as corruptible) because it was assumed from a corruptible nature<sup><a href="#fn114" id="ref114">114</a></sup>, but that in reality it is not corruptible nor either apt to suffer from the moment of the incarnation, this is again what the same doctor John shows, in the sixty-seventh discourse of the Commentary on the Gospel of John, when he comments on the word of Christ: "Now behold my soul is troubled..."<sup><a href="#fn115" id="ref115">115</a></sup> elucidating it: [CHRYSOSTOM] "As if someone said: 'Even if we are troubled and even if we are in fright, let us not flee before death, since I too, who am troubled for the moment, do not speak of fleeing'; for one must bear what presents itself. I do not say: 'Deliver me from the present hour', but what? 'Father, glorify your name'. And although it was this very thing that the trouble pushed me to say, it is the contrary that I say: 'Glorify your name', that is to say: 'Henceforth lead me to the cross'. He puts the accent very well on the humanity and the nature that does not want to die, but that claims to live the life here below, indicating that it was not outside of human passions. For just as neither being hungry nor sleeping are reprehensible, taking pleasure in the life here below is not either. Now Christ had a body exempt from sins, and not detached from the natural necessities, otherwise there would not have been a body either"<sup><a href="#fn116" id="ref116">116</a></sup>. But perhaps, in expressing himself thus, would the Doctor deny that the Emmanuel experienced them voluntarily? Not at all! But on the royal way, without deviating to the right nor to the left, as it is written<sup><a href="#fn117" id="ref117">117</a></sup>, his exposition of the orthodox faith progresses in its middle. For he says in the eighty-fifth discourse of his Commentary this: [CHRYSOSTOM] "After this, knowing that all was consummated<sup><a href="#fn118" id="ref118">118</a></sup>, meaning that nothing was lacking to the economy. For everywhere he strove to show that (his) death was a strange thing, if it is true that all was found in the power of him who died and that death reached (his) body only at the moment when he himself willed it. Now he wanted it to be after having accomplished all. That is why he also said: 'I have power over my soul to lay it down and I have the power to take it up again'<sup><a href="#fn119" id="ref119">119</a></sup>. Knowing therefore that all was consummated, he said: 'I thirst'<sup><a href="#fn120" id="ref120">120</a></sup>. And here again he was accomplishing a prophecy"<sup><a href="#fn121" id="ref121">121</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is this same text that the eminent Cyril, who is the treasure of all the expressions of doctrine, explained in the second book of the Commentary on the Gospel of John. For it is necessary that we draw a chain that is suspended to heaven as to the truth and holds from on high its reasons, that is truly of gold by the tested and solid character of the exposition, and that we make appear that the concordant voice of the doctors is one. Now what Cyril said presents itself in the following way: [CYRIL] "When was consummated all the impiety coming from the iniquity of the Jews against Christ and when nothing more was lacking henceforth for their cruelty which exceeded reason to appear complete, at the end the flesh experienced still something that is proper and natural to it. It let itself be penetrated by thirst, dried up as it was as a result of the different wounds. For violent pains generally provoke an overwhelming thirst, by absorbing, under the effect of an inexpressible physical heat, the humor that is found in the depths (of the body) and by consuming, by inflammatory shooting pains, the interior of the patient. It was not difficult, indeed, for the Word of God who can do all to divert this also from his flesh. But as he had by will tolerated to experience all the rest, he experienced this also by will. That is why he asked to drink"<sup><a href="#fn122" id="ref122">122</a></sup>. You have noticed the rigorous exactitude. For in saying that the suffering was natural to the flesh he did not separate thirst from it; but he added also this: while the Word of God made flesh — a flesh which is such according to its nature — could repulse this suffering, he himself also experienced it voluntarily, like all the others, he who is above all sufferings, and he asked to drink, he who is the life and the support of all; for the flesh, which is naturally apt to be thirsty, was his and it asked to drink.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">In the same book, the wise servant of the Word said this: [CYRIL] "It is therefore in all conformity with the economy that it is then, when he had not yet transformed his temple into the glory that is due to him and that suits him, that our Lord Jesus-Christ appeared thus still in his first forms, because he wanted to make appear the truth of the resurrection not in another form and another body, but in that which he had taken from the Virgin, in which he had died after the crucifixion, as it is written, the power of death rushing upon the flesh alone from which it was also expelled. For if it is not his body which knew death that is resurrected, what death was vanquished? And where would the power of corruption have found itself without force, when none among the reasonable creatures died, neither soul, nor angel, not to speak of the God Word? When therefore the power of death made itself felt only on what is naturally apt to be corrupted, one understands with good right that it is on that also that the power of the resurrection is exercised, so that the force of the tyrant may also be destroyed. As for the fact that Our Lord enters through the closed doors, it is ranked, among the sages, among the other prodigies"<sup><a href="#fn123" id="ref123">123</a></sup>. Will we still contest that Saint Cyril, the other admirable heralds and the doctors of the healthy faith have said that the body of our Lord was made passible and corruptible before the resurrection and not, as your Piety has said, because it had been assumed from our nature and from our passible and corruptible race, but because it was naturally apt to be corrupted, to suffer and to be submitted to the natural passions exempt from sin as well as to death, so that the tyranny and the power of the latter might be destroyed by the resurrection? And it is for this that the doctor said: "If it is not his body which knew death that is resurrected, what death was vanquished? And where would the power of corruption have found itself without force?". From then the victory over death and the weakening of corruption occurred by the resurrection.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is by this resurrection, Peter, the chosen among the apostles, declared, that was realized and accomplished, for Our Lord, not to remain in the power of death, and for his flesh, not to see corruption. For he did not say that it is because he did not die that he did not remain in the power of death, but he said to the crowd of the Jews concerning our Savior the Christ: "This one, as he had been predestined by God, you have delivered into the hands of the impious, you have crucified and put to death"<sup><a href="#fn124" id="ref124">124</a></sup>; and behold he added: "It is he whom God has resurrected, by suppressing the pains of death" — and from now on he introduced the resurrection — "because it was not possible that he be held in his power"<sup><a href="#fn125" id="ref125">125</a></sup>, signifying by "to be held" the eternal detention. It is excellently that he called the resurrection the "suppression of the pains of death", because Christ had raised himself from the bonds of death and from the depths of Sheol as from the entrails that experience the pains of childbirth and that, by the resurrection, he was as if issued from a marvelous childbirth. From there comes therefore also that he was called "First-fruit from the dead"<sup><a href="#fn126" id="ref126">126</a></sup>: the prophet Jonah and the belly of the fish have also happily prefigured him. For it is he who, when he had been devoured and was alive in the belly, said, as emanating from the person of our Savior whom he prefigured, addressing a prayer to God the Father, who had been pleased to snatch us from the bonds of corruption by the death of his Monogenes: "From the entrails of Sheol you have heard the voice of my cry"<sup><a href="#fn127" id="ref127">127</a></sup> and again: "Bring up my life from corruption to you, Lord my God"<sup><a href="#fn128" id="ref128">128</a></sup>; he calls "bosom of Sheol and of corruption" the belly of the fish, which prefigured the true bosom of Sheol and of corruption, where the Emmanuel, when he was there, was not held because of the resurrection. It is for this also that the apostle Peter, taking up the expression again, still makes mention of the resurrection, because of which, he says concerning Christ, he was not abandoned to Sheol and his flesh did not see corruption<sup><a href="#fn129" id="ref129">129</a></sup>. For behold how he speaks of the prophet David: "For he was a prophet and he knew that God had engaged himself towards him by oath to make sit on his throne a fruit of his entrails; it is in foreseeing it that he said of the resurrection of Christ: he was not abandoned to Sheol and his flesh did not see corruption"<sup><a href="#fn130" id="ref130">130</a></sup>.</p>

       <p class="paragraph">This is what Saint Cyril also understood who says, commenting on the prophet Jonah: [CYRIL] "But we find the divine Peter who attributes to him what was said by the voice of David: 'Because you have not abandoned my soul to Sheol and you have not permitted that your holy one see corruption'<sup><a href="#fn131" id="ref131">131</a></sup>. For his flesh did not see corruption: he is indeed resurrected the third day, because it was impossible that, being life by nature, he be held by the bonds of death"<sup><a href="#fn132" id="ref132">132</a></sup>. That his flesh not see corruption but that it be incorruptible and immortal, behold that (Peter) assigned it to the resurrection the third day as well as to the fact that he was not held by the bonds of death, which signifies the complete detention. For no one is opposed to the divine Scriptures to the point of saying of the body of Christ our Savior, that is to say of the incarnate Word, that he was in no way in the power of death and that he did not taste it in a flesh that was subject to death. For we have heard him, in a text cited above, say this: [CYRIL] "... the power of death rushing upon the flesh alone from which it was also expelled. For if it is not his body which knew death that is resurrected, what death was vanquished? And how would the power of corruption have found itself without force, when none among the reasonable creatures died, neither soul, nor angel, not to speak of the Word of God? When therefore the power of death made itself felt only on what is naturally apt to be corrupted..."<sup><a href="#fn133" id="ref133">133</a></sup> one understands with good reason and in truth that it is on this that the power of the resurrection also exercises itself, so that the force of the tyrant may also be destroyed. And again in the Treatise that he composed for the pious emperor Theodosius concerning the complete detention (resulting from) the descent into hell and the burial, and the corruption which (results) from it, he speaks thus: [CYRIL] "For it is not permitted to say that it was ever possible that the flesh united to the Word was the prey of corruption, nor that the divine soul was held captive by the gates of Sheol; for he was not abandoned to hell, as the blessed Peter also said"<sup><a href="#fn134" id="ref134">134</a></sup>. Now if, as your Holiness has said, we understand the word "ever" without discrimination, in the sense that the corruption resulting from the passion has in no way approached the flesh and that it has not tasted the experience of death, nor of hunger, nor of thirst, nor of the pains nor of the wounds of the crucifixion, Saint Cyril intervenes to answer us! Explaining himself, he tells us and cries out to us forcefully, on multiple occasions, the same things: it is in what is naturally apt to be corrupted, in which the power of death made itself felt, it is in that very thing, one understands with good right, that (exercises) the power of the resurrection; and if it is not his body which knew death that is resurrected, what death was vanquished, and where would the power of death have found itself without force!<sup><a href="#fn135" id="ref135">135</a></sup> Thus therefore, on the one hand, the corrupting death took possession of him who was naturally apt to be corrupted, to suffer and to die, and the Emmanuel died for us all in the flesh; on the other hand, she who held him in her power found herself without force by the resurrection, vomiting, like the fish (had done) with Jonah, him whom she had devoured. It is in the same way that Proclus, of equally holy memory, who was bishop of Constantinople, in a Homily delivered in the church of Anthemius(?), where the feast of the salutary passion was celebrated, said in few words: [PROCLUS] "Death vomited him whom she had devoured without knowing him; the sepulcher, the treasury of the resurrection..."<sup><a href="#fn136" id="ref136">136</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">But your Piety, wanting to confirm its exposition, deemed it necessary to take the term in its etymological sense: one would understand in this way that Christ was in no way tempted and that he did not taste the corruption of suffering and of death itself, which (only) occurs in a body naturally apt to be corrupted, as the very wise Cyril said<sup><a href="#fn137" id="ref137">137</a></sup>. You have indeed written this: [JULIAN] "Thus therefore it has been said that he has not seen the corruption. But the profane say that the transition, at the beginning, how was it revealed neither at the beginning nor at the end?"<sup><a href="#fn138" id="ref138">138</a></sup>. To which among the wise profane who have said such a thing do you refer us? I cannot know. For I am personally without competence and still a novice in profane wisdom: indeed, in the past, after having begun to apply myself to it a little, very quickly I despised it in view of the philosophy which (attaches itself) to Christ and by attraction for more simple concerns. But I know, yes, I know clearly that Saint Cyril, who was very versed in profane and sacred wisdom, called without discrimination the corruption and the destruction; there was no difference between them. What the prophet David and the apostle Peter have called "corruption", writing: "And his flesh has not seen the corruption"<sup><a href="#fn139" id="ref139">139</a></sup>, the very wise Cyril has called "destruction", writing: [CYRIL] "it is not permitted to say that it was possible that the flesh united to the Word was the prey of the destruction, nor that the divine soul was held captive by the gates of Sheol; for he was not abandoned to Sheol, as the divine Peter also said"<sup><a href="#fn140" id="ref140">140</a></sup>. But the words of the inspired scriptures also, which David himself pronounced: "You have not permitted that your Holy One see the corruption"<sup><a href="#fn141" id="ref141">141</a></sup>, in the prophet Jonah, the name of "destruction" is given to the belly of the fish, prefiguring that which was in the bosom of Sheol, he cried out: "They will bring up my life from the destruction"<sup><a href="#fn142" id="ref142">142</a></sup>; and again: "In the heart of the earth three days and three nights"<sup><a href="#fn143" id="ref143">143</a></sup> He even went to the sources of the sea and advanced into the depths of the abyss<sup><a href="#fn144" id="ref144">144</a></sup>. He penetrated into the defiles of the mountains and descended upon the earth, whose bolts are the (laws) that govern it eternally. After he had depopulated hell, had made a proclamation to the spirits of that place and had destroyed the invincible gates, he came out again; for his life has come up from the destruction<sup><a href="#fn145" id="ref145">145</a></sup>. All this to attest that corruption and destruction are terms used without discrimination.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And it is even very easily possible for us to demonstrate by the divine words that the word "corruption" does not equate to an entry, a beginning, a transition, as you have said<sup><a href="#fn146" id="ref146">146</a></sup>, but that it refers to the complete and superabundant possession of the authentic corruption, which is the estrangement from God. For the death of man, in dissolving the composite and corrupting by the very fact him who is its prey, does not necessarily imply, in addition, the estrangement from God. Indeed, that "precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his saints"<sup><a href="#fn147" id="ref147">147</a></sup>, and that, on the contrary, "the death of sinners is the worst (that is)"<sup><a href="#fn148" id="ref148">148</a></sup>, the prophet David sings and teaches both things. Who therefore ignores that no one has been corrupted more than the demon, who has been corrupted with an authentic and complete corruption? And behold that God himself, speaking through the intermediary of the prophet Ezekiel, said to him: "Your wisdom with your beauty; it is because of the multitude of your sins that I have cast you down to the earth"<sup><a href="#fn149" id="ref149">149</a></sup>. And David, using the word "destruction" to designate the complete perdition, says: "And you, God, you have made them descend into a pit of destruction"<sup><a href="#fn150" id="ref150">150</a></sup>. And Jeremiah also said similarly: "And I went to the river Euphrates; I dug and I took back the belt from the place where I had hidden it; and behold it was ruined and useless"<sup><a href="#fn151" id="ref151">151</a></sup>. And again: "And I will raise up against them four kinds of plagues, says the Lord: the sword to kill them, the dogs to tear them apart, the beast of the desert and the bird of the sky to devour them and to (bring them to) destruction"<sup><a href="#fn152" id="ref152">152</a></sup>. But it would be superfluous to cite (other) words similar to those; for it is now known, by the texts that we have aligned, that the corruption does not indicate the beginning nor the entry of the corruption, but rather its term and that the lesion penetrates into him who is its victim and seizes him totally, in the manner of arrow points penetrating into a body that is reached by them, or in the manner of a flame of fire running through a forest that it devours in its entirety. (I have added) this, while having said previously that in the treatises the words "corruption" and "destruction" are used without discrimination.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And again in the second book (of the work) called The Treasure, writing things concordant with what has been said above, the eminent Cyril speaks in this way: [CYRIL] "For, since he took a corruptible body, mortal and submitted to similar sufferings, he necessarily appropriated also, with the flesh, the sufferings of the latter; and as the flesh underwent them, he himself is said to have undergone them. It is thus, indeed, that we say that he was crucified and that he died, whereas it is the flesh itself that underwent all that and not the Word taken separately and apart from it"<sup><a href="#fn153" id="ref153">153</a></sup>. And again in the Letter to the monks, of which here is the beginning: "Some have come...", he writes as follows: [CYRIL] "How therefore is it said that he who was alive died? By undergoing death in his own flesh, so that, by vivifying this flesh again, he might appear living"<sup><a href="#fn154" id="ref154">154</a></sup>. And a little later: [CYRIL] "For if he had not suffered for us according to humanity, he would not have accomplished for us either, according to divinity, what pertains to our salvation. It is indeed said that he died first as man and that after this he returned to life, because he is God by nature"<sup><a href="#fn155" id="ref155">155</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Do not the words of doctrine emit a ray more brilliant than the sun, by proclaiming openly that it is in a mortal body, corruptible and subject to the irreprehensible passions that the Word of God, the Christ, was crucified, suffered and died, he who, without change, became incarnate, vivified his flesh by the resurrection and rendered it incorruptible? Now, if it was from the moment of the union that he had been incorruptible, impassible and immortal, how would he have returned to life by the resurrection? For "not to have been the prey of corruption" signifies not to have remained in it and not to see nor undergo dissolution in the sepulchers, like the other dead, who have not at all returned from the sepulchers nor from hell, but have been completely seized by death, which exercises its domination even over those who have not sinned and holds them all in an equal manner: this is what the book of Acts shows clearly. Indeed, it shows us Paul, pronouncing the very words of Peter before the crowd of the Jews, who recalled the same prophetic words and revealed the meaning that we have said, in these terms: "That he has raised him from the dead and that he no longer has to return to corruption, this is what he declares: 'I will grant you the sacred things assured to David'<sup><a href="#fn156" id="ref156">156</a></sup>. That is why he says elsewhere: 'You will not permit that your Holy One see the corruption'<sup><a href="#fn157" id="ref157">157</a></sup>. For David indeed served during his generation, fell asleep by the will of God, he was reunited with his fathers and he saw corruption. But he whom God has raised has not seen the corruption"<sup><a href="#fn158" id="ref158">158</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Here again the very wise Cyril,— we do not have competence to explain what is from him,— shows in clear and expressive terms that the fact, for Christ, of "not seeing the corruption" or of "not being the prey of corruption" signifies that he did not remain at all in the sepulcher; just as the fact that his soul is not abandoned to Sheol indicates that it descended there and that it was under the gates of hell, that, on the other hand, it was not retained there, but that it came up from there and that it thus forced the bolts and bars that could not be broken. For it was necessary that he pass through all that through which we had passed, with the exception of sin, and that through all that he destroy the power of death, not only as strong God, but also as a man, who, himself, was above condemnation and had not even provided death with any motive to be incriminated, except that of being free among the dead, as it is written<sup><a href="#fn159" id="ref159">159</a></sup>. The exposition of the Doctor, drafted in the Letter of Acacius concerning the question of Azazel is the following: [CYRIL] "Let us see therefore in the immolated goat<sup><a href="#fn160" id="ref160">160</a></sup> the Emmanuel reduced to death according to the flesh, but for the destruction of death and of sin. For he was free among the dead<sup><a href="#fn161" id="ref161">161</a></sup>, that is to say that he was not convicted of sin, nor subject with us to a sentence of death. Let us see him also in the other goat, the one who is alive and expelled, he who, while suffering according to humanity, did not suffer according to divinity, and, while being dead according to the flesh, has been above death, who has not, following the estimation of the Jews, remained with us in the tombs and has not been retained with the others by the gates of hell. Indeed, as his disciple said, he has not been abandoned to Sheol and his flesh has not seen either the corruption<sup><a href="#fn162" id="ref162">162</a></sup>; for he returned to life and he reached Sheol, and he said to the prisoners: 'Come out', and to those who were in the darkness: 'Show yourselves!'<sup><a href="#fn163" id="ref163">163</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn164" id="ref164">164</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Saint John, bishop of Constantinople, also, in the sixth discourse of the Commentary on the Epistle to the Colossians, writes this: [CHRYSOSTOM] "There was a sort of single combat. Death struck Christ, but Christ, when he had been reached, ended up killing it himself: it is in a mortal body that she who believed herself to be immortal was destroyed"<sup><a href="#fn165" id="ref165">165</a></sup>. Thus therefore the immortal and indestructible power of death over the human race was not destroyed by the fact that Christ would not have died, but (it was) after the death of Christ, by the resurrection, by the fact that the body was not the prey of total corruption and of the destruction that results from death and from burial, but that, by the resurrection, he made the sepulcher the seat of incorruptibility. And in the fourth discourse of the Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, he writes the following: [CHRYSOSTOM] "He who has been lowered momentarily below the angels, we see that it is Jesus, because of the death with which he was affected. And after that by contrast these privileges 'of being crowned with glory and honor'<sup><a href="#fn166" id="ref166">166</a></sup>! Have you seen the manner in which he applied all that to him? Indeed, this 'momentarily', to whom else does it suit than to him who was in Sheol only three days only, and not to us who undergo corruption for a long time?"<sup><a href="#fn167" id="ref167">167</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus also Athanasius, in the treatise 'On the Faith' directed against the impious Apollinarius, says concerning our Savior to all the Christ: [ATHANASIUS] "He therefore realized the condemnation of sin on the earth, the abrogation of the curse on the wood, the suppression of corruption in the sepulcher and the destruction of death in Sheol. It is to realize the salvation of every man that he passed everywhere showing in his person the resemblance with our image. Otherwise, why were required, for God the birth from a woman, or for the author of the centuries the growth in stature and the count of the years, or again the cross, the tomb or the hell, to which we are subjected, if he had not sought us?"<sup><a href="#fn168" id="ref168">168</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore, enlightened in an equal manner by these doctrines, if we find somewhere the Fathers who declare that the body of Christ our Savior has not been the prey of the corruption of death, we must not think that he did not really die according to the flesh and that he did not taste the condition of a mortal, but that he was not subjected to the corruption of the tomb nor to the complete dissolution, thanks to the divine prodigy of the resurrection. For it is evident by all these (testimonies) that the Word of God rendered, by the resurrection, his holy flesh incorruptible, that is to say impassible and immortal.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But let no one come to speak in a blasphemous manner of the corruption that results from sin, of which there was no trace in Christ, as we have said on numerous occasions; for it is by the fact that it has not sinned that the flesh is holy and incorruptible, (and that) from the union to the God Word. Thus Cyril, the divine sage, refuted Diodore, who declared that the holy body (was an) ordinary (body), and who, first, formed the child issued from Mary, following his own language, and then, made God dwell in it as by complacency: [CYRIL] "I say, my dear, that you utter foolish words and completely aberrant by their stupidity. The holy body indeed came from Mary, but from the beginning of its composition and of its constitution in the womb, it was holy, as the body of Christ, and one cannot see a moment when it was not his, but 'ordinary', as you say, and comparable to the other fleshes"<sup><a href="#fn169" id="ref169">169</a></sup>. He also apostrophizes the impious Theodore, who says that what had been lacking in holiness and in strength in the trial against the Enemy, had been supplied to our Savior the Christ by the inhabitation of the Holy Spirit in him under the form of a dove, and he declares the following: [CYRIL] "That one, opening his mouth wide and straying insatiably in blasphemy, declares that he was of a defective holiness and that he was not perfect under this (aspect), before the Holy Spirit descended upon him under the form of a dove. One must therefore say in truth: And how, was he not perfectly holy? That which is such is not exempt from sin; for he who is only partially holy, is equally conceived as being partially weak. Otherwise, what is the deficiency that one would estimate had been filled by the Holy Spirit so that he was rendered henceforth perfectly apt to be able to destroy even the assault of the demon and not to be deficient for all the rest, as the adversary said"<sup><a href="#fn170" id="ref170">170</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now he was not only holy and perfect under the aspect of holiness, but he was equally perfect by the power, he who healed the afflictions and the diseases of every kind. We confess even, in addition, that he is also vivifying, to the point of resurrecting the dead, from the moment of the union to the Word, substantial Power of God the Father: not that an operation from outside acted in him, as it acted also in the prophets and the apostles, who benefited from grace, but inasmuch as he was equal in power to the Word, because he was hypostatically united to him. Indeed, this same doctor, further on, in the same treatise, writes this: [CYRIL] "While he is God according to his nature and authentic son of God the Father, he became in a state of resemblance with men and he made his own the flesh issued from the holy Virgin: it is the flesh of God, full of the force that befits God. It is for this very reason that he is also vivifying, that he heals the sick and operates the destruction of death"<sup><a href="#fn171" id="ref171">171</a></sup>. Similar ideas to those also in the fifth book of the Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, when, discoursing concerning Simon's mother-in-law and the healing of the fever that overwhelmed her, he said: [CYRIL] "For he healed her as God, by gratifying with the contact of his hand her who lay. And for what reason? To show that his body was equal in power to his nature, I mean to that of the divinity, by its action on the sick. For it was the body, not of any man whatsoever, but of the Word who can strengthen everything"<sup><a href="#fn172" id="ref172">172</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore the reason for which he left a flesh, so perfect under the aspect of holiness and of vivifying operation that it even resurrected the dead, maintain itself in the same nature which is its own, mortal and despicable to the point of enduring the blows of the slaps and the spitting, and for which he rendered it, by the resurrection, immortal, full of glory and incorruptible, the doctors have clearly shown in what has been indicated above<sup><a href="#fn173" id="ref173">173</a></sup>: it is because Christ wanted to die our death, to undertake again, in conformity with justice, the combat for (repairing) our defeat and to make himself the way that (leads) us to glory and to resurrection. Indeed, the wise John, bishop of Constantinople, has said things that haunt the ears of those who hear them: [CHRYSOSTOM] "For Christ did not have a sinful flesh, but one which, while being similar to our (flesh) sinful, was without sin and by nature the same as ours; so that it also follows from this that the nature of the flesh is not evil. For it is not after having taken another flesh instead of the first or after having transformed this one in its nature, that Christ prepared it to resume the combat in this state; but leaving it to persist in the same nature which is its own, he made it gird a crown (of triumph) over sin, and then, after the victory, he resurrected it and rendered it immortal"<sup><a href="#fn174" id="ref174">174</a></sup>. And again: [CHRYSOSTOM] "... since the nature of the flesh had not yet been glorified, that it did not enjoy incorruptibility either and that it did not share the throne of royalty. That is why he did not say 'on the earth', but 'with you'. It is of this glory that we also will enjoy, if we have watched. And that is why Paul also said: 'If we suffer with him, we will also be glorified with him'<sup><a href="#fn175" id="ref175">175</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn176" id="ref176">176</a></sup>. Indeed, although the Emmanuel was filled with the glory from on high, since he possesses it naturally from the fact that he is God, nevertheless, at the time of his stripping and his sojourn among men, he in no way made his flesh shine with the glory that befits God, inaccessible to anyone. For it was fitting that he be visible and not imperceptible for the men among whom he evolved and for whom he had made himself man. That is why he willed that it be subject to the irreprehensible sufferings and to death, because he wanted, as we have said<sup><a href="#fn177" id="ref177">177</a></sup>, to undertake again, in conformity with justice, the combat for (repairing) our defeat and, by his resurrection, to inaugurate, from the flesh that was united to him, impassibility, incorruptibility and glory, and to establish, in favor of the entire human race of which he had been the first-fruits, these (privileges) so considerable and so marvelous, as well as the resurrection of those who believe in him and are justified in him.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But let no one consider as an opprobrium and an ignominy the fact that the very holy body of our Savior remained passible and mortal until the resurrection, and by that very fact corruptible! Indeed, if the Word of God lowered himself to this point for us from the divine height and the dwellings from on high, and if he became terrestrial from celestial, and slave from Lord that he was, estimating that, to compensate for all these (advantages), his unique glory resided only in our salvation, what is astonishing if, for our healing, he tolerated that his flesh, (coming) from the earth and from the seed of Abraham, consubstantial with us and (issued) from the Holy Virgin, hypostatically united to him, become subject to the sufferings and the tortures, to the opprobriums and to death, so that it might destroy them and win a legitimate victory over the empire of death and over Satan, who had prevailed over us, and so that, by the resurrection, it might become immortal and incorruptible, and that he who, wisely, had passed through all our (weaknesses), with the exception of sin, and who had lowered himself to the state of total stripping to deliver us from all the (shackles) in which we were held, might be glorified more. For it is not for his own profit that he came who had no need, who had no deficiency, but to become, by his flesh that was hypostatically united to him, the way and the first-fruits of the (goods) that will be reserved for us by the resurrection, so that in this way our condition also might imitate his, following a measure that is sufficient and appropriate.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, Saint Cyril also, in the eleventh book of the Commentary on the Gospel of John, gives us the following teaching: [CYRIL] "For just as we have vanquished corruption and death for this very reason that Christ, as man, is resurrected because of us and for us, by making of his resurrection the origin of the deliverance from death, and that the effect of (this) event has even truly extended to us, because he who had vanquished was of ours by the fact that he became man; and just as we have vanquished sin, because the latter had died previously in Christ, who certainly transmitted this good to us ourselves as to his own race, thus does he make that we on our side embolden ourselves to vanquish the world. For Christ, as man, has vanquished because of us, by becoming thereby a starting point, an access and a way for human nature. We, indeed, who previously faltered and were vanquished, have been comforted and we have been strengthened by the fact that our nature has been raised in him and has vanquished in him. For it is in him, as in the first-fruits, that we have all been raised and we have vanquished. For just as, if the head of a body is healthy, the rest of the members also are healthy, so also, since Christ, who is the head of the Church, has vanquished, we also, who are his members, have vanquished in him. For the victory of the head becomes that of the body. That is why he also said: 'Have confidence, I have vanquished the world'<sup><a href="#fn178" id="ref178">178</a></sup>. For he has vanquished as man and he has transmitted to us the power of vanquishing. For it is not as God that he has vanquished—what glory would there be in that?—but as man, so that we might not despair when we are tempted, knowing that he who, as man, has vanquished, will grant us also to vanquish. For he has not said: 'I have vanquished as God', but 'I have vanquished the world', that is to say: I, the man, I have vanquished. For if he had vanquished as God, the victory would not be ours; but since he has vanquished as man, we also, as men, we vanquish in him. For just as, by the fact that he died as man, we have all died in him, so also, by the fact that he has vanquished as man, we have all vanquished in him"<sup><a href="#fn179" id="ref179">179</a></sup>conquered thanks to him who, coming from us, also conquered for us: if he had conquered as God, it would have been nothing for us, but if he (did it) as man, it is in him that we have conquered. For we had 'a second Adam come from heaven' [as it is written]<sup><a href="#fn179" id="ref179">179</a></sup>. And further: [CYRIL] "When therefore the works were completed and when had arrived at the term that was fitting to God all that had been happily disposed for the economy, he returned to his own glory and took possession of his first honor. But while he was still clothed with human resemblance, he composed for himself an attitude of supplication and he supplicated as if he had possessed nothing: all that (happens) to man comes from God. For although, especially because he is God and begotten of God the Father, he was not deprived of the glory that befits God, nevertheless, given that during the time of the economy (realized) because of us he had so to speak contracted it by assuming this contemptible body, he supplicated for it justly as if it had been truly distant (from him)"<sup><a href="#fn180" id="ref180">180</a></sup>. And again, further on, he writes what we have reported above: [CYRIL] "It is therefore in all conformity with the economy that Our Lord Jesus-Christ, when he had not yet transformed his temple into the glory that is due to him and that suits him, appeared still in his first forms, because he did not want to make the truth of the resurrection appear in another form and in another body than the one he had taken from the Holy Virgin, in which he had died after the crucifixion, as it is written"<sup><a href="#fn181" id="ref181">181</a></sup>. From then it is the same who was Lord of glory, as God, and who was glorified, as man, because he became for us without change; and he glorified himself, by becoming the initiator of a similar glory for us, for whom he became the first-born from the dead<sup><a href="#fn182" id="ref182">182</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">This teaching is also clearly given to us by the apostolic doctor Athanasius, in the discourse On the apparition of the God Word in the flesh: [ATHANASIUS] "It is therefore manifest that it is in the flesh that the Son, the Word of God, was touched; and in both cases the divine Scripture has transmitted to us that it was the Word of life who had been touched<sup><a href="#fn183" id="ref183">183</a></sup>. And when it says: 'There was not yet the Holy Spirit, because Jesus had not yet been glorified'<sup><a href="#fn184" id="ref184">184</a></sup>, it is of his flesh that it declared that it had not yet been glorified. For it is not the Lord of glory who is glorified, but the flesh of the Lord of glory itself which received the glory, when it was elevated to heaven with him. And it is thus that the Spirit of adoption was not yet in men, because the flesh, which had been taken as first-fruits among men, had not yet ascended to heaven. All that Scripture therefore says: 'the Son took' and 'the Son was glorified', it said it of his humanity and not of his divinity"<sup><a href="#fn185" id="ref185">185</a></sup>. And again in the third book of On the Trinity against the Arians, he writes as follows: [ATHANASIUS] "For we must perfectly know this, that nothing of what he said he received did he receive as if he did not possess it, for he possessed it from all time because he is the God Word. But it is said now that he received according to humanity, so that, his flesh taking them in him, henceforth (these goods) emanating from it might be firmly established in us"<sup><a href="#fn186" id="ref186">186</a></sup>. There is therefore no reason to doubt that it is the same. As Word and God, he was Lord of glory, perfect in all and complete under whatever aspect, to the point that, when he showed only a faint ray of it to his disciples on the mountain, — in the measure where it can be represented by the radiance of the sensible sun, — they did not even bear the sight of it, but fell face to the ground. But it is as he became man that, disposing the economy of our salvation and tracing the way for conditions that are ours, as has been said<sup><a href="#fn187" id="ref187">187</a></sup>, he tolerated that his flesh be, following its nature, subject to suffering, to death and to opprobrium, so that the Word himself, who cannot undergo any of these (weaknesses), might be said to have also undergone the opprobrium, the suffering and the death. And it is for this that he became incarnate, in a flesh naturally apt to undergo all that, so that the Impassible might be said to have suffered, because of the flesh, in which the sufferings acted and remained, and that he who is full of glory might be recognized to have been glorified by the resurrection and the ascension to heaven, the flesh resplendent with the glory that befits God. And all this had been established by him, as by (our) first-fruits, with a view to our resurrection and our (elevation) to the celestial rank, thanks to (the identity of) race and to the consubstantiality (with us). Indeed, the same Athanasius, in the same discourse, had previously said this also: [ATHANASIUS] "So that the grace might be inamissible and that it might be firmly kept by men, it is for this that he considers as his the gift and says he received, as man, the power that he held from all time as God; and he declares: 'Glorify me'<sup><a href="#fn188" id="ref188">188</a></sup>, he who glorifies others, to show that he has a flesh that needs these (advantages). From then, as the flesh of the Word received them, — and it is by assuming (this flesh) that he became man, — and since the one who received them is in him, he is said himself to have received them"<sup><a href="#fn189" id="ref189">189</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Julius also, who was a star of the Roman Church and who spoke according to the spirit of the authentic doctrine of Athanasius, wrote things that agree with this in the work entitled On the union in Christ, that is to say of his body with his divinity: [JULIUS] "And when he says: 'Glorify me', it is from the body that (this) word comes and it is the body that the glory concerns, while it is said concerning the whole, since the whole is one. And by adding further: 'With the glory that I had with you, before the world was'<sup><a href="#fn190" id="ref190">190</a></sup>, he aimed at the divinity always glorified; and although this concerned properly the divinity, it was said nevertheless globally of the composite. And it is thus that he is and consubstantial to God according to the invisible spirit, the flesh also being understood under this name, since it is united to him who is consubstantial to God, and, on the other hand, consubstantial to men, the divinity being taken also with the body, since it is united to him who is consubstantial to us: the nature of the body changes neither by its union to him who is consubstantial to God nor by its association to the name of 'consubstantial to us', just as the nature of the divinity also has not been changed by (its) association to the human body nor by the appellation of 'flesh consubstantial to us'"<sup><a href="#fn191" id="ref191">191</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">These pitiable beings, Diodore and Theodore, have therefore ignored that our Savior and Lord Jesus-Christ is a unique Son and that he is, the same, full of glory by the fact that he is God by nature, and that he is, the same, glorified by the fact that he became incarnate and became man because of us; but they divide the one who is one into two sons and they declare that one is the authentic Son of God the Father, that he is Lord of glory as God issued from God, and that the other, taken by himself, is a man, that he (is issued) from the seed of David and from Mary, and that, having come from outside, he was assumed by grace by virtue of a very particular predilection of the God Word and that he acquires by this title, as by gratification and by mark of honor, to be called Son of God and to have in sharing the glory and the filiation, following what they recount in their folly. Also they are confounded by the very wise Cyril, when, writing against them, he teaches that the Emmanuel, because he is one, possesses all by nature, both the glory and the fact of being authentic son and all that befits God; that he has nothing that was acquired afterwards and of which he was gratified from outside, since he is recognized God issued from God, and that he did not lose what he was, — he is indeed immutable, — while having become truly man. Now in what pertains to the refutation of Diodore, his language is thus known: [CYRIL] "He even dares to clothe with appearances proper to the Lord him who, as he said himself, is a man issued from Mary, who, from the beginning, differed in nothing from us, but at the most, after he came out of the womb, was rendered worthy of the name of filiation and of the glory of God. They are therefore two sons, according to what you have said, the Christ is a new God and he was crowned by God with an honor that surpasses nature to a degree somewhat superior to the creatures, so that he who, afterwards, acquired the glory, might be adored with the ordinary man, understand by perfecting the holy and consubstantial Trinity"<sup><a href="#fn192" id="ref192">192</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">And addressing Nestorius, in the fourth tome Against his blasphemies, he brings out the senseless and corrupt character of this opinion and declares: [CYRIL] "Thus therefore, if the Son is said to be glorified by the Father, appreciate in your spirit the measure of the humanity; do not divide the unique Christ, Son and Lord, into two, but confess that the incarnate God is one and the same, and similarly that the same is, as God, Lord of glory and that he has, according to humanity, received the glory"<sup><a href="#fn193" id="ref193">193</a></sup>. And again in the fifth tome, he shows that at the resurrection he vivified the flesh that had undergone death: [CYRIL] "When therefore you hear the theophore Paul say: 'He was crucified by reason of (his) weakness, but it is by the power of God that he lives'<sup><a href="#fn194" id="ref194">194</a></sup>, understand it conformably to the faith. He says indeed that he suffered according to humanity, while, according to his nature, he was totally above suffering. Being in this state, he submitted to the flesh of bile and, after having borne to die according to humanity, he resurrected according to divinity, himself vivifying his temple, inasmuch as he is the power of the Father"<sup><a href="#fn195" id="ref195">195</a></sup>. Similarly also in the hundred and twenty-eighth homily of his writings On the gospel of Luke, he says: [CYRIL] "While he is God by nature, he is said, once become man, to have received from the Father a name above all names<sup><a href="#fn196" id="ref196">196</a></sup>, so that it might be known that he was God and king of all, even with his flesh that had been united to him. But after having endured for us the sufferings on the cross and having, by his resurrection from the dead, destroyed and banished death from his body, he ascended to his Father"<sup><a href="#fn197" id="ref197">197</a></sup>. And in the twelfth book of the Commentary on the gospel of Matthew he says similar things: [CYRIL] "For by the resurrection from the dead the nature of men was again rendered to incorruptibility, after a similar event had first occurred in Christ. It is for this that he is also called second Adam<sup><a href="#fn198" id="ref198">198</a></sup>, first-fruits of those who sleep<sup><a href="#fn199" id="ref199">199</a></sup> and first-born from the dead<sup><a href="#fn200" id="ref200">200</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn201" id="ref201">201</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Here it appears also from these texts that the way, the door and the first-fruits of the resurrection of all nature, that is to say of the entire human genus, were facts that had been accomplished in Christ our Savior, who is the second Adam, the first-fruits of those who sleep and the first-born from the dead. For his intention was not this, to reveal solely the excellence of the power of his divinity, but, having regard to the weakness of men, to obtain for them the healing and to propose himself to them as the order and the disposition of the goods that were to pass from him to us and (there) remain permanently, as the apostolic doctor Athanasius says: [ATHANASIUS] "So that the grace might be inamissible and that it might be firmly kept by men"<sup><a href="#fn202" id="ref202">202</a></sup>. Indeed, it is not because the Word of God could not, from the moment of the union to his flesh, show it impassible, immortal and resplendent with a glory inaccessible to anyone, that he waited until the moment of the resurrection, but it is in order to become the principle of our resurrection, of our immortality, of our incorruptibility and of our glory that he humbled himself and that he reduced also, as much as was possible, having regard to his sublime mercy, what is proper to him to the norm of our measures; in proposing to us his resurrection as a model and a figure exceeding all measure, that should follow all that pertains to the resurrection, to the immortality and to the incorruptibility of those who believe in him. This is clearly confirmed also, in the second book of the Treasure, by the eminent Cyril, who writes this: [CYRIL] "First-born also from the dead<sup><a href="#fn203" id="ref203">203</a></sup> for it is he who first elevated his flesh to incorruptibility, he who first made it ascend to heaven. It is for this that he said: I am the way<sup><a href="#fn204" id="ref204">204</a></sup> and I am the door<sup><a href="#fn205" id="ref205">205</a></sup>: it is by him that human nature was instructed to engage on the new road of the resurrection to enter, as by a door, into heaven itself"<sup><a href="#fn206" id="ref206">206</a></sup>. And again: [CYRIL] "Just as he has been called the first-born of many brothers<sup><a href="#fn207" id="ref207">207</a></sup>, because those who have been saved by him have been called by grace to the divine adoption, and again the first-born and the first-fruits from the dead<sup><a href="#fn208" id="ref208">208</a></sup>, by the fact that he himself, before all, resurrected for incorruptibility, thus he is said to have been created beginning of the ways<sup><a href="#fn209" id="ref209">209</a></sup> by the fact that by him henceforth each one can tend to salvation"<sup><a href="#fn210" id="ref210">210</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Now just as the doctors of the Church clearly make understood that the flesh of our great God and Savior the Christ received incorruptibility by the resurrection, by the fact that it became impassible and immortal, thus they also gloriously teach this other thing: that the adorable flesh is incorruptible, according as it is holy and without sin, from the moment of the union to the Word. And so as not to bring a disproportionate development to the present exposition, which is easy, we will learn that also, with the doctrinal testimonies that have been cited, by the word of the very wise Cyril, that your Piety also has cited, which is found in the book called Scholia and is thus conceived: [CYRIL] "Here then is what must very opportunely and very justly be conceived: because the God Word, by whom all has been made, wanted to save what was lost, by condescension to our regard, he lowered himself to what he was not, so that human nature might become exactly what it was not, by being glorified with the honor of the transcendent and divine power by the union with him; and the body was truly elevated to heights that surpass nature, or again he lowered to conditions that are outside of nature him who is immutable, as God. It was fitting that the Incorruptible participate in the nature submitted to corruption, to snatch it from corruption. It was fitting that he who did not know how to sin become conformed to those who were submitted to sin, so that he might destroy sin. For indeed, just as where there is light, darkness is absolutely without effect, thus, in the presence of incorruptibility, it was absolutely necessary that corruption be eclipsed and that he who ignored sin, by making his own what is submitted to sin, destroy sin"<sup><a href="#fn211" id="ref211">211</a></sup>. This shows very clearly, and without any contestation, that, as soon as the God Word had in sharing our corruptible nature, understand that he became incarnate and made man, — for he took from the seed of Abraham, following what is written<sup><a href="#fn212" id="ref212">212</a></sup>, — the corruption, which is understood to be that of sin, fled, because of him who did not know how to sin, by distancing itself like darkness. For on this subject the Doctor clearly specified his language; indeed, when he says: "it was fitting that the incorruptible participate in the nature submitted to corruption to liberate it from corruption", explaining of what corruption he had spoken, he added: "it was fitting that he who did not know how to sin become conformed to us who are submitted to sin, so that he might destroy sin". And again, applying himself laboriously to explain with great precision the same idea and confirming it with a promptitude firm and exempt from discussion and contestation, he declares: "For indeed just as where there is light, darkness is truly without effect, thus, in the presence of incorruptibility, it was absolutely necessary that corruption flee from it". And to show what is the corruption that flees by the fact that the Incorruptible assumed a flesh that is submitted to corruption, and that by the very fact the light appeared, he immediately added again this: "He who ignored sin made his own what is submitted to sin, to destroy sin".</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore, as the language of the Doctor clearly proclaims to us that from the moment when the Word of God took a flesh, the corruption of sin fled from it and that there did not even remain any trace of it, — for he did not commit sin, following what is written, and no deceit was found in his mouth<sup><a href="#fn213" id="ref213">213</a></sup>, — I am astonished, — permit me to speak frankly, since it is a question of the truth, — of the manner in which your Holiness has cited this argument and other similar ones, as if truly they served your own design! For there is no one who disputes concerning the corruption that resides in sin. All, indeed, we confess that the flesh of our God and Savior the Christ is holy and without sin, and under that aspect incorruptible, from the beginning of the divine inhumanation, as we have said previously<sup><a href="#fn214" id="ref214">214</a></sup>; but what was sought and what was submitted to debate is this: that you demonstrate that the flesh was not mortal before the resurrection, but indeed immortal from the moment of the union to the Word and that it was, under that aspect, incorruptible as well as by the fact that it was not subject to the irreprehensible sufferings nor naturally apt to suffer, to be corrupted and to undergo the experience of death. You have indeed seen how we have reported that the doctors of the holy Church say that it is in a mortal body, subject to sufferings and to death and naturally apt to be corrupted, that Christ our God and Savior suffered and tasted death, and that it is by the resurrection that he rendered impassible, immortal and incorruptible what was passible, mortal and corruptible. Moreover, the testimony that was found, you said, in the book that demonstrates that The Christ is one, and which is cited in reality in the book called Scholia, we have found that it declares that the body is incorruptible by the fact that it is holy and pure of sin from the moment of the union to the Word. It is thus known: [CYRIL] "The tabernacle was erected in the desert by the will of God. The Emmanuel was represented there under multiple symbols. The God of the universe said therefore to the holy Moses: 'And you will make the ark of the testimonies of wood that does not rot. Its length will be two cubits and a half, its width two cubits and a half and its height one cubit and a half. And you will cover it with gold inside and you will cover it outside'<sup><a href="#fn215" id="ref215">215</a></sup>. But the wood that does not rot will be the symbol of the incorruptible body, for the wood of cedar does not rot. As for the gold, as matter more precious than the others, it signifies to us the excellence of the divine essence"<sup><a href="#fn216" id="ref216">216</a></sup>. The name of fir is also given to this imperishable wood of which the ark was constructed. Your Holiness has cited the testimony up to here; now when one supplies the elements that are missing from the text, they make understood what is the incorruptibility of the body from the moment of the union to the Word. Here are these elements: [CYRIL] "Notice how the entire ark was covered with pure gold inside and outside. It is that the Word of God was united to a holy flesh. And that is what represents, in my opinion, the fact that the ark was covered with gold outside. And that he made his own the intelligent soul that was in the body, that is what indicates the fact that he imposed the obligation to cover it with gold also inside"<sup><a href="#fn217" id="ref217">217</a></sup>. Here that the addition of these words has shown how the flesh was incorruptible by the union to the Word, since the sage clearly indicates to us: "For the Word who is God was united to a holy flesh". From then, under the aspect of holiness and absence of sin, the flesh was incorruptible from the moment of the union to the Word, but under the aspect of impassibility and immortality (it was so only) since the resurrection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">It was indeed fitting that it was in a mortal and passible body that the Emmanuel endured the sufferings for us, that he die our death and that he render their force inoperative by the resurrection. This very thing is again confirmed, with all the similar testimonies, by Saint Cyril; indeed, in the ninth book of On worship in spirit, where he elucidates this question concerning the ark, he declares that the Word of God vivified from the dead, by the resurrection the third day, his flesh that was holy by its union with it and that he rendered it incorruptible, he who had proclaimed to the Jews: "Destroy this temple and the third day I will raise it up"<sup><a href="#fn218" id="ref218">218</a></sup>, a declaration that he would not have made, if it was from the moment of the incarnation that the flesh had been impassible and immortal. Indeed, impassible and immortal, how should it be rendered alive by the resurrection? The text is thus conceived: [CYRIL] "Behold, the ark<sup><a href="#fn219" id="ref219">219</a></sup> will therefore be for us the symbol and the image of Christ. For, in examining the mode of the inhumanation of the Monogenes, we see that the Word issued from the Father dwelt in the temple issued from the Virgin as in the ark. 'In him, indeed, has dwelt all the plenitude of the divinity corporeally' following what is written<sup><a href="#fn220" id="ref220">220</a></sup> and, on the other hand, it was the Word of God that the testimonies contained in the ark. Its woods were imperishable and they shone with pure and precious gold inside and outside. It is that the body of Christ was incorruptible, preserved as it was in incorruptibility, as by pure gold, by the power and the splendor of the Word who dwelt in it and by the nature and the vivifying action of the Holy Spirit. And from then it is also for this that Christ is called Life<sup><a href="#fn221" id="ref221">221</a></sup>. By the fact, indeed, that he is Life by nature, the Word issued from God the Father, by the virtue of his Holy Spirit, vivified himself his temple and placed it above corruption. For his flesh did not see corruptibility, following the word of the Saint<sup><a href="#fn222" id="ref222">222</a></sup>. On the other hand he also proclaimed somewhere to the Jews: 'Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up'. And Peter also said: 'He underwent death in the flesh, but he was alive as to the Spirit'<sup><a href="#fn223" id="ref223">223</a></sup>. Gold is therefore the symbol of the divinity in its transcendent splendor, which was so to speak spread over the holy body and depositing its splendor and its incorruptibility in an ineffable manner and such as only the divine nature knows and which surpasses all understanding"<sup><a href="#fn224" id="ref224">224</a></sup>. Here that the incorruptibility that follows the resurrection of the dead, which the God Word had deposited in his flesh by his union with it, he reported it to the time of the resurrection, by saying that it was realized after the temple was destroyed and again after he died according to the flesh. He writes things similar to those in the tenth book of the same treatise; here they are: [CYRIL] "Indeed, one day truly indicates to us the venerable and salutary time, when the Monogenes made man, by the death of his flesh, won to God the Father those who are on the earth. The time of it is truly unique; for he died only once and he will die no more, death will have no more hold on him, following what is written<sup><a href="#fn225" id="ref225">225</a></sup>. For we no longer await that the Son die again for us nor for the spirits who are in hell, nor that he become the second first-fruits of those who sleep. Indeed, if death does not occur, how will there be resurrection?"<sup><a href="#fn226" id="ref226">226</a></sup>. And further still: [CYRIL] "Thus therefore it is a sign assuredly famous and brilliant, which suffices for the faith of those who have a right spirit, the fact that he is God by nature and issued, as Son, from God the Father, that he destroyed death and that it is in him, the first, that what was submitted to death and to corruption flowered again to life. For it is he who became the first-fruits of those who sleep and the first-born from the dead<sup><a href="#fn227" id="ref227">227</a></sup>. And this sign was given to the sons of disobedience, so that they might know that by the will of God the Father, Christ became for us a holy pontiff, innocent, without stain, distinct from sinners and elevated above the heavens<sup><a href="#fn228" id="ref228">228</a></sup>, following what is written"<sup><a href="#fn229" id="ref229">229</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

        <p class="paragraph">And what Saint Gregory, Bishop of Nyssa, says is equally true and entirely proper to the Emmanuel, that his birth did not take its origin from a passion and that his death did not result in corruption: [GREGORY] "For neither was concupiscence at the origin of his birth, nor did his death result in corruption"<sup><a href="#fn229" id="ref229">229</a></sup>. And this other thing that he adds is also devoid of falsehood: [GREGORY] "He escapes the common character of our nature, both by the mode of his birth and by the fact that he does not admit any alteration leading to corruption"<sup><a href="#fn230" id="ref230">230</a></sup>. Let us therefore question this wise and divine mystagogue: How did corruption not follow death? Would it be because our Savior Christ is said to have suffered and died in a flesh that is not subject to suffering and death? Not at all! But he answers us by saying: Because the resurrection succeeded death. That is why I said that death did not turn into corruption and suffering. On the contrary, he is beyond all suffering and corruption, he who is resurrected above all (forces of) nature and who destroyed the power of death. But if it pleases you, let us hear his word which is presented as follows: [GREGORY] "For he who spoke of birth, also added 'of the Virgin', and he who recalled death, attested, with death, the resurrection. If therefore, basing yourself on what you hear, you concede that he died and that he was born, you will in any case also concede, on this same basis, that his birth and death are beyond suffering. But all this surpasses nature. Also, he is not ranked among the things of nature, he who appears to be ranked among the things that surpass nature"<sup><a href="#fn231" id="ref231">231</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">While things are expressed thus, Your Holiness composes the following reasoning and says: If the generation of Christ according to the flesh took its origin from incorruption and if it passed into incorruption, we are in every way constrained to admit also that what happened in the interval unfolded in incorruption. And to this end you have demonstrated that the voluntary and irreproachable sufferings, hunger, fatigue, thirst, sleep, trouble, sadness and anguish, flagellation, blows, and the cross are not indices of a corruptible and passible body, but (of a body) incorruptible and impassible. These ideas which are yours are presented thus in their statement: [JULIAN] "Corruption did not succeed death, just as it did not precede the incarnation either. Well then, this point which they doubt — that by the fact that he assumed in the interval the traits that pertain to our weakness, he who took these sufferings is not incorruptible — this point has been clarified by the end"<sup><a href="#fn232" id="ref232">232</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And again elsewhere: [JULIAN] "How, concerning the Lord, who was not in corruption, neither at the beginning nor at the end, are we not much more constrained to confess that his conduct among men, which unfolded in the interval, was also exempt from corruption?"<sup><a href="#fn233" id="ref233">233</a></sup>. These texts denote a disposition of mind that is manifestly distant from the requirements of the question proposed to us. For the Emmanuel had a conduct exempt from corruption, he passed through displaying an activity entirely virtuous and worthy of praise as long as he moved among men, following what is written<sup><a href="#fn234" id="ref234">234</a></sup>, and he presented himself as an example of virtue, as first-fruits for those who follow him: which Christian would think to deny it? And what is conduct other than acts and ways of behaving? Now, the fact that has been submitted to us is the following — it is indeed the same thing that I repeat many times — it is that Your Holiness makes it understood that the body of God the Savior was incorruptible and impassible not inasmuch as it was holy and of a conduct exempt from sin — that, everyone will likewise confess — but inasmuch as it was neither mortal nor subject to irreprehensible sufferings, the God Word permitting, by his will, that it experience what is proper to it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Let us therefore listen to Gregory, the wise theologian, who had declared that neither the birth of the Emmanuel according to the flesh nor his death had the common character of our nature, both because of the virginity (preserved) even after his birth of she who had borne him and because of his resurrection which befitted a God. How did he say concerning him: of evil passions, which are sicknesses of the spirit, which entail the guilt of sin and are passions in the proper sense, not the slightest trace was found in him, but of the others, natural and irreprehensible, he underwent the experience in a flesh that was subject to passions, which must not be called passions in the proper sense because they are exempt from reproach. He speaks in this manner in the Catechetical Discourse: [GREGORY] "There is a passion that is properly called such and a passion that is improperly called such. That which therefore reaches the spirit and turns it from virtue towards evil is a passion in the proper sense; that which, on the contrary, unfolding according to its order, appears to proceed by way of natural consequence, that one is more exactly called an action and not a passion, like birth, growth, the subsistence of the body thanks to the intake and evacuation of food, the concurrence of elements assembling in it and again the dissolution of the composite and their passage into neighboring substances. Of what then did our mystery say that the divinity had approached? Is it of the passion which, in the proper sense, is said to be malice? Or of a movement conformable to nature? For if the exposition had the pretension to establish that the divinity was (mixed) with shameful things, we should have had to deviate from the aberration of a doctrine that would have said nothing healthy about the divine nature. But if (God) is said to have approached the nature that is ours and holds from the beginning its first origin and subsistence from him, by what side does the preaching deviate from the thought that befits God, since it does not introduce into the notions of the faith relative to God the slightest suspicion of possibility coming from sin? For we do not say of the doctor who treats someone in the grip of suffering that he is (himself) affected by it; but rather that he bends over the sickness, he who brings the remedy remains outside the suffering"<sup><a href="#fn235" id="ref235">235</a></sup>. For it is evident that, although the God Word experienced in his flesh the irreprehensible passions, he was nevertheless, even in these conditions, impassible. He also uses very clearly the same expression in the fourth discourse of what he had written Against the Impious Eunomius: [GREGORY] "Therefore the passion which, in the proper sense, is a sickness of the spirit, he did not have a share in it — for he committed no sin and there is no deceit in his mouth<sup><a href="#fn236" id="ref236">236</a></sup> — but to those which are proper to our nature and which, by habit and by analogy, are also called passions, we confess that Our Lord had a share in them: in birth, in nutrition, in growth, in sleep, in fatigue, and in all that pertains to bodily pains, where the soul is naturally associated with the body; such are also the desire for a necessary thing which, through the intermediary of the body's concupiscence, extends to the soul, the feeling of sadness, the dread of death, and all sentiments of this nature, with the exception of what leads to adhering to sin"<sup><a href="#fn237" id="ref237">237</a></sup>. And again in the writing entitled 'Against the Exposition' of Eunomius, he writes the following: [GREGORY] "Thus the Word also, when he became flesh, assumed, with the flesh, the entire human nature. Whence being hungry and thirsty, fearing and being terrified, desiring, sleeping, being troubled, weeping, and all acts of this nature had the occasion to occur in him. For neither is the divinity subjected by its nature to any similar passion, nor does the flesh, taken by itself, ever become the prey of these sentiments without the soul being associated with it"<sup><a href="#fn238" id="ref238">238</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">By these words, the doctor has taught us that, although Christ, Word of God, was born gloriously according to the flesh from a Virgin in a manner that surpasses nature, and that he resurrected again above the common laws of nature thanks to an entirely divine virtue, nevertheless, on account of the natural passions, which are not said to be passions in the proper sense since they imply no guilt of sin, he was not outside of community with us when, by his will, he became their prey and permitted his flesh to proceed according to what is proper to its nature, whenever it appeared to him that it would be good for him. And it is therefore by this that he also experienced the desire for food and was susceptible to experiencing the suffering of hunger. And again, initiating us into the desire for virtuous actions, so that they might come to us as from their first-fruits and that we might learn and find the strength not to come to desire what is profitable to the body but what pleases God, it is with eagerness that he hastened towards the cross (that he would undergo) for us. He said indeed to the disciples: 'I have greatly desired to eat this Passover'<sup><a href="#fn239" id="ref239">239</a></sup>. And he also took upon himself the suffering of fright, trouble, and sadness which are proper to the flesh endowed with an intelligent soul, and courageously he approached voluntary death, so that by acceding to it, he might restrain the violence of similar passions and transplant from his flesh, as from their root, courage and confidence into the entire human race of which, becoming man, he had become the first-fruits. It is for this indeed that he also tasted in his flesh the experience of death and that he acceded to the condition of a mortal, with the intention of strengthening in us the life of the resurrection, and not to procure for himself some advantage or because he had need of life, he who lives perpetually by the fact that he is God and Word issued from God the Father. It is again indeed what Gregory, the wise in the Spirit, writes in these terms in the Catechetical Discourse: [GREGORY] "For it is not because he had need of life that he who is from all eternity lowered himself to bodily birth, but to bring us back from death to life. Because it was necessary therefore that there be a return of our nature from death, as if he had stretched out his hand to what had fallen, having therefore lowered himself to our fall, he approached death to the point of reaching our mortal condition and of giving to nature a sketch of the resurrection, by resurrecting with him, so to speak, in his own body, the whole man"<sup><a href="#fn240" id="ref240">240</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore all the natural and guiltless sufferings he assumed in a flesh that was subject to them, so that, by each one of them, he might procure health for us who were sick, that by going to the experience of death, he might destroy death, to which we were condemned as a result of sin, and that, by the resurrection of his body, he might resurrect with him the entire human race and restore it to the grace of immortality, which our father Adam had stripped away because of the serpent's cunning; for the resurrection is nothing other than the return to the primitive state. If the Word of God indeed became man without change, it is not to the point of recusing the stripping and poverty to which he reduced himself by his will, of neglecting and despising all that pertains to the state of humiliation and to humanity, and of moving only in the conditions from on high and those that befit God, of showing (in this way) the superfluous character of his incarnation. Also, although he could, as God, even without food, provide for the subsistence of his flesh, he did not refuse to associate with us in this respect and other similar ones, showing that not only was his flesh consubstantial with us, but also suffering like ours. Those indeed who do not speak thus, tacitly deny the fact that he is consubstantial with us, only profiting from the expression with their lips. Now again Saint Gregory, in the Catechetical Discourse, declares this: [GREGORY] "But the Word of God, as has been said in what precedes, who is equally God and Word, mingled with the human nature, and when he had become in a body that is ours, he did not institute another (mode) of subsistence for the nature, but it is by means that are customary and appropriate to it that he ensures the duration of his body by maintaining its subsistence by food and drink"<sup><a href="#fn241" id="ref241">241</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">You see therefore how it is not fitting to decree and say: if the birth from a virgin and the resurrection, if the beginning and the end unfolded following new proprieties and surpassing the common character of our nature, it is absolutely necessary to exclude also from equality with the common character of our nature the other aspects. For the Doctor proclaims that God the Savior did not institute a new (mode) of subsistence for the nature of his body. This is what he says in the fourth discourse of the Commentary on the Beatitudes in the following manner: [GREGORY] "He who had everything in common with us except sin and who had in common the same sufferings as us, did not judge that hunger was a sin and did not exclude the suffering of hunger from his temptation, but he took upon himself the vehement covetousness of nature for food. For, after having remained forty days without food, he finally felt hunger<sup><a href="#fn242" id="ref242">242</a></sup>: it is that he conceded, when he willed it, to nature to do what was proper to it"<sup><a href="#fn243" id="ref243">243</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And Proclus of holy memory, in the Letter to the Armenians, writes similar things: [PROCLUS] "The God Word therefore became perfect man, without this prodigy which surpasses understanding having diminished the immutable nature. But this very thing we have learned by faith and we have not attained it by investigation. And, having become man, he redeemed, in what suffered like us, the race that was associated with him according to the flesh, by the fact that he abolished the debt of sin by dying for all, as man, and that he destroyed him who held the power of death, that is, Satan, as God who hates evil<sup><a href="#fn244" id="ref244">244</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn245" id="ref245">245</a></sup>. And a little further still: [PROCLUS] "If there are those for whom the swaddling clothes, the deposition in a manger, the progress of the years according to the flesh, sleeping in a boat and being fatigued by the difficulty of the journey, being hungry sometimes, and all the characters which according to the order befit him who truly became man, have been a cause of scandal, let them know that by despising the sufferings they recuse the nature. Now by recusing the nature, they do not believe in the economy, and by not believing in the economy, they render the redemption inoperative. For if, from the origin of creation, a man had been born in the world, who had walked by another road deviating from that of nature, let these quarrelers show him and then let them compose their insane fables. But if it is this state that marks the beginning of common nature, and the God Word truly became man, why, while professing the nature, do they censure the sufferings? Let them therefore choose one of two things: either, if they are ashamed of the sufferings, let them recuse the nature and be ranked among the impious, as they share the ideas of the Manicheans, or, if they admit the benefit resulting from the inhumanation by confessing the nature, let them not be ashamed of the sufferings that befit nature"<sup><a href="#fn246" id="ref246">246</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">We also remember that Saint John, Bishop of Constantinople, declared and taught concerning our God and Savior Christ, in the texts cited above, ideas similar to that one: [CHRYSOSTOM] "He puts the accent very well on the humanity and the nature that does not want to die, but that claims to live the life here below, indicating that it was not outside of human passions. For just as there is no culpability in being hungry, nor in sleeping, there is none either in taking pleasure in the life here below. Now Christ had a body pure of sins, but not detached from natural necessities, otherwise there would not have been a body"<sup><a href="#fn247" id="ref247">247</a></sup>. And we have again heard the doctor writing, as emanating from the person of Christ addressing the disciples: [CHRYSOSTOM] "You, indeed, will see me resurrected. And what does 'new' mean? In a new way, that is to say which is not customary, from the fact that I do not have a passible body, but henceforth immortal and incorruptible and not experiencing the need for nourishment. It is therefore not by need that he ate and drank after the resurrection — for henceforth the body no longer experienced the need for it — but to confirm by this the fact of the resurrection"<sup><a href="#fn248" id="ref248">248</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The very wise Cyril, for his part, expounds the following in what he wrote To the faithful queens: [CYRIL] "When he had fasted sufficiently and when, by an entirely divine force, without resorting to food and drink, he had kept his flesh safe from corruption, he permitted it at most to undergo what is proper to it. For he is said to have been hungry; and for what reason? So that by these two aspects he might be wisely recognized to be both God and man, one and the same, above us according to divinity and like us according to humanity"<sup><a href="#fn249" id="ref249">249</a></sup>. Who therefore, hearing this, would not glorify with innumerable praises the herald so precise of the divine teachings? He has indeed shown everything at once: both that he is God incarnate who, in an entirely divine manner, persevered in the fast and who, by his will, took upon himself the suffering of hunger; and that in truth, the same, he was hungry according to humanity, he who, as he is God, during all those days, did not care about food. He says indeed: "he permitted at most his flesh to undergo what is proper to it", indicating by this "at most" what befits God and revealing that it was possible for him to conserve his flesh perfectly without resorting to food. By elsewhere, in saying that he "underwent what is proper to it", he made it understood that he was subject to hunger, not that he would have only been considered, by virtue of a false conception, as affected by a suffering that was foreign to him, but that he truly underwent what is proper and fitting to him; for he also experienced the need for nourishment to sustain himself, because he wanted, the Word of God himself, to confirm, by all these guiltless sufferings, his authentic inhumanation. We have indeed heard Saint Gregory who, in the Catechetical Discourse, wrote concerning our God and Savior this: [GREGORY] "He did not institute another (mode) of subsistence for the nature, but it is by means that are customary and appropriate to it that he ensured the subsistence of his body by food and drink"<sup><a href="#fn250" id="ref250">250</a></sup>. This is what the eminent Cyril likewise made known to us, when, in the words cited above, he speaks to us of our God and Savior in this way: [CYRIL] "And by an entirely divine force, without resorting to food and drink, he kept his flesh safe from corruption"<sup><a href="#fn251" id="ref251">251</a></sup>. He brought out by this two things: both that the flesh was naturally apt to be nourished and that it is by an entirely divine force that he kept it safe from corruption, the deprivation of food and hunger being a suffering that provokes the corruption and dissolution of the subsistence of the body. For experiencing the need for food and being hungry is the proper of a corruptible, passible, and mortal body, and not an immortal, incorruptible, and impassible one. Indeed, the holy Bishop John also, speaking of our Savior resurrected from the dead, said — I attest many times to the same words to show the agreement of the doctors —: [CHRYSOSTOM] "From the fact that I do not have a passible body, but henceforth immortal and incorruptible and not experiencing the need for nourishment. It is therefore not by need that he ate and drank after the resurrection — for henceforth the body no longer experienced the need for it"<sup><a href="#fn252" id="ref252">252</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Thus all the venerable Fathers and theophoric doctors say therefore that the body of God who became man without change is exempt from sin, that it is in no way subject to the corruption resulting from sin, that it knows suffering like us, insofar as it is subject to the natural necessities of irreprehensible sufferings, and that it experiences the need for nourishment, the Word made man permitting and willing that his body follow, passible and corruptible, the natural law; but after the resurrection it is henceforth impassible and incorruptible and, by that very fact, manifestly immortal also and no longer experiencing the need for nourishment, from the fact that the experience of sufferings and death, which a mortal and naturally apt to suffer body had necessarily to approach, was once vanquished and that he won for us over them a victory conformed to the exigencies of justice. How then to demonstrate that what Your Piety wrote concords with this: [JULIAN] "And they add that eating, drinking, growing, and progressing are proper to the corruptible nature and susceptible to diminution and transformation from a deficient state to perfection: they have as fathers of similar doctrines those who divide him who is one into two natures"? But it is easy, friend of God, to oppose a contradiction to this: we will establish the truth from the doctrine of the holy Fathers and we will dissipate the stain that tarnishes it, following the conception found in those who, in an impious manner, divide the Emmanuel into two natures and who make subsist outside the Word of God, on the other hand, the man who, as they add, is the Christ issued from Mary, himself imperfect, they say, under the aspect of virtue and who, by works of renunciation, grew and progressed to perfection. They are reproached, and very justly, for sharing the opinion of the Jews and for reducing a mystery of justice, truly great, to idolatry and for introducing into the holy Trinity a man whose progress in virtue made a God. As for the interpreters of the true faith, they proclaim that the Word of God, who is elevated above every creature and perfect in all, who became incarnate and made man without change, is one Christ, without scission or division, and one person, one hypostasis and one unique nature of the incarnate Word, without saying that it is thanks to virtue that he became perfect. Repudiate this blasphemy! For in what should he have been rendered perfect, he who is essentially justice, wisdom, and holiness and, himself, communicates to every created and reasonable nature the participation in all these perfections, and is the source of all goods and the dispenser of virtue? But because he became incarnate in a flesh naturally apt to grow in size and to strengthen — he was indeed subject to suffering like us and consubstantial with us, for it is written that, with the exception of sin<sup><a href="#fn253" id="ref253">253</a></sup>, he was like us in all things, us for whom, being God, he made himself man — that is why they say concerning him that he strengthened in the flesh, that he grew and that the size of the body developed, with nourishment and the evolution of time advancing, to the state of perfect man, that he suffered and died for our sins in a passible and mortal flesh, that he resurrected from the dead to destroy by this the power of death<sup><a href="#fn254" id="ref254">254</a></sup> and to trace the road by the resurrection, immortality, and incorruptibility, all things for which he became first-fruits for us, for whose intention he accomplished everything. He humbled himself, as it is written<sup><a href="#fn255" id="ref255">255</a></sup>, so as to reduce himself to the conditions that are ours, with the exception of all sin, and not to recuse those for which he made himself man. It is therefore not an opprobrium for him that it is thanks to his flesh, which is consubstantial with us, that he descended to us, that he subsisted among us in our measures, and that he proposed conditions proper to his order as advantages that were to come to us. How therefore is it not entirely foolish to speak of baseness, or even of progress or perfection of virtue, concerning the order of our salvation and our healing, by virtue of which he who is perfect in all things lowered himself, and for this reason became incarnate, excluding sin, in a flesh suffering like ours and consubstantial with ours?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">One also immediately sees what separates the opinions of our venerable Fathers from the madness of the heretics, when one simply confronts the statements of the two parties. Indeed, the wretched Theodoret, intoxicated by the cup (drawn) from the vine of Judaism, in the Critique of the tenth chapter of Saint Cyril — where he divided the one Christ into two, into the God Word who is perfect in his integral nature and into the man issued from the seed of David who, as he says, was being perfected in virtue — poses this blasphemous question: [THEODORET] "Who then is he who became perfect through virtuous works and is not perfect in his nature? Who is he who learned obedience in the trial", whereas he was ignorant of it before the trial?"<sup><a href="#fn256" id="ref256">256</a></sup>. And after having said in the interval other words, he gives himself an answer to the blasphemous question, as if there had been two Christs: he who became perfect through virtuous works, this is not the God Word, the Immortal, the Impassible, the Incorporeal, but it is that which was assumed by him from the seed of David<sup><a href="#fn257" id="ref257">257</a></sup>. And after having thus 'decapitated' that which is issued from David and spoken of it in the neuter — that is to say, neither masculine nor feminine — continuing, in the same critique, he names it in the masculine and confesses that it is thanks to virtuous works that he appeared free from sin and that he was rendered worthy of being for us a high priest, saying: [THEODORET] "He who is issued from the seed of David, who is free from all sin, became our high priest and our victim"<sup><a href="#fn258" id="ref258">258</a></sup>. The Sage, taking up the defense against this critique and destroying this Jewish insanity, writes thus: [CYRIL] "Does what is human trouble you? And what befits God does not free you from fears? Do you not consent to see by the facts themselves that Emmanuel is both God and man, but, with impudence and hardness, rather surpassing all impiety, you say that it is by works that he became perfect in virtue and that it is progressively that he was elevated to the dignity of high priest? If he was elevated by virtue, how did he humble himself and reduce himself to poverty? If he became perfect in virtue, it is clear that it is from imperfection (that he was) and with time that he became perfect. Now everything that is imperfect in virtue falls under the qualification of culpability; on the other hand, that which is affected by culpability is subject to sin. How then is it written concerning him that he did not commit sin? <sup><a href="#fn259" id="ref259">259</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn260" id="ref260">260</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">And in what was written To the faithful queens, he shows two things: that it is not permitted to speak of progress in virtue and wisdom concerning Christ and that, while the body grew in size following the progression of time, he manifested his divinity in conformity with the economy and the proprieties, so that this progressive manifestation was considered as an increase of wisdom: [CYRIL] "In saying that our Lord Jesus Christ is one, and in attributing to him the human characteristics and those that befit God, we affirm that it truly befits the measures of the stripping to receive bodily increase, to be strengthened also, as the members of the body develop progressively, and even to appear full of wisdom, by the fact that to a progressive increase of stature befitting the body he made correspond a progressive manifestation of the wisdom which is in him<sup><a href="#fn261" id="ref261">261</a></sup>. These traits rightly befit the economy linked to the flesh and the measure of the lowering. It befits, on the other hand, the nature of the Word to be always perfect and to be Wisdom. It is therefore to him that belongs, according to humanity, the lowering to the state of stripping, and to him also likewise, according to divinity, what befits God. The modality of the economy realizes in the flesh the recognition of him as being like us and above us: surpassing the measure of creatures, as God, even if he is considered, from the fact that he became man, as stripped of what he was"<sup><a href="#fn262" id="ref262">262</a></sup>. He said similar things in what he composed Against the impious Diodore: [CYRIL] "For just as, while he suffered in his flesh, he remained impassible in the nature of his divinity, in the same manner also, I say, while he grew, he was perfect in all, and while he was considered as growing in wisdom, he was himself the total Wisdom by which those who are capable of wisdom are rendered wise"<sup><a href="#fn263" id="ref263">263</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">And John, who illustrated the pontifical seat of Constantinople, commenting in the eighth homily on the divine evangelist Matthew, taught the same things: [CHRYSOSTOM] "Herod seeking the life of the child, he had to flee and go away, according to humanity, for it was not fitting at that moment that he perform miracles. If indeed, from the first age, he had manifested miracles, he would not have been considered as being man. It is for this very reason that the temple was not formed in just any manner, but that there was also the conception, the time of nine months and of pains, of childbirth and of nursing and, during all this time, silence: he awaits a development of the body such that in all points the mystery of the economy becomes acceptable"<sup><a href="#fn264" id="ref264">264</a></sup>. Similarly also in the Discourse: 'Father, if it is possible that this cup pass from me'<sup><a href="#fn265" id="ref265">265</a></sup>: [CHRYSOSTOM] "For he did not arrive immediately at the (state of) complete and perfect man, but in the virginal womb, so as to submit to conception, to birth, to nursing and to progress over time, to change in size, to confirm by this everything that was happening"<sup><a href="#fn266" id="ref266">266</a></sup>. And Atticus, who took possession of his seat with faith in the truth, in the Discourse on the generation of Christ according to the flesh, speaks as follows: [ATTICUS] "The Word of mercy humbles himself, whereas according to his nature he ignores humiliation; indeed, 'he humbled himself by taking the likeness of a slave'<sup><a href="#fn267" id="ref267">267</a></sup>. He who is devoid of flesh becomes incarnate for you, for 'the Word became flesh'<sup><a href="#fn268" id="ref268">268</a></sup>. He who falls not under touch, because of the incorporeal character of his nature, is palpated. He who is without beginning was submitted to the beginning of a body. He who is perfect developed, He who is immutable grew"<sup><a href="#fn269" id="ref269">269</a></sup>. And Proclus, who occupied his seat in a manner worthy of a priest, resorts to the same healthy teachings when he writes To the bishops of the East of that time the following: [PROCLUS] "And he becomes incarnate without change he who is without figure, he is born according to the flesh he who is without beginning. He grows in bodily size he who according to his nature is perfect in all. He endures sufferings he who is above sufferings, by not undergoing the opprobrium in what he was, but by assuming the bodily sufferings in what he became"<sup><a href="#fn270" id="ref270">270</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">How then can one show that these eminent doctors are in agreement with those who divide the one Christ into a duality of natures after the union and introduce a man who, from a deficient state of virtue, arrived at perfection through works of renunciation and, as lacking virtue, fell under the mark of sin? For the fact of becoming incarnate in a flesh naturally apt to be hungry, to be thirsty and to die is not a lack of virtue subject to the contagion that results from sin: indeed everyone confesses that these sufferings are irreprehensible. Just as no one brings against him the accusation of imperfection by saying: "Why did he become a small child in a flesh and did he not become immediately a perfect man, such as he had formed Adam from the beginning?", so no one can rightly and knowingly reproach him: "Why did he undergo in a mortal flesh the trial of death?", since it is by dying truly and according to humanity that he willed, in conformity with justice, to abolish the debt of men and, by the resurrection, to inaugurate for those for whom he died immortality and incorruptibility. For it was necessary that the physician pass through all the infirmities with which we had been afflicted. Why then do you, do you incriminate that he took our state of deficiency, he who in all things was like us except for sin<sup><a href="#fn271" id="ref271">271</a></sup> and who leads in his own person to (their) completion these conditions which are ours by rectifying them according to an order that befits him? For it truly befitted the head of the body of the Church<sup><a href="#fn272" id="ref272">272</a></sup> to set himself as the head of all: thus Paul, the herald initiated into the precision of the divine teachings, said in writing to the Hebrews that it is through sufferings that he was made perfect as the initiator of our salvation<sup><a href="#fn273" id="ref273">273</a></sup>. Indeed, since the completion of the economy realized for us and of our healing was that Christ suffered in the flesh — for to the sufferings succeeded the resurrection, incorruptibility and immortality, which elevate us to our perfection and our first order as well as to the grace of the blessed life of paradise — the Word of God made man who, in that he is God, is essentially perfect in all, is rightly said to have been made perfect in that he became man, because he made his own the conditions which are ours and he became for us the first-fruits of (our) completion (leading) to incorruptibility and immortality, and that at the same time he gave an illustrious model to those who believe in him so that, in the combat for the faith, they tend through sufferings to perfection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Now this is what the very precise word of the most wise Cyril confirms again, addressed To the faithful queens in these terms: [CYRIL] "For indeed, as we were to know tribulation in the world, to be persecuted by enemies, to fight for the doctrine of the faith and, with labors and sweat, to practice virtue with firmness, he did not tolerate that we be depressed by fear; he shows us rather emboldened by the fact that he passed through sufferings, saying to persuade us also: 'The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. It is enough for the disciple to be like his master and for the servant to be like his lord'<sup><a href="#fn274" id="ref274">274</a></sup>. 'If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you'<sup><a href="#fn275" id="ref275">275</a></sup>. The Only-Begotten therefore intended to suffer for us in his own flesh; the divine Paul teaches us the reason when he says: 'For since the children have partaken of blood and flesh, he also likewise shared in them, that through death he might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage'<sup><a href="#fn276" id="ref276">276</a></sup>. From then on, as it was impossible that the nature of man destroy death — for it was in the power of it, the ancient curse having reduced it to this state — necessarily the God Word, who is life-giving, took on a nature which was in the power of death, that is, ours or that of the humanity which is ours, so that death which, like some wild animal, had attacked his flesh, renouncing, destroyed as it was by God, the tyranny that it exercised over us. It is therefore he who, perfected for us in the flesh according to humanity, perfects us according to divinity, by destroying the power of death. Indeed, incorruptibility came to be lacking to the nature of man who, at the beginning, had been in that state. For 'God did not make death, nor does he take pleasure in the destruction of the living. For he created all things that they might exist, and the creatures of the world are wholesome. There is no destructive poison in them, nor is there a kingdom of Hades on earth'<sup><a href="#fn277" id="ref277">277</a></sup>. But 'through the devil's envy death entered the world'<sup><a href="#fn278" id="ref278">278</a></sup>. Having therefore accomplished things in this manner, he says to God the Father who is in heaven: 'I have glorified you on the earth, by accomplishing the work that you gave me to do'<sup><a href="#fn279" id="ref279">279</a></sup>. Indeed, it is the true glory of God the Father to destroy death by his offspring. Also for him perfection is realized through sufferings, for us what happened constitutes the complement of our deficiency. For 'what is in Christ is a new creation'<sup><a href="#fn280" id="ref280">280</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn281" id="ref281">281</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">But let no one, hearing this, sink into this vain conception and say inappropriately and quite foolishly that it was before the cross and the resurrection that Christ had said to God his Father: "I have glorified you on the earth by accomplishing the work that you gave me to do"<sup><a href="#fn282" id="ref282">282</a></sup>! And let him not imagine to say: "Thus then from the moment of the incarnation of the Word, death was destroyed and the accomplishment of our redemption was achieved; from the beginning the assumed flesh was incorruptible by the fact that, impassible and immortal, it was not subject to the irreprehensible passions." Let him who is thus disposed know, indeed, that our Savior — when he came voluntarily to suffer for us and when, as God, he knew that he would be truly crucified and that he would resurrect, that he would thereby destroy the power of death, by becoming for us the way and the access to incorruptibility and immortality and by inaugurating (thus) our state of perfection — was proclaiming and declaring it in advance to the Father, when he designated the future as if it were already an accomplished thing: "I have glorified you on the earth, by accomplishing the work that you gave me to do"<sup><a href="#fn283" id="ref283">283</a></sup>. Indeed, to him who is God by nature all is easy and the things to come are present. And for him who made himself man for this very purpose of dying for us in the flesh and of destroying the death that weighed upon us and of which we were the captives, and who had (thus) laid for us a foundation and a principle, I mean the very fact of the incarnation, henceforth all the motives for which he had willed to become man were to follow; already they were present and accomplished: the cross, death, the resurrection, immortality, incorruptibility and the conversion of the entire world to piety, which he was to realize by being with the apostles and by acting in them through words and through acts: for it is thus that effects habitually flow from principles!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">And that these not be our conceptions, but indeed the meaning of the message inspired to the doctors, John, bishop of Constantinople, shows clearly, when, in the eightieth discourse of the Commentary, he explains this word by saying: [CHRYSOSTOM] "'The work that you gave me to do, I have accomplished'<sup><a href="#fn284" id="ref284">284</a></sup>, although it was still only the beginning of the enterprise, understand: not even the beginning! How then does he say: I have accomplished? Either: I have done all that fell to me; or because he speaks of the future as of a thing past; or, — and this is what must be said in preference to all else — that all was henceforth realized from the fact that he had laid the principle of the advantages, that the effects were indeed to follow necessarily and that he would be (himself) present and cooperating equally in what was to happen subsequently"<sup><a href="#fn285" id="ref285">285</a></sup>. Now that it is to die for us and to resurrect that the Word of God partook of birth in a flesh, that he gave death as the cause of his incarnation and that this marked the completion of our redemption, Gregory, the wise theologian, bishop of Nyssa, attested in the Catechetical Discourse, by writing the following: [GREGORY] "What then do we say to this again? That the birth rendered death necessary. For it was necessary, once he had willed to partake of humanity, that he pass through all the characteristics of the nature. If therefore human life is situated between two issues and that after passing through one, he had not reached the other, his will would have been half accomplished for not having reached the other characteristic of our nature. And he who would consider with precision the mystery, would say with assurance that it is not because of the birth that death occurred, but the reverse, that is to say that it is for the sake of death that the birth was assumed"<sup><a href="#fn286" id="ref286">286</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Why then would we pretend to show that the redemptive death is superfluous, by saying that it is from the moment of the incarnation that the flesh of our Lord, our God and our Savior, Christ, is incorruptible, that is to say impassible and immortal — for concerning incorruptibility under the aspect of sin, the unanimous consent is beyond contestation? Now if it is from the beginning that the flesh had ceased to be subject to the (irreprehensible) sufferings and to death, how would the Impassible and the Immortal have died? Or how would we believe we are doing something sensible, by alleging, from the treatise of Saint Cyril, called 'Address to the Emperor Theodosius', what Your Piety has cited: [CYRIL] "Just as, therefore, by becoming (that) of the Word who gives life to all, the flesh was elevated by him above the power of death and corruption"<sup><a href="#fn287" id="ref287">287</a></sup>, and without waiting to learn from the same doctor, in the same treatise, when and how the flesh was elevated above the power of death, given that the thing had been possible by the union to the life-giving Word who, through the intermediary of his very flesh — because it is subject to death — had entered into struggle with death and had also resurrected after having passed through death in conformity with the law and the nature of the flesh? For a mortal flesh can die in conformity with the law and the nature of the flesh, but not that which is incorruptible and immortal. Indeed, that which is incorruptible and immortal escapes the law of the corruptible and mortal nature, although it did not depart from being essentially a flesh. Let us therefore listen to the Doctor giving us this same teaching: [CYRIL] "What then shall we say? That he is mortal and can become the prey of corruption, the Word issued from God the Father? Or that he is, as Life, beyond the grasp of death and above corruption? And how is it not a thing known to each that he is, as Life, above death? And then, how was he, according to what is written, 'among the dead and free'?<sup><a href="#fn288" id="ref288">288</a></sup> He who died, it is not the Word himself taken apart by himself. We say therefore that his flesh having died, he himself is said to have undergone it. From then on it is not outside the flesh, but rather in it and with it that he put on the glory proper to the Lord, he who died in conformity with the law of the flesh and our nature, and who resurrected. If dying is a human suffering, he, by resurrecting, revealed a divine operation, so that he might be recognized under both aspects, as us, and above us as God, and that it might appear that he had become the Lord of all, he who even before (taking) a flesh exercised kingship with his Father"<sup><a href="#fn289" id="ref289">289</a></sup>. But he who died in conformity with the law of the flesh and our nature, resurrected above the law of nature, by breaking, after his descent into hell, the bonds of death, and by not submitting to the corruption and decomposition of the tomb. Thus therefore death and the sufferings occurred following the law of nature, the Word willing and permitting it; as for the resurrection and the other prodigies, it is above the laws of nature that they were realized.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, the doctor who said of Emmanuel that he died in conformity with the law of the flesh and our nature, taught us that he, the same, resurrected, and (that) above the law of nature and that he did not undergo corruption in the sepulcher, when, in the twelfth book of the Commentary on the Gospel of John, he writes in this manner: [CYRIL] "For it was necessary, yes, necessary to believe both that he died and that he was buried: it results indeed that we truly believe that, breaking the bonds of death, he was raised, as God, to the life that is proper to him. For it was not possible that he be in the power of death: being life according to his nature, how would he have undergone corruption? And he 'in whom we live, we move and we are'<sup><a href="#fn290" id="ref290">290</a></sup>, how would he have obeyed the law of nature and would he not rather, as God, have easily given life to that which was deprived of life?"<sup><a href="#fn291" id="ref291">291</a></sup>. Have we not clearly learned by this also what we had said in our prior examination<sup><a href="#fn292" id="ref292">292</a></sup>, that "not to be seized by death and corruption" means not to have remained in it, (implying) a complete detention, and not that he in no way underwent the trial of death and corruption. After having said indeed: "For it was necessary, yes, necessary to believe both that he died and that he resurrected", he added: "for it was not possible that he be in the power of death" and "as God, he gave life to that which was deprived of life". Now that which was truly deprived of life, it is the body which was dead and not the Immortal and the Incorruptible!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph">Consider on the other hand also, I beg you, the degree and the quality of the precision of orthodoxy which does not tolerate that violence and division were exercised upon Emmanuel. He said indeed that "breaking the bonds of death, he was raised, as God, to the life that is proper to him", because the Impassible was hypostatically united, without scission, to a body which was naturally apt to be subjected to the bonds of death. In the Letter to the monks also he writes as follows: [CYRIL] "How then did he become the first-born of the dead<sup><a href="#fn293" id="ref293">293</a></sup> and the first-fruits of those who have fallen asleep<sup><a href="#fn294" id="ref294">294</a></sup>? It is because he made his own a flesh subject to death; 'by the grace of God, as the most wise Paul said, he tasted for every man death in a flesh'<sup><a href="#fn295" id="ref295">295</a></sup> which was capable of receiving it, without abandoning himself to be life. Also, although he is said to have suffered in the flesh, because the Word became flesh<sup><a href="#fn296" id="ref296">296</a></sup>, the suffering was proper to the Impassible, who suffered in his own flesh subject to sufferings"<sup><a href="#fn297" id="ref297">297</a></sup>. Behold, here clearly again he did not limit himself to saying that "the God Word made his own a flesh subject to death", so that we would be authorized to explain it at our will by saying: the flesh was issued from a nature subject to death and from the mortal and human race, but it ceased, by the union to the Word, to be mortal and subject to death. He indeed added: "he indeed tasted for every man death in a flesh capable of dying", and again: "the suffering was proper to the impassible who suffered in his own flesh subject to sufferings". And similarly in what he wrote To the queens, he said: [CYRIL] "As we are therefore baptized in the name of the Father, so also are we baptized in the name of the Son as well as in his death and in the Holy Spirit. Let them therefore teach us, those who divide the one Christ and Son into two sons and who speak, in dividing the natures, of a man joined to God by the sole bond of honor and authority, in whose death we are baptized! If it is in that of the God Word taken in isolation, we attribute corruption to the immortal nature and we assign death to life by nature; if they say on the other hand that it is in the death of him who is issued from the woman, conceived in isolation, apart and separately as Son, how do they not declare in clear terms this: In any case it would truly be that very one who is placed in the same rank as the Father and the Spirit, but who, Word issued from God, would perhaps have been deprived of true filiation, if it is true that he in whose name we are baptized is subject to death? But assuredly he who has a vigilant spirit perceives the inconvenience of (such) thoughts. It is therefore necessary to understand that, having become like us, the Word of God suffered voluntarily in the flesh. For we are thus baptized in his death, inasmuch as he is the only Son, impassible according to the nature of divinity, but passible according to the flesh. And that Christ restores us by (his) resurrection for a new life, how could one doubt it? He places us before him and before the Father, returned living from among the dead, according to what is written: 'We have died to sin and we live for righteousness'<sup><a href="#fn298" id="ref298">298</a></sup>. He who lends only a dull ear; truly perceives also in these words how the doctor clearly declares: if we say that it is in the death of the Word stripped, and not incarnate, that we were baptized, we properly assign corruption to the immortal nature and we assign death to Life by nature.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore death is proper to the body which is under the corruption; and since it is subject to death, the flesh finds itself also submitted to corruption: it is in it that the Word of God, when he became incarnate without change nor division, tasted death and corruption and, while suffering in his own flesh, he remained, as God who is impassible by nature, above suffering. He was not retained and he did not remain in death and in corruption thanks to the resurrection, because it was impossible that the principle of life be seized by them, he who had inaugurated for us immortality, incorruptibility and eternal life<sup><a href="#fn299" id="ref299">299</a></sup>, who came to undergo all our trials except the likeness of sin, to win in our favor according to the law a total victory and to implant in us his own advantages. Also he is equally anathema who does not declare, that after the time of the economy of the redemptive sufferings is incorruptible, impassible and immortal in all the flesh of our Lord, our God and our Savior Jesus Christ, meaning that same in which the Word of God Jesus became incarnate and made man. But because he is without division one from two, from the divinity and from the humanity, it is necessary that we examine in spirit what he was, — he was indeed God before the ages, — and what he became, — for he became man for us without change, — what is the language that befits the divinity and what on the other hand is adapted to the economy; what is the origin of our Savior according to the flesh, what are the sufferings and death, what is the resurrection, the reason for which each of these characteristics was assumed; what is he who healed us and withdrew us from the evils in which we previously found ourselves and what was the dispenser of the gratification, given that the Word of God came for us into this world, that it was not for himself, and that, without undergoing change, he became what we were, so that henceforth, as one among us, — although he finds himself in conditions that surpass us, that is to say that surpass all creature, — he became the principle of every good, whatever it is and which comes to us, by becoming a second Adam for the whole human race.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">That is why let us not read, scorning their integrity, the texts of the inspired writings and of the holy Fathers, their interpreters, who have commented on them competently, but let us approach the entire doctrine; and, examining the words, in no way inferior to those of the apostles, of Gregory the Wonderworker who says and teaches in a Chapter: [GREGORY] "He who declares the Christ subject to change or to alteration and does not confess him immutable in spirit and incorruptible in the flesh, as it is written that he be anathema"<sup><a href="#fn300" id="ref300">300</a></sup>; let us attach ourselves to his doctrine with docility, an entire modesty, with all our soul and with a pure heart, as it is written<sup><a href="#fn301" id="ref301">301</a></sup>, without authorizing ourselves to comment ourselves on the thought of the doctor<sup><a href="#fn302" id="ref302">302</a></sup>; let us rather listen to him specify and bring out the sense of these words. In the same work, indeed, he says that the Christ was not vanquished nor weakened by the sufferings, like an ordinary man, but that, being Word of God incarnate and made man, not in appearance, he not only assumed a flesh endowed with a soul and intelligent, but he also took its passible character and he suffered voluntarily, given that he had become not only consubstantial to us, but also man, that he suffers as we do, without difference, and that, with the sole exception of sin, he took the resemblance with us, as the other theophoric fathers have also said, as we have shown<sup><a href="#fn303" id="ref303">303</a></sup>. It is for that that he underwent the sufferings of the body and of the rational soul and that he manifested them clearly in his works. The language of the doctor presents itself as follows: [GREGORY] "How would one say that the body of Christ is deprived of soul and of spirit? For the trouble, the sadness and the affliction are the mark neither of a flesh deprived of soul, nor of a soul deprived of spirit, nor of the immutable divinity, nor of a simple appearance, nor yet an inferiority of human weakness; but the Word gave in him the proof of the sufferings which are ours, in taking the passibility, according to what is written: 'Himself took our weaknesses and he tasted our afflictions'<sup><a href="#fn304" id="ref304">304</a></sup>. Now the trouble, the sadness and the affliction are weaknesses of the soul, the fatigue, the sleep and the bodily mutilation are infirmities of the flesh."<sup><a href="#fn305" id="ref305">305</a></sup> Let him therefore say it, he who claims, in his audacity, to explain otherwise the words and the thought of the doctor: If from before the resurrection it had been incorruptible, that is to say impassible and immortal, the flesh endowed with soul and intelligence of our Lord, our God and our Savior the Christ, how would it have been the prey of trouble, of sadness and of affliction, which are irreprehensible sufferings and weaknesses of the soul, and how of the fatigue, of the sleep and of the bodily mutilation which are infirmities of the flesh? For, immortal and impassible, he would be subject neither to weaknesses nor to infirmities. Now if our Lord gave himself to manifestations of sufferings, while the flesh was not subject to them, — it is indeed written that he knew trouble, anguish<sup><a href="#fn306" id="ref306">306</a></sup>, that he was fatigued<sup><a href="#fn307" id="ref307">307</a></sup>, that he slept<sup><a href="#fn308" id="ref308">308</a></sup> and that he was crucified, — what one saw was only appearance and not truth, if it is true that the body, as incorruptible, that is to say impassible and immortal, had ceased to be naturally apt to suffer!</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But behold that again Gregory presents himself to the debate and that, by his words, he repels the calumny by saying, in the work On the Incarnation and on the Faith, that the corruption was destroyed in the sepulture of the body by the first-fruits of the resurrection, by virtue of which he inaugurated, the first, in our favor incorruptibility and immortality. He writes indeed this: [GREGORY] "... and that the death was destroyed so as to reign no more, that the corruption was annihilated in the sepulture of the body<sup><a href="#fn309" id="ref309">309</a></sup> and that were shown the first-fruits of the resurrection."<sup><a href="#fn310" id="ref310">310</a></sup> Now the same doctor, in the Exposition of the Faith by Parts, exposes this same thing that after the consummation of the economy and after Emmanuel took upon himself for us the sufferings, the passibility of the flesh was destroyed by the fact that it was seized by immortality and the immutable incorruptibility, which is the return and the recovery of the original beauty that humanity held when it inhabited paradise, so that henceforth those who believed, in appropriating the faith, received from him, as new first-fruits, the same advantage. He writes this: [GREGORY] "The divinity suppressed the possibility of the flesh by the consummation of the mystery. After the destruction of death, there was in the holy flesh a perpetual impassibility and an immutable immortality: the original beauty of humanity was recovered thanks to the power of the divinity, it was on the other hand accorded to all men by the fact that they appropriate the faith. If there are some who on this point also alter the divine faith or who attribute in proper to the divinity human characters, the growth, the sufferings or an adventitious glory, or who separate from the divinity the body which grew and suffered, as if it subsisted in isolation, they are, them also, outside of the salutary and ecclesiastical confession"<sup><a href="#fn311" id="ref311">311</a></sup> Will one therefore also range this apostolic man with those who divide into two natures our Lord? And will one incriminate him, like the impious, of considering the Christ as imperfect, because he declares that the glory and the immortality were added to the holy flesh after the resurrection and the destruction of death, so that he became the access and the way leading to our immortality, to our incorruptibility and to our glory, that we would acquire after death by the resurrection? But it is himself who expressed with precision, in the same work, these veridical and divine words: [GREGORY] "He is also true God, perfect of a divine and true perfection, not two persons nor two natures. We do not say either, indeed, that we will adore four, God, the Son of God, the man and the Holy Spirit. That is why we anathematize also those who commit this impiety of placing a man in the divine confession"<sup><a href="#fn312" id="ref312">312</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">It is necessary therefore that we read integrally the teachings of the venerable doctors who succeeded one another in the holy Church, that we do not allege partially what belongs to them and that we do not make dangerously of their thought entirely an object of suspicion. It is indeed what it is necessary to do also with the book of the apostles and of the evangelists and with every inspired book; for it is not with a single statement, a single letter or a single exposition that it is possible to present the religion entirely: sometimes we find the divine heralds applying themselves to the human measures of Christ, sometimes on the other hand remaining in the conditions that befit God and still superimposing wisely all together to what pertains to the state of humiliation and to the Economy the conditions from on high and those that befit God. And if it happens that someone extracts from it without examination a certain part and brings it, according to his opinion, in favor of another party, he enters into struggle with all the holy books and he is cornered to the truth because a unanimous consent emerges from the preaching of all. It is what has written also the great Athanasius, in an Apology for Denis, when the Arians, on the basis of a single one of his letters, applied themselves to say about him that he was an adept of their opinion: [ATHANASIUS] "It is from then on for them the occasion to say in paying with audacity, — for their audacity takes on everything! — that the apostles themselves share the ideas of Arius, since they declare the Christ a man of Nazareth and passible! Behold therefore to what point they delirium! Is it because they had recourse to similar statements that the apostles recognize in the Christ only a man solely and nothing more? Not at all! One could never conceive it, were it only in thought! But this also they did as wise architects and as stewards of the divine mysteries"<sup><a href="#fn313" id="ref313">313</a></sup>, with a legitimate reason to act in such a manner. As the Jews were then in error and inducing in error the pagans, that they thought that the Christ is an ordinary man, come only from the seed of David like the other sons issued from David, — for they believed neither that he was God nor that the Word became flesh, — for that reason, with much appropriateness the blessed apostles began by revealing to the Jews the human characters of our Savior so that, after having persuaded them of the coming of the Messiah by visible signs and which had occurred, they bring them from then on also to the faith in the divinity, in showing that the works produced are not those of a man but of a God. Thus Peter, after having said the Christ a passible man, has immediately added himself that he was the initiator of the life<sup><a href="#fn314" id="ref314">314</a></sup>. In the gospel he had confessed: 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!'<sup><a href="#fn315" id="ref315">315</a></sup>, in an epistle on the other hand he declared that he was the guardian of our souls<sup><a href="#fn316" id="ref316">316</a></sup>, his Lord<sup><a href="#fn317" id="ref317">317</a></sup> and that of the angels and of the powers<sup><a href="#fn318" id="ref318">318</a></sup>. Of his side Paul also, who had said of the Son that he was man, issued from the seed of David<sup><a href="#fn319" id="ref319">319</a></sup>, wrote on the one hand in such a manner to the Hebrews: 'who is the radiance of his glory and the imprint of his substance'<sup><a href="#fn320" id="ref320">320</a></sup>, and, on the other hand to the Philippians: 'He who is in the form of God did not esteem a prey to be the equal of God'<sup><a href="#fn321" id="ref321">321</a></sup>. Now to speak of initiator of the life, of Son of God, of radiance, of imprint and of equal of God, of Lord and of guardian of the souls, what does that mean other than: the Word of God, by whom all has been made, was in a body and he was not separated from the Father, as behaves the radiance in relation to the light<sup><a href="#fn322" id="ref322">322</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And saint John, bishop of Constantinople, in the twenty-seventh discourse of the Commentary on the Gospel of John, writes in these terms of similar ideas: [CHRYSOSTOM] "Indeed, it is because he said: 'We know that you have come from God as a teacher'<sup><a href="#fn323" id="ref323">323</a></sup>, that he rectifies this expression as if he said: Do not think about me that I am teacher in the same manner as the multitude of the prophets who are from the earth. For now I have come from heaven and among the prophets no one has ascended to heaven; but I dwell there! See: even what seems the most elevated is quite vile and unworthy of his grandeur. For he is not in heaven only, but everywhere and he fills all of himself. But again he speaks with regard to the weakness of the listener, with the intention of elevating him progressively. Now here it is not the flesh that he calls Son of Man<sup><a href="#fn324" id="ref324">324</a></sup>, but now it is a name drawn from the vile nature that he gave to himself entirely, so to speak. Such is indeed his habit, to give frequently to the whole a name drawn from the divinity and frequently also a name drawn from the humanity"<sup><a href="#fn325" id="ref325">325</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In the same manner the very wise Cyril, in the treatise Christ is One, says of the apostle that there are cases where he wrote concerning Emmanuel as about a God only and not as if he were equally become man for us: [CYRIL] "While knowing that he became flesh, Paul dares therefore, when it happens to him to contemplate him in the heights of the divinity, not to declare in every place that he is man. He wrote therefore to the Galatians: 'Paul, apostle, not from men nor by intermediary of man, but by Jesus-Christ'<sup><a href="#fn326" id="ref326">326</a></sup>, and in another place still: 'I make you know that the Gospel that I have preached does not come from a man; indeed, it is not from a man either that I have received it or learned it, but by revelation of Jesus-Christ'<sup><a href="#fn327" id="ref327">327</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn328" id="ref328">328</a></sup>. And again in the Discourse to the pious emperor Theodosius: [CYRIL] "The divine Scriptures also proclaim him sometimes as being entirely man, in passing under silence the divinity conforming to the economy, sometimes on the other hand as God also, in passing under silence the humanity. But in no manner does he suffer prejudice from it, because of the conjunction of the two in a unity"<sup><a href="#fn329" id="ref329">329</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore when the inspired Scripture and the holy Fathers, who have interpreted it without altering it, declare that our Lord Jesus-Christ is constituted without division from two, from the divinity and from the humanity which, each, are perfect in their kind, and that sometimes they speak solely as if it were about the God, that sometimes it happens that they give to the whole a name as if it were drawn from the humanity and that they express themselves as if it were about a man, in passing his divinity under silence, it is necessary in no manner that we seize a single word of what they have said and that, thanks to it, we establish what pleases us, in separating it from other words which permit to recognize the integral spirit of the religion. It is thus that it was not necessary either that your Holiness, in the examination of the discussion submitted to the debate, with the intention of establishing that the flesh of our Savior the Christ is, from before the resurrection, incorruptible, that is to say impassible and immortal, brought and cited a text of saint Cyril, which is found in the third book Against the Blasphemies of Nestorius and which illuminates the manner in which the blessed Paul said, in writing to the Corinthians: [CYRIL] "And as we have put on the form of the terrestrial, we will put on the form of the celestial"<sup><a href="#fn330" id="ref330">330</a></sup>, saying form of the terrestrial that of our father Adam, and of the celestial that of the Christ. What is therefore the form of our father Adam? The facility of the tendency to sin, the fact of becoming the prey of death and of corruption. And what is that of the celestial? Not to be submitted in any manner to the sufferings, to ignore injustice, not to be the prey neither of death nor of corruption, to be the Holiness, the Justice and all that which is apparent and close to them"<sup><a href="#fn331" id="ref331">331</a></sup>. And after having alleged and cited the text until here, you believed that it sufficed for you to demonstrate that the flesh of our Savior the Christ is incorruptible, impassible and immortal from before the resurrection, because the doctor had said that it was not submitted to death and to corruption! It was necessary however to add and cite what is annexed to the text, by virtue of which it appears clearly that he speaks here of the Christ as God only, who, according to the divine nature, is immortal and impassible, and that it is not as he has an impassible and immortal flesh, in which he experienced sufferings for us and truly died, while remaining above death and sufferings by the fact that he is God. He has indeed opportunely added to his words and said: [CYRIL] "But I think that these traits befit to be the possession of the divine and immortal nature. For it is above sin and corruption and it is holiness and justice. In all that the Word issued from God the Father elevates us also, in rendering us participants of the divine nature<sup><a href="#fn332" id="ref332">332</a></sup> by the Holy Spirit"<sup><a href="#fn333" id="ref333">333</a></sup>. Behold that he restricts the scope of the statement to the divine and immortal nature, that is to say to that of the Word, in passing under silence the flesh, and that, although it is, it also, holy and above the corruption of sin.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">It was necessary on the other hand, with these words, to allege also those that one finds in the book and which show with what wisdom the Doctor, at grips with the miserable Nestorius, has brought out, in the exposition of the orthodoxy, the traits that appear in the unique Christ, who is without division, and how he says that he is, on the one hand, perfect in all and without any deficiency in relation to the order of virtue, as these impious wish, — indeed, from his childhood he rejected the evil and ignored sin<sup><a href="#fn334" id="ref334">334</a></sup>, — and that, on the other hand, in the terrestrial body, consubstantial to us and naturally apt to suffer, he suffered, died and resurrected from among the dead, so that one believed with good right that he had been the first-born<sup><a href="#fn335" id="ref335">335</a></sup> and the first-fruits<sup><a href="#fn336" id="ref336">336</a></sup> of our resurrection. He expressed himself as follows: [CYRIL] "How therefore, tell me, was he elevated to the supreme priesthood? In being rendered perfect in virtue? How and from where would someone doubt that what is equal to what is perfect in virtue, is under the blow of culpability, is not in all worthy of admiration, that it bears perhaps even the mark of sin? But it is assuredly true that he did not commit sin and that one has not found ruse in his mouth, as it is written<sup><a href="#fn337" id="ref337">337</a></sup>. He is therefore quite perfect he who is such in all things and he has in no manner deficiency in relation to him who behaves perfectly in the accomplishment of his virtuous work. And when was he imperfect in the good, he who in the very womb is God? He of whom the prophet Isaiah has said also: 'He will eat cream and honey; before that he knows or discerns the evil, he will choose the good, because before that the child knows the good or the evil, he rejects the evil to choose the good'<sup><a href="#fn338" id="ref338">338</a></sup>. How therefore is it possible for you to demonstrate still the imperfection of the Christ in the good? Or of what progress had he need, he who was perfect to the point of rejecting all evil, of preferring to it the good and of choosing only him solely?"<sup><a href="#fn339" id="ref339">339</a></sup> And after having sufficiently taught by that, from the divine Scriptures, that he had been without sin from his very childhood and that he had need of no progress to attain virtue, he who is submitted to none of the passions relevant to evil and sin and who, as God, is solely good, he adds also how he suffered and died for us in a flesh, he who could suffer and undergo death: it is that it was impossible that God, impassible and immortal, undergo the passions and death in another manner than in uniting himself to what is naturally apt to suffer, to that that a true death be accomplished in it so that a true resurrection be produced. For we had need also of a true death and of a true resurrection, we who were truly dead and fallen and who had need to straighten ourselves. It is as first-fruits that will follow him truly also those for whom he became the first.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Now, at this place, he adds and alleges also this: [CYRIL] "It results from everywhere that the Word of God is impassible; and that he suffered for us in the flesh, the voice of the theologians sanctions the truth. Now if you tear the Word of God from the terrestrial body, all for you is reduced to nothing! Indeed, if he did not become man, he did not die either for us, and if he did not deliver his body to death, how does one say that he became the first-born of the dead?<sup><a href="#fn340" id="ref340">340</a></sup> From then on the Christ did not die and he did not resurrect! That the divine Paul intervene therefore for us in the debate and that he declare well loud: 'If the dead do not resurrect, the Christ also is not resurrected!'<sup><a href="#fn341" id="ref341">341</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn342" id="ref342">342</a></sup> And again in the fifth book: [CYRIL] "Thus therefore, although he is said to have suffered, we recognize him impassible as God, but we say that he underwent in his flesh, conforming to the economy, the death, so that, in trampling it and in resurrecting, by that very that he is naturally life and vivifying, he restored to incorruptibility what death dominated, that is to say the body, and that in such a manner the efficacy of his work led to good came until us, extending to our entire race"<sup><a href="#fn343" id="ref343">343</a></sup>. And again a little further: [CYRIL] "Now work achieved, it is we who are, in that, in him the first, we vanquish the corruption and we trample the power of death; for he returned to life and rose from among the dead, while we were all in him"<sup><a href="#fn344" id="ref344">344</a></sup> It is easy to understand clearly by that also that the Doctor, in proper terms, declared God impassible, who is life, the Word vivifying who underwent death in his own flesh, conforming to the economy; that in resurrecting from among the dead, he restored to incorruptibility what death dominated, that is to say the body in which he had undergone death. And the reason itself, he signals it immediately it was to succor us, we for whom it was necessary to carry off a true victory over death, which was destroyed and vanquished by the resurrection. Now there would not have been a true resurrection if a true death had not preceded it. But the death is true, since Emmanuel died for us, as it is written, in a body that death dominated, and he returned to life and resurrected from among the dead, while we were all in him, in restoring to incorruptibility the body that death dominated; by the very fact he destroyed the power of the tyranny, so that in such a manner came until us also the efficacy of his work led to good, in extending to our entire race.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">It is therefore very clearly demonstrated by all that that all that was realized in the resurrection of our God and Savior the Christ constitutes the way, the image and the order of our resurrection, of our impassibility, of our immortality and of our incorruptibility. For we also we begin by dying and then we revive and, at the resurrection, this corruptible body will put on incorruptibility and this mortal body will put on immortality<sup><a href="#fn345" id="ref345">345</a></sup>. How therefore can we still say what is indemonstrable, impossible, unrealizable, contrary to the entire intention of the economy and in conflict even with the inspired Scripture and with those who have explained it with such competence, to know that the body of our God and Savior, Christ, would have been, from the instant of the incarnation, incorruptible and thereby impassible and immortal and that, consequently, by the resurrection only, it would have appeared that it was incorruptible and immortal? For here is the very wise Cyril who, with all the testimonies of the doctors we have previously adduced, openly proclaims, by this very word that we have cited a little earlier, that Emmanuel, in resurrecting from among the dead, restored to incorruptibility the body that death dominated so that in this way the efficacy of the work accomplished might reach us also, extending to our entire race<sup><a href="#fn346" id="ref346">346</a></sup>. Now if we say that it would have been improper for the body not to be incorruptible, that is to say impassible and immortal, from the moment of union to the Word of God the Father, we take it upon ourselves, so to speak, to censure the physician, we reproach his treatment for lacking wisdom, his plan for being devoid of consistency, his abasement for being weakness, the economy for being unreasonable; we imitate moreover the Jews who, ignorant of the goal and the end of the divine inhumanation, blame him for his voluntary death and consider as a weakness the very fact of waiting until, by the resurrection, he destroys the power of death and inaugurates immortality and incorruptibility for us, for whose intention he made himself man and for whom it was necessary that he become in all a way and an access: thus, shaking their impious heads and turning him into derision, they said: "If you are the Son of God, come down now from the cross!"<sup><a href="#fn347" id="ref347">347</a></sup> And one can hear the pagans declare at the top of their voices until this day: Could he not, if he is God and Almighty, redeem the human race from death by a command and a simple assent and order that it would henceforth be immortal, so that a God would not be constrained to undergo crucifixion and death and, in this way, to resurrect? Relying indeed on a human and demonic wisdom, which believes everything (accessible) to its mortal thoughts, does not possess the Spirit of God<sup><a href="#fn348" id="ref348">348</a></sup> and ignores the intention of the divine Scriptures, they have not learned, like Paul, to think and to say: "For since by a man came death, by a man also comes the resurrection of the dead; for as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive"<sup><a href="#fn349" id="ref349">349</a></sup>. For he willed, according to wisdom and justice, to renew the combat to (repair) our defeat and, passing through a human and true death, to destroy death by the resurrection that befitted a God. For it is for this also that, without undergoing change, he became man. For to have a God stripped and not incarnate intervene, who comes to grips with death and triumphs over it, would be ridiculous and would not escape the mark of folly, since he is superior to every creature, that he sustains all and that he holds by his nature victory over all.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But we must also scrutinize this other point, disentangle it carefully and bring to it a honest labor which is due to your venerable and pious old age. For I remember that you demanded from me an examination of what you had written; now it befits an examination to leave nothing that escapes criticism. For you have drafted a similar exposition with the intention of showing that the body of our Lord, our God and our Savior Christ is at once passible and impassible, that is to say incorruptible in the sufferings: [JULIAN] "Now we have on this subject examples which confirm more by experience than by reason these data which surpass understanding. If someone indeed believes that the bush, which is only a body, was burning and was not consumed<sup><a href="#fn350" id="ref350">350</a></sup>, while the fire itself was spreading with the matter, how does that one not believe that, while the passible body of our Lord suffered voluntarily for others, incorruptibility was always maintained in it? Thus will he not also believe that, while the bush was in flames, it enjoyed at the same time also incombustibility?"<sup><a href="#fn351" id="ref351">351</a></sup> It is good, here again, as a precaution, to repeat to your Piety what has been many times expressed: If you say that it is the incorruptibility that one recognizes in the absence of sin and holiness, which was always maintained in the flesh of our Lord, we are all in agreement, and he who contests it bears upon himself the mark of impiety; if on the contrary you claim to affirm that it is of an incorruptibility, understood as resulting from impassibility and immortality, that the flesh of our Lord was incorruptible, impassible and immortal in the sufferings and in death, it would have been necessary for you to say clearly that in the passible body of Our Lord, even when he suffered voluntarily for others, impassibility and immortality were always maintained; and not, under the name of incorruptibility, which one understands indifferently and which signifies sometimes the absence of sin and sometimes impassibility and immortality, leave the sense of what has been said in such obscurity that he who says, subsequently, that the flesh of Our Lord is not incorruptible before the resurrection is considered as a blasphemer because he thinks to attribute to the holy and sinless body the corruptibility of sin! However, as I have said previously<sup><a href="#fn352" id="ref352">352</a></sup>, it is not that which concerns what is proposed to our examination, everyone professing that never the corruption resulting from sin has reached the most holy body of our Lord. But here is what is being researched: when he underwent the irreprehensible sufferings, hunger, thirst and fatigue, blows, tortures and the cross, was he incorruptible, impassible and immortal? For the incorruptibility which is opposed to irreprehensible sufferings is impassibility and immortality: that to the passible are opposed impassibility and immortality, this is what already Saint John, bishop of Constantinople, said concerning our Savior Christ, in the texts which have been cited above<sup><a href="#fn353" id="ref353">353</a></sup>: When he resurrected from among the dead, he did not have a passible body, but henceforth immortal and impassible. Now, in writing clearly that in the passible body of our Lord, even when he suffered voluntarily for others, incorruptibility was always maintained<sup><a href="#fn354" id="ref354">354</a></sup>, as well as impassibility and immortality, your Piety declares that it was maintained to such a point, in the sufferings, that the same was at once passible and impassible and immortal! You have indeed added, in support of this, as to reprimand he who contests it: [JULIAN] "Thus will he not also believe that, while the bush was in flames, it enjoyed at the same time also incombustibility?"<sup><a href="#fn355" id="ref355">355</a></sup> Know therefore, O my dearest of all, that all those who have successively been the doctors of the mysteries in the holy Church, following as leader the prince of the apostles Peter, who writes that Christ certainly suffered for us in the flesh<sup><a href="#fn356" id="ref356">356</a></sup>, have unanimously taught that he is one and the same, from two perfect elements, from the divinity and from the humanity, and one unique person, one unique hypostasis and one unique incarnate nature, That of the God Word himself, Emmanuel who, in truth, is neither split nor divided and is, himself, impassible in his divinity and passible in the flesh. But that his flesh is at once passible and impassible, that is to say suffering and non-suffering, like the bush, as you have said, which was in flames and was not consumed, absolutely no one has thought this among those who have taught with competence. This will appear, when we shall have cited somewhat from their writings susceptible of confirming what has been said.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Athanasius therefore, the great mystagogue, in a work: On the faith against those who share the opinions of Apollinaris, writes this: [ATHANASIUS] "For it is thus that death also was produced: the body welcoming it conforming to its nature and the Word submitting to it voluntarily and delivering of his own free will his own body to death, so that it might suffer for us conforming to its nature and that it might resurrect for us conforming to the divinity. And the whole affair of the birth and death in him is envisaged in view of our research and our conversion"<sup><a href="#fn357" id="ref357">357</a></sup>. And further: [ATHANASIUS] "Thus therefore he is himself the one who suffered and the one who did not suffer: he is according to his divine nature immutable and inalterable, but in his flesh he suffered, as Peter has said<sup><a href="#fn358" id="ref358">358</a></sup>, and by his will he tasted death<sup><a href="#fn359" id="ref359">359</a></sup>, because he became the mediator between God and men<sup><a href="#fn360" id="ref360">360</a></sup>; now the mediator is not of one alone and God is alone<sup><a href="#fn361" id="ref361">361</a></sup>. They are therefore mistaken those who say that another is the one who suffered and another the one who did not suffer. For it is not someone else, outside of the Word, the one who assumed the sufferings and death, but the Word himself, impassible and incorporeal, in assuming the birth of human flesh, has accomplished all so that he might have something to offer"<sup><a href="#fn362" id="ref362">362</a></sup>. How therefore would we bring something which is not adapted and in affinity with the suffering that Christ our God suffered in the flesh, — as you have brought the example of the bush, — whereas the doctor proclaims clearly that it is conforming to its nature that the body welcomed death and that it is naturally that it suffered, because the God Word himself had willed it and that of his own free will, by his, he had become incarnate in order to suffer in the flesh, but that it is in a manner surpassing nature that the bush subsisted without being consumed nor suffering. It is henceforth impossible that we say the flesh at once passible and impassible in the sufferings. This is indeed opposed to the goal of the economy which wants that it be by death, which occurs naturally to a flesh naturally apt to die, that the death which held us be condemned thanks to the resurrection. For it is for this that the Word of God, immutable and immortal, became incarnate and made man so that he might be himself and truly suffering in a body which was naturally apt to suffer, impassible according to the divinity, dying also according to the humanity, but resurrecting by a divine operation and destroying death.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For it is thus that we have adduced Saint Cyril saying in the Discourse addressed to the pious emperor Theodosius: [CYRIL] "... He who died conforming to the law of the flesh and to our nature and who resurrected. If to die is a human suffering, he, in resurrecting, revealed a divine operation"<sup><a href="#fn363" id="ref363">363</a></sup>. And the same, in the Scholia has said this: [CYRIL] "He suffers and he does not suffer, according to the one and the other aspect: for he suffers according to the humanity, in the flesh, by the fact that he became man, but he is impassible as God"<sup><a href="#fn364" id="ref364">364</a></sup>. He writes the same thing To the pious queens: "For we are baptized in his death for as much as the Son is one, impassible according to the divine nature, but passible according to the flesh"<sup><a href="#fn365" id="ref365">365</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And Gregory the Theologian, bishop of Nazianzus, in the Letter to Cledonius, defines: [GREGORY] "... our Lord and our God, Jesus Christ, ... passible according to the flesh, impassible according to the divinity"<sup><a href="#fn366" id="ref366">366</a></sup>. And again, in the discourse On Baptism: [GREGORY] "Entirely man and, the same, equally God for he who had suffered entirely, to give to you entirely salvation, in destroying entirely the condemnation resulting from sin, impassible according to the divinity, passible according to what he assumed"<sup><a href="#fn367" id="ref367">367</a></sup>. In the same way Saint Epiphanius also, the bishop of Salamis, — which is Constantia situated in the island of Cyprus, — in an exposition Against the Heresies, dissertating on the Eunomians, writes as follows: [EPIPHANIUS] "Thus therefore being Wisdom and God impassible, knowing also that by the sufferings he would redeem those who were affected by the sufferings of death, he did not send before him either an ambassador, or an angel, nor yet prophets, but the Lord himself came and, after having taken what was passible, he truly suffered in it, while his divinity remained impassible"<sup><a href="#fn368" id="ref368">368</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore they all equally recognize, not the flesh at once passible and impassible in the sufferings, but he who is one sole Christ, impassible in the divinity and, the same, passible in the flesh which he assumes to suffer and die, and not in an (flesh) incorruptible, that is to say impassible and immortal, before the resurrection. This is what we are informed of also by Saint Cyril, who delivers to us in the passages previously examined the teaching that follows: [CYRIL] "... the power of death rushing upon the flesh alone from which it was also expelled. For if it is not his body which knew death that is resurrected, what death was vanquished? And how would the power of corruption have found itself without force, whereas none among the rational creatures died, neither soul, nor angel, to not speak of the God Word? When therefore the power of death made itself felt only on what is naturally apt to be corrupted, one understands with good right that it is on that also that the power of the resurrection is exercised, so that the force of the tyrant might also be destroyed"<sup><a href="#fn369" id="ref369">369</a></sup>. For if it was from the incarnation and the union to the God Word that the body had ceased to be naturally apt to be corrupted, that is to say to suffer and to die, and if it had been incorruptible, that is to say impassible and immortal, neither suffering nor death would have reached he who was not naturally apt to suffer and to die. Now if death was not authentic, the resurrection also finds itself in any case to be false. The Doctor has said indeed that it is "on what is naturally apt to be corrupted that the power of death made itself felt" and that "if it is not his body which knew death that is resurrected, what death was vanquished? And where would the power of corruption have found itself without force?". Here clearly it is the same power that he called (power) of death and of corruption and that it is after having made itself felt in what is naturally apt to be corrupted that it found itself without force thanks to the resurrection. For if it is in an immortal and impassible body that Emmanuel had willed to engage and deliver the combat for us, why was the incarnation required of he who by his nature, because he is God, possessed impassibility and immortality? But because he wanted to vanquish and destroy the devil, who held the power of it, by a death which is ours, he, for this motive, suffered and died in a body consubstantial to ours, suffering like ours and naturally apt to suffer and to die; and, like a victorious wrestler, after having voluntarily come to blows with the adversary and having been dominated by him, he resurrected by a force which befits God and destroyed the bonds of death, because it was impossible that the principle of life<sup><a href="#fn370" id="ref370">370</a></sup> and of the resurrection be retained and remain in death and corruption. For it is he who brought us from nothing to existence, since it is by him that all was made and that without him nothing was made<sup><a href="#fn371" id="ref371">371</a></sup>; and, whereas we had fallen into death and had lost the grace of immortality, he brought us back to it by the resurrection, in becoming for us the firstborn from among the dead<sup><a href="#fn372" id="ref372">372</a></sup> and the principle of incorruptibility and of the future life. It is for this that Isaiah called him also the father of the age to come<sup><a href="#fn373" id="ref373">373</a></sup>, whereas he is the author of all ages. For he was in the sufferings which are ours and irreprehensible, suffering voluntarily in the flesh, not to remain and be retained totally in the conditions which are ours, but so that, undergoing all in his own flesh which had been reached by each of our passions, he might bring the garrison to a flesh of the same race as that of all men and consubstantial to the flesh issued from Adam, he destroyed its weaknesses and affirmed its Energy in the combat for piety.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">This is what Gregory the Theologian, in the Apologetic Discourse, writes in this manner: [GREGORY] "It is for this that the wood (stands) against the wood, the hands against the hand: against that which was extended in a licentious manner, those which were extended with force; against that which is slack, those which are maintained by the nails; against that which expelled Adam, those which bring back the extremities (of the world) to their intimacy. This is why exaltation is opposed to the fall, the fasting to that which tastes (well) and death to death; darkness takes the place of light; the sepulcher is opposed to the return to dust and the resurrection takes the place of the resurrection; all this was for us divine pedagogy and treatment of our infirmities, to bring back the old Adam from where he had fallen"<sup><a href="#fn374" id="ref374">374</a></sup>. Now the doctor said "darkness takes the place of light" for the reason that follows: even when Emmanuel was buried with respect to the flesh, he had declared in advance by the intermediary of the prophet in a psalm: "They have deposited me dead"<sup><a href="#fn375" id="ref375">375</a></sup>; in this way, thanks to the descent into hell, the light surging in these dark places, he could say to the prisoners to come out and to those who were in darkness to go to the light, according to the word of Isaiah<sup><a href="#fn376" id="ref376">376</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The divine Athanasius: for his part knew that the infirmities of our flesh had been healed and suppressed by the fact that our Savior Christ had suffered in a passible body, whereas, impassible by the fact that he is God, he had remained above the sufferings. He writes indeed what follows in the Letter addressed to Aricetes: [ATHANASIUS] "And this was prodigious that he was, himself, the one who suffered and who did not suffer: for he suffered, because his body suffered and he was in that which suffered; on the other hand he did not suffer by the fact that the God Word is naturally impassible. The incorporeal himself was in a passible body. Moreover the body had in him the impassible Word, who destroyed the infirmities of the body which was his. For it is this that he operated and this was realized in this way so that, assuming himself the conditions which are ours and offering them in sacrifice, he destroyed them and that, subsequently, clothing us with his own, he made the apostle say: 'It is necessary that this (being) corruptible put on incorruptibility' and that this (being) mortal put on immortality<sup><a href="#fn377" id="ref377">377</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn378" id="ref378">378</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And Saint Cyril also, in the apology of the tenth of the chapters, where the anathemas are found, Against the criticisms of the impious Theodoret, writes what follows: [CYRIL] "He wept in a human manner to suppress your tears, he experienced fear conforming to the Economy, permitting sometimes that his flesh support what is proper to it, in order to render us magnanimous. He refused the cup so that the cross might accuse the impiety of the Jews. He is said to have been rendered without strength conforming to the humanity in order to make cease your own weakness. He addressed prayers and supplications in order to attract the audience of the Father to your own prayer<sup><a href="#fn379" id="ref379">379</a></sup>, so that you might learn, you, to not sleep in the temptations, but to watch in prayer<sup><a href="#fn380" id="ref380">380</a></sup>."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The venerable Fathers teach us therefore, from the inspired writings, that even if the sufferings and death of our God Savior were voluntary and that they healed our infirmities, they were however natural and proper to a passible flesh and truly suffering: the incarnate Word permitting that it suffer conforming to the law of nature, so that one might believe that, under the aspect of the flesh, he had himself suffered in his own flesh, while remaining impassible under the aspect of the divinity. Listen indeed to the great Athanasius speak in this manner: [ATHANASIUS] "And death was produced because the body was naturally subject to it, that on the other hand the Word submitted to it voluntarily and that he offered of his own free will his body to death, so that it might suffer for us conforming to nature and that it might resurrect for us according to the divinity"<sup><a href="#fn381" id="ref381">381</a></sup>. And Gregory the Theologian, in the Discourse on the Appearance of God, declares: [GREGORY] "... since he was fatigued, he was hungry and he was thirsty, he experienced fear and he wept conforming to the law of the body"<sup><a href="#fn382" id="ref382">382</a></sup>. And the very wise Cyril, in the fifth tome Against the blasphemies of Nestorius, writes the same thing in these terms: [CYRIL] "Thus therefore he delivered his body to the law of its nature and he assumed to taste death. And it is opportunely that the Word who was united to him permitted that he undergo it: he was resurrected by the divine force of the Word who was hypostatically united to him. It is therefore Emmanuel entirely, — which is interpreted: our God with us, — that we understand, when we hear the divine Peter declare: 'This Jesus, God has resurrected him'<sup><a href="#fn383" id="ref383">383</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn384" id="ref384">384</a></sup>. And again Basil, the interpreter of the divine teaching, who was minutely instructed in the royal way, in the Discourse on 'Give Thanks'<sup><a href="#fn385" id="ref385">385</a></sup>, writes what follows: [BASIL] "Our Lord therefore supported hunger, once the solid foods were dissolved, he admitted thirst, when the humor which was in the body came to be lacking, and he experienced lassitude, when the articulations and the nerves had failed by reason of the fatigue of the way, not that the divinity succumbed to fatigue, but the body undergoing the accidents which form the cortège of nature; thus did he admit also tears, in leaving often to the body a suffering which is natural to it"<sup><a href="#fn386" id="ref386">386</a></sup>. O the admirable and authentic wisdom of the Doctor! Or rather: the divine operation of the Spirit who acted in him so that he might make this declaration! For he has gathered everything summarily without retracting anything of what contributes to precision! He began by saying that the Lord had hunger, without separating in two the incarnate God; in second place he made resound (the intervention of) the will in the sufferings by many and significant words, in saying clearly that he had supported hunger, that he had admitted thirst and that he had tolerated tears; thirdly he professed to refer them to the natural character and to the truth of the sufferings of the body, in calling them natural accidents of the flesh and in assigning to each of the sufferings a natural cause, by virtue of which it is naturally brought to be assuaged: to hunger, the dissolution of foods; to thirst, the deficiency of the humor (of the body); to the fatigue of the way traveled, the failure of the nerves; to tears, the exhalation of affliction by the humor which spreads in traversing the outlet of the eyes: this also he has clearly added to the words which have been cited above<sup><a href="#fn387" id="ref387">387</a></sup>. For the author of nature, the Word of God, willed to become incarnate in a flesh which is ours, to submit voluntarily to the laws of nature and to place himself, by his will, under the constraining conditions of the sufferings, gaining for us in this way the healing of each one of them and transmitting to the entire race, by the intermediary of his true flesh, what was accomplished. We have adduced above John the bishop of Constantinople who said: [CHRYSOSTOM] "Now Christ had a body exempt from sin, and not disengaged from the natural necessities, otherwise there would not have been a body"<sup><a href="#fn388" id="ref388">388</a></sup>, while adding again that it is voluntarily and of his own free will that he had supported this and that he had died, until he had accomplished all that contributes to our redemption; the text itself is thus conceived: [CHRYSOSTOM] "... and that death reached the body only at the moment when he himself willed it. Now he willed that it be after having accomplished all. It is for this that he said: 'I have the power to lay down my soul and I have the power to take it up again'<sup><a href="#fn389" id="ref389">389</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn390" id="ref390">390</a></sup>. Not indeed that the all-powerful Word of God, who had even healed the infirmities of others and resurrected the dead by the contact of his flesh, would not have been able to prevent that it come to make the experience of the passions and of death! But this would have been nothing other than to destroy the entire economy for which he had made himself man. For it is to undergo our sufferings and destroy their power, die our death and suppress the fall by the resurrection that, without change, he became man. This which, the venerable Cyril has already instructed us above concerning the thirst (experienced) on the cross, when he says: [CYRIL] "... finally the flesh experienced something that is proper to its nature. It admitted thirst, dried up as a result of the various wounds. It is that violent pains generally provoke an overwhelming thirst, by absorbing, under the effect of an inexpressible physical heat, the moisture hidden in the depths (of the body), and by consuming, through inflammatory pains, the interior of the patient. It was not difficult indeed, for the Word of God who can do all, to avert this also from his flesh. But as he had, by his will, consented to experience all the rest, he experienced this also by the will of his spirit. And that is why he asked for a drink"<sup><a href="#fn391" id="ref391">391</a></sup>. In the same manner the very illustrious Athanasius, in the third discourse On the Trinity, in the book Against the Infamous Arians, said: [ATHANASIUS] "From then on, one should rather be astonished that the Word was in such a passible flesh, that he did not prevent those who tortured him and did not take vengeance on his murderers, although he could, he who had averted others from death and who had resurrected the dead from among the dead, but that he had consented that his body suffer. For it is for this indeed that he also came, as I have said previously, so that he might suffer in the flesh and that henceforth the flesh might be constituted impassible and immortal and, as we have frequently repeated, so that in him befalling him, the opprobrium and all that had befallen him might no longer reach men, but that they might be completely annihilated by him, and that these might henceforth remain forever incorruptible, as the temple of the Word"<sup><a href="#fn392" id="ref392">392</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">All therefore confess unanimously and without contestation that the flesh of our Savior Christ suffered voluntary sufferings; and which healed our weakness, it itself being passible in its nature and in no way, while it suffered, at once passible and impassible and immortal, like the bush which, at once, as piety has said, burned and enjoyed incombustibility; but the incarnate Word, willing that his flesh undergo what is proper to it, welcomed death also according to the law of nature, so that the same might be considered, according as he had become man, as having suffered and being dead truly in a body naturally apt to suffer and to die, and that it might be believed, according as he is God, that he had remained above all sufferings and death and that he was going to become for us, thanks to his own body, the new first fruits of resurrection and, from then on, of incorruptibility, that is to say of impassibility and immortality. The wise in the Spirit Athanasius said indeed: [ATHANASIUS] "For it is for this indeed that he also came, as I have said previously, so that he might suffer in the flesh and that henceforth his flesh might be constituted impassible and immortal"<sup><a href="#fn393" id="ref393">393</a></sup>. It is therefore after the sufferings that the flesh was henceforth constituted impassible and immortal by the resurrection and it had, in the sufferings themselves, neither impassibility nor immortality: this is the impossible thing far from the holy Scriptures and the inspired words! For in the psalms of the divine David also, the sufferings of the Emmanuel were clearly prefigured, in many places, in which it is proclaimed in advance, as emanating from his person: "They gave me gall for my food and, for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink"<sup><a href="#fn394" id="ref394">394</a></sup> and "They have added to the pain of my wounds"<sup><a href="#fn395" id="ref395">395</a></sup>. Indeed, while he was attached by nails to the cross and was struck because of our sins, the Jews added to it sarcasm, opprobrium, insults, mockery full of the audacity of blasphemies. Observe also, I pray you, the precision of the word of the Spirit; for he did not say: "They have added to my wounds", but "to the pain of my wounds", to show clearly that it is not in appearance that the sufferings of the flesh in which the wounds had been made took place, but that it had been afflicted and had suffered, the Word himself willing it; and not that it had been without suffering nor affliction, it which would have appeared to suffer, whereas in truth it felt nothing and did not suffer!</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now this is what is also attested, with the words of the doctors which are drawn above, by the venerable John, who was bishop of Jerusalem. — It was in his time that the precious body of Saint Stephen the first martyr was discovered, by a divine revelation. — It is his symbol, directed against those who, concerning the incarnation, think in an impious manner of appearance, which was taken up, in his treatise, by Timothy, the bishop of Alexandria; all his life long, he offered an armed resistance, equally by his words and by his acts, to the error of the Phantasiasts and to those who say two natures and two persons. Here is what he cites in this same symbol: [JOHN OF JERUSALEM] "We confess that, when the God Word, the eternal and Only-begotten Son of God, for the redemption of the human race, had been born of the holy Virgin Mary and of the Holy Spirit, — of a woman, as the Apostle said<sup><a href="#fn396" id="ref396">396</a></sup>, — and that he had taken from her a flesh truly, and not in appearance, consubstantial to our flesh, he truly endured sufferings for us: he experienced the fatigue of the journey traveled, like us also and not in appearance, and like us also he slept and, like us, he felt the pain of the blows, when he was scourged before Pilate; and when his cheeks were struck, he endured the sufferings of it, and when his hands and feet were pierced by nails, he felt the painful suffering of it, as Isaiah said concerning him: 'He took upon himself our sins and it is for us that he was struck. And we, we thought that he was in pain, maltreated and infirm; but it is he who was struck because of our sins and who was weakened because of our iniquities'<sup><a href="#fn397" id="ref397">397</a></sup> and again: 'a man who was struck and knowing how to bear illnesses'<sup><a href="#fn398" id="ref398">398</a></sup>. And we share the sentiment of the divine Paul, when he says this concerning him: 'For we do not have a high priest incapable of sympathizing with our weaknesses, he who has passed through all the same trials as we, except sin'<sup><a href="#fn399" id="ref399">399</a></sup>. And we confess that he had a rational soul which endured sufferings for us, like our souls to us, and which truly underwent the sufferings of our soul, that is to say sadness, trouble and anguish. For it is this that the evangelists teach concerning him, when they attest that he said: 'My soul is sorrowful even unto death'<sup><a href="#fn400" id="ref400">400</a></sup> and 'Behold, now my soul is troubled'<sup><a href="#fn401" id="ref401">401</a></sup>. It is also written concerning him in the gospel of Mark: 'He began to be seized by sadness and anguish'<sup><a href="#fn402" id="ref402">402</a></sup>. And as we confess that the passions of his flesh took place in truth and not in appearance, so we believe that those of the soul took place in truth and not in appearance. As for those who say that, while he was scourged, he felt no pain, or that, while he was crucified, he did not suffer, when the nails penetrated him, we anathematize them as heretics. But we confess that he truly died for our sins, that his body was placed in the tomb, where it remained without his soul, and that, after three days, he truly rose from the dead; that after his resurrection he ate and drank with his disciples, truly and not in appearance, that he ascended into heaven and that, at the end of the world, he will come to judge the living and the dead and he will resurrect from the dead the entire human race in incorruptibility, the bodies in which men died and were buried possessing the same nature, as he also possessed the same body, when he rose from the dead"<sup><a href="#fn403" id="ref403">403</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Behold that everywhere it is in a flesh that felt and experienced pain, — an animated body being naturally apt to feel and to suffer, — that the action of the sufferings was truly exercised, as also in the soul, sadness, affliction and trouble are by nature particular sufferings of the rational soul. But all this was proper to the impassible God Word, whom no feeling of sufferings reaches, for the reason that is proper to him, by the hypostatic union, the body provided with soul and spirit which is subject to similar sufferings. That is why by reason of the inseparable character of the union, it is himself who is rightly believed to have experienced pain, to have been in sadness, affliction and trouble, although even in this state he felt none of (these) sufferings, by the fact that he is impassible as God. For he said: "Just as we confess that the sufferings of his body took place in truth and not in appearance, so we believe that those of the soul also took place in truth and not in appearance"<sup><a href="#fn404" id="ref404">404</a></sup>. From then on, even if the sufferings were naturally proper to the body and to the soul, however the Word, incarnate in a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul and naturally apt to undergo them, truly assigned to himself the feeling and the pains of the sufferings, by the fact that he had become man, while remaining impassible as God prior to the ages who, according to his nature, is not subject to sufferings.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">In the same way the very wise Cyril also, in the twelfth book of the Commentary on the gospel of Matthew, declares this: [CYRIL] "Our Savior knows anguish and sadness and he welcomes our sufferings, although he is God who escapes and is above sufferings, so that in all things one might truly recognize that he possesses humanity. For just as it is written that he was fatigued by the journey traveled, although he is the master of the powers and he is himself entirely Power and in all, he is also said to have been hungry, although he is the living bread descended from heaven and who gives life to the world<sup><a href="#fn405" id="ref405">405</a></sup>, thus also he knew anguish, although he is himself total joy, the enjoyment and the happiness of all. And we do not say in any way that he welcomed our sufferings in his nature, the impassible and inviolable Word of God, nor in that he is recognized to be God, but that what was proper to humanity became common to him, because equally what was proper to the Word of God taken separately and concerned only him alone, became common to the flesh by reason of the ineffable and inexplicable union. And although it is the Word who descended from heaven, he also said that the flesh had descended from heaven: 'For no one, he says, has ascended into heaven, except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man'<sup><a href="#fn406" id="ref406">406</a></sup>." And further: [CYRIL] "He submits to the tortures, taking upon himself for us these characteristics which are natural, to deliver us from torments and condemnation. 'For it is by his bruises that we have been healed'<sup><a href="#fn407" id="ref407">407</a></sup>, according to what is written"<sup><a href="#fn408" id="ref408">408</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is therefore not fitting that those who, with the doctors of the holy Church, confess that things happen thus, imitate Nicodemus who, pushed by unbelief and a carnal spirit, declared concerning the divine regeneration operated by baptism: "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?"<sup><a href="#fn409" id="ref409">409</a></sup>. And again: "How can this be?"<sup><a href="#fn410" id="ref410">410</a></sup>. For the Fathers, as instructed by God, understood from the inspired Scriptures this: "If you do not believe, you will not understand either"<sup><a href="#fn411" id="ref411">411</a></sup>, and this: "If you will, seek and dwell with me"<sup><a href="#fn412" id="ref412">412</a></sup>, and this: "Search the Scriptures"<sup><a href="#fn413" id="ref413">413</a></sup>. And it is both by believing and by seeking in a legitimate manner that they dwelt with God, without straying outside nor permitting their thoughts the search for a profane, foreign and deceitful wisdom, acquiring, by the Holy Spirit who searches all<sup><a href="#fn414" id="ref414">414</a></sup>, the intelligence of that of which they took knowledge. It is for this that the intelligent Cyril, in the fourth book of the Commentary on the gospel of John, commenting on what the disciples said to our Lord, our God and Savior, the Christ: "And we, we have believed and known that you are the Christ, the Son of God"<sup><a href="#fn415" id="ref415">415</a></sup>, declares this: [CYRIL] "For they say that they have believed and known, uniting the two things. For it was necessary indeed that they both believe and know. And it is not because divine realities are perceived by faith, that one must henceforth for this reason abstain from research concerning them, but rather apply oneself to rise to a limited knowledge, in a mysterious manner and as in a mirror, as Paul said<sup><a href="#fn416" id="ref416">416</a></sup>. And with certainty again they did not say that they first knew and that afterwards they believed, but after having put faith forward, they added also, afterwards, knowledge. For it is after faith that knowledge is born and not before faith, as it is written: 'If you do not believe, you will not understand either!'<sup><a href="#fn417" id="ref417">417</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn418" id="ref418">418</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Now let your Holiness know that the Fathers did not apply in this manner to the suffering of our Savior the sign and the example of the bush that was burning and was not consumed, — for it is ill-suited and contrary to the total intention of the Economy, as the exposition has shown, — but they brought it as a glorious illustration of the birth of the Emmanuel according to the flesh, to show that, beyond all understanding, God dwelt in the womb of a virgin, that he became incarnate from her without undergoing change, that he neither consumed nor annihilated his mother who carried him nor the flesh that was united to him, endowed with an intelligent soul, and that he did not, in being born, destroy the virginity of her who had given birth to him. Indeed the very wise John bishop of Constantinople, in the homily entitled On the Birth of Christ, writes this: [CHRYSOSTOM] "O bush, which Moses saw on the mountain burning and not being consumed! Virgin Mary, who gives birth and is not corrupted!"<sup><a href="#fn419" id="ref419">419</a></sup>. Likewise also the venerable Theodote, bishop of Ancyra, declared concerning the same account: [THEODOTE] "For the mysteries are prefigured by ancient (symbols); it is for this that the bush burns, that the fire appears without accomplishing the effects of the fire: it illuminates and does not corrupt, it shines and does not consume, it is profitable to it and does not deform it. Do you not see in the bush the Virgin? Do you not grasp in the fire the mercy of him who has come?"<sup><a href="#fn420" id="ref420">420</a></sup>. And the eminent Cyril, in the treatise On Christ is One, says this: [CYRIL] "O our friend, it is rather extravagances that he pronounces who says that there was confusion or mixture, if we profess that the unique nature of the Son became incarnate and became man. For it is impossible for anyone to prove this by solid and compelling reasonings. And if they fix their will as law for us, they conclude a design that they will not be able to sustain. For we attach ourselves preferably to the divine Scripture and not to them! If they think, on the other hand, that the nature of man, because it is nothing beside the divine greatness, was frustrated and absorbed (by it), as they say, once again we say: 'You are mistaken, because you ignore the Scripture and the power of God'<sup><a href="#fn421" id="ref421">421</a></sup>. For it was not difficult for the merciful God to be able to be carried by the measures of humanity. And this is what he made shine forth in advance for our intention in a figurative manner, initiating Moses into the mysteries and describing, still in the form of symbols, the mode of the inhumanation. He descended, indeed, upon a bush in the desert under the appearance of fire; and the fire shone on this plant of modest size, which however was not consumed<sup><a href="#fn422" id="ref422">422</a></sup>. At this vision, Moses was struck with stupor: How did the fire not alter the wood? And how was an easily inflammable matter able to bear the violence of the flame? But the fact was, as I have said, the sign of the mystery which shows that his divine nature, because the God Word willed it, was capable of bearing the human measures; for there is absolutely nothing that is arduous for him!"<sup><a href="#fn423" id="ref423">423</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is therefore with good reason that he made use of this sign and this example, in conformity with the spirit of the divine Scripture, to bring out the intimate relation and the union of the God Word to a flesh endowed with an intelligent soul. But for what concerns the redemptive suffering, he makes use of another example which shows, as far as possible, that the same suffered in the flesh, but that he remained impassible in the divinity and that it was not the flesh which, while suffering, was impassible in the midst of the sufferings. Citing first the question of a contradictor in these terms: "How then do they say that, while he himself suffered, he did not suffer?", he then responds thus: [CYRIL] "By suffering in his own flesh and not in the nature of the divinity the expression concerning this is absolutely ineffable and the spirit, whatever it may be, does not attain ideas as subtle and elevated as those! But following the path of correct reasonings and considering things with the norm that is fitting, we do not render the Word foreign to what he is said to have suffered, to avoid above all saying that the birth according to the flesh is not his, but of someone else, and we do not establish either that what is proper to the flesh was realized in his divine and transcendent nature. He is recognized, as I have said, that he suffered in his own flesh, whereas he did not suffer in a similar manner in the divinity. The whole force of the examples is powerless and does not attain the exactitude of the truth; it nevertheless puts in the spirit a deficient representation of the reality itself and it elevates us from the things which are within our reach towards the height and towards the realities which surpass reason. For just as when iron, or another matter of this kind, placed within reach of the assaults of fire, lets itself be won over by the fire and the flame enters into its midst; that if it happens to be struck from somewhere, the matter receives the wound, but the nature of the fire is harmed in nothing by the one who struck. Think also things of this sort, when the Son is said to have suffered in the flesh without having suffered in his divinity. The force of the example is limited, as I have said, but it brings closer to the truth those who do not wish to oppose the divine words"<sup><a href="#fn424" id="ref424">424</a></sup>. Thus therefore the iron, which has entirely become fire and has welcomed into its bosom all the consuming force of the flame, to the point of no longer being separated from it and of being considered as one with it, receives the wound when it is struck and is subjected to blows while it is straightened or expanded, whereas (of all that) the fire undergoes nothing. It is the same also of the Word of God who became incarnate and made man without undergoing change: while, in a manner that surpasses all understanding, he was without separation in relation to his flesh, — for he was hypostatically united to it, — he himself suffered in nothing, — because he is, in his nature, impassible as God, — but the suffering was proper to him and not foreign, — since the flesh that was united to him was proper to him and not foreign and that in this very flesh the suffering was active; — the latter advanced only unto it alone and was incapable of surpassing it and of reaching the divinity of him who is impassible; in such a way one can believe and recognize, following what is fitting, that the same is impassible in his divinity and passible in his humanity.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">The divine Scriptures and those who have interpreted them have indeed sought many signs and examples, so that, by each sign and each example, might be grasped, as far as possible, an aspect of the divine inhumanation. Thus as pagans, and heretics afflicted with the same spirit as them, said: "How was a pure and immaculate God united to this fetid and impure flesh?", they refuted this senseless objection by another example, showing that the body of Christ our Savior is entirely holy and exempt from all contamination of sin, — this alone being understood as an impurity, — that on the other hand God rather perfects and gratifies with his goods those whom he approaches, without contracting any impurity from them. Indeed the very wise Cyril, in the eighth discourse of the second book Against the Impious Julian, writes this: [CYRIL] "Just as therefore a ray of sun, which descends either on places covered with mud or on other unclean objects, contracts no stain from them, thus also, although the pure and invulnerable nature has joined itself to bodies that come from the earth, it is rather profitable to them, but contracts none of the evils that are of a nature to harm it"<sup><a href="#fn425" id="ref425">425</a></sup>. But again, as long as this example is applied only to the purity and the immaculate character of the divine incarnation and is used only for this sole end, we avoid its ambiguity; for it suggests in some way also the idea of a very close illumination: thus one says that God shone in the prophets and holy men, when he acted in them, illuminated them and made them participants in his grace. For it is in this manner that the sun and fire illuminate a dark place into which they penetrate and communicate to it their own heat, without realizing with it a union according to nature, as the same wise doctor teaches again in the book called Scholia: [CYRIL] "We believe that a very intimate and true union was realized in Christ. But if it is said that he dwelt among us, it is not a dwelling of complacency that he realized, — for in us dwells corporeally all the fullness of the divinity<sup><a href="#fn426" id="ref426">426</a></sup>, — that is to say that it is not by a simple association or by complacency, like a light that illuminates or a fire that deposits its natural heat in what approaches it; but, so to speak, the divine and inviolable nature made of the temple taken from the Virgin something that is known as a dwelling but by a true union, as I have said. For Christ Jesus is recognized as one in this way"<sup><a href="#fn427" id="ref427">427</a></sup>. And, because the example of the light of the sun and of fire is not adapted to express the natural and hypostatic union, he had recourse to another example and he declares in the same Scholia: [CYRIL] "We say therefore that it is fitting to think, — for our language is in any case inferior to the truth, — that the union of the Emmanuel is of the kind of what one would represent to be that of the human soul with its own body"<sup><a href="#fn428" id="ref428">428</a></sup>. Thus every symbol, like every example, is chosen with a view to the sole aspect that suits it, but for the aspect that does not suit it, it falls out of place and is rejected. And resorting also to the symbol when he addresses Acacius, bishop of Scythopolis, he says this: [CYRIL] "But let the examples be understood in the manner that suits them. They are inferior to the truth and they sometimes give only a partial signification of the things figured"<sup><a href="#fn429" id="ref429">429</a></sup>. Likewise also Gregory the Theologian, in the treatise On the Holy Spirit, declares concerning the question of the Holy Trinity also that we must draw from every image and every example the sole aspect that will be fitting, and reject and neglect the others which do not fit: [GREGORY] "And in brief, there is nothing that does not fix the thought, when one examines in an example a thing to which the spirit applies, except in the case where one takes from the image a certain aspect and that, in a just thought, one rejects the others"<sup><a href="#fn430" id="ref430">430</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore the symbol and the example of the bush that was burning and was not consumed were taken by the doctors in conformity with the proprieties and the spirit of the divine Scripture, to represent the union of the God Word with the flesh or the indwelling in the holy Virgin, so that it might appear, even if only weakly, how the human flesh had borne the proximity and the indwelling of the divinity to which no one accedes without being absorbed, consumed or perishing. "The virtue of the Most High will dwell in you", said Gabriel to Mary<sup><a href="#fn431" id="ref431">431</a></sup>. But no one has used the bush as an image of redemptive suffering, in the sense that it would say that the passible flesh, in the midst of sufferings, both suffered and did not suffer, like the bush which burned and was not consumed: while merely calling it, without further ado, by a misleading term, subject to sufferings, one would on the other hand deny, upon closer inspection, the scope of the term, and this, while the holy Scriptures openly proclaim that Christ underwent the trial of sufferings as we do except for sin<sup><a href="#fn432" id="ref432">432</a></sup> and that he tasted death without thereby rejecting the possibility of a flesh that suffered like ours, nor true death nor authentic sufferings, because it is for our sins and not for his own, for our Savior is without sin, and without there being any constraint for himself, that he suffered voluntarily, that he died and, by reason of the promptness of his resurrection, that he rendered, so to speak, unknown the trial of his death.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And that it is so, John, bishop of Constantinople, also shows in the fourth discourse of the Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews, writing this: [CHRYSOSTOM] "And it is in truth that he said that he tasted death for all<sup><a href="#fn433" id="ref433">433</a></sup>, and not that he will die; for just as he truly tasted it, thus he remained in it only a short time and immediately rose from it. And by saying therefore: 'because of the suffering of death', he signified true death; and by saying 'superior to the angels', he made understood the resurrection. For just as the doctor who does not feel the necessity of tasting the food prepared for the sick, out of solicitude for the sick, tastes it himself first, to persuade the patient to take heart with confidence to take food, thus, as all men dreaded death, to persuade them to despise death, he himself tasted death, although he had no necessity for it. For he says: 'The prince of this world comes and he has no power over me'<sup><a href="#fn434" id="ref434">434</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn435" id="ref435">435</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And again in the fifth discourse: [CHRYSOSTOM] "Our sufferings do not escape him: he knows them not only as God, but he also knows them as man by the temptation which tested him. He underwent many: he knows how to suffer with us, although he is impassible God. But he recounts here what pertains to the incarnation, as if he said that the flesh of Christ underwent many evils, that he knows what affliction is, no less than we who suffer"<sup><a href="#fn436" id="ref436">436</a></sup>. And again after this in the seventeenth discourse he says: [CHRYSOSTOM] "And for what reason is it that he 'died once'? Because he became a ransom for a single death. For he had established that all men would die<sup><a href="#fn437" id="ref437">437</a></sup>. Now this 'he died once' is understood: for the whole world. What then? Shall we no longer die that death? We shall certainly die of it, but we shall not remain in it; which is no longer dying! For there is tyranny of death and true death, when it is not permitted to him who dies to return to life; but when, after our death, it is possible for us to live, and of a superior life, that is no longer death, but sleep. Because death was destined to seize all men, it is for that reason that he died to deliver us from it"<sup><a href="#fn438" id="ref438">438</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, as I have said, no one among the eminent doctors used the example of the bush with the intention of signifying that, while the flesh of our Lord suffered, at the moment of sufferings and of his death, it was at the same time incorruptible, that is to say impassible and immortal, but rather so that its passibility and its mortal character at the moment of sufferings and of his death might be recognized in this thing which became the prey of the flames; and, in the fact that it was not consumed, that of not remaining in death, of not being completely prisoner of it and of being rendered, by the resurrection, immortal, impassible and incorruptible. Look, I pray you, at John, in the thirteenth homily of the Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians, who takes the example of the bush with the intention that I have said: [CHRYSOSTOM] "And how is presented what the Scriptures have declared, that he was also buried and that he would rise on the third day? By the symbol of Jonah that our Lord himself gave when he said: 'Just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the monster, thus also the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth'<sup><a href="#fn439" id="ref439">439</a></sup>. By the bush in the desert: for just as it was inflamed and was not consumed, thus also this body died but was not held forever by death. There is the dragon which, in Daniel, figures it: for just as after having taken the food that the prophet had given it, it was broken in the middle, thus also, when Sheol had absorbed this body, it broke, because the body itself pierced its entrails and rose again"<sup><a href="#fn440" id="ref440">440</a></sup>. Thus therefore the mortal character of the body and its immortality are distinguished according to the times. On the one hand, it was mortal at the time of death and of sufferings, for Our Lord suffered voluntarily in the flesh and he died, according to what is written, immortal on the other hand, that is to say incorruptible and impassible, at the time of the resurrection. And this other thing also clearly follows from the word of the Doctor: what the doctors have declared many times, that the flesh of our Lord was not held by death, was said concerning a complete detention; for he clearly said this: "This body also died, but was not completely held by death"<sup><a href="#fn441" id="ref441">441</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is however to deviate much from what is fitting and necessary to introduce the miracle into the debate and to declare this: Just as our Savior walked on the sea and multiplied the five loaves, to the point of satisfying five thousand men, not counting the children and the women, and showed twelve baskets filled with the leftovers, just as he entered into a dwelling, the doors being closed, and stood in the midst of the assembled disciples, thus one must say that even in the passible body of our Lord and during his sufferings, while he suffered voluntarily for others, incorruptibility, that is to say impassibility and immortality, always maintained itself. For concerning the natural and human sufferings, the doctors have taught us to understand and to say that the flesh welcomed them naturally, but that the God Word, who remained impassible above all, also assigned to himself as his own, by reason of his ineffable union with the body, the passions, by voluntarily permitting the flesh to undergo them; as for the miracles, that we understand and confess them as befitting God and not as befitting man; that the passions occurred according to the natural law, the Word willing it thus, that the miracles on the other hand were accomplished above the laws of nature. For thus also, the death of which our Savior died for us in the flesh occurred according to the law of human nature, but it is an operation befitting God, who willed to die in a human manner, that was the resurrection. And this, we have heard the wise Cyril who, in the Discourse to the Emperor Theodosius, taught it in this way: [CYRIL] "... he who died according to the law of the flesh and to our nature and who rose again. If dying is a human suffering, he, in rising again, revealed a divine operation"<sup><a href="#fn442" id="ref442">442</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore it is not by reason of the divine and supernatural operation of the resurrection that we will deny that our Lord and God Jesus Christ underwent death and the other sufferings according to the law of the flesh and in our nature, and it is not because the miracles are above nature that we say for that reason that the sufferings are not natural. And it is not because those are divine, that these are no longer human. But the divine and human characteristics belong to one and the same, without them being in any way distributed between the two natures, because Christ is one, from two, from the divinity and the humanity, a unique person, a unique hypostasis and a unique nature of the God Word incarnate who, according to the divinity and above man, and indeed still more above every created nature, accomplished miracles and, according to the humanity, experienced human sufferings, voluntary and which healed ours. For the Emmanuel, as the doctor says in the same discourse, [CYRIL] "... is composed of human characteristics and also of characteristics which surpass man in something unique situated in the middle. For he is the mediator between God and men, according to what is written<sup><a href="#fn443" id="ref443">443</a></sup>, who is, on the one hand, God by nature and not outside the flesh and, on the other hand, truly man and not an ordinary man like us; and he is what he was, even if he became flesh"<sup><a href="#fn444" id="ref444">444</a></sup>. Thus therefore when the Roman pierced his side with a blow of the lance, this wound constituted a human suffering, for it was proper to a human body, even inanimate, to be torn and pierced by iron: for it is after he had given up the spirit, says the evangelist John, that the Roman had this audacity; but that blood and water came out of the side at the same time and that from there sprang gloriously the source of the life-giving mysteries in which we are purified, there is divine perfection and operation. For, even if the soul and the body were separated from one another in death, the Word of God was united to both by a superior union, because he is plenitude as God and is not divided in space: through the intermediary of the soul he realized the descent into hell by breaking the unbreakable bonds of that place, on the other hand by the burial of the body he was in the tomb the seed of the resurrection, he rose again in this manner as befits God and he broke the empire of death and of corruption, because it was absolutely impossible that he be held by them; he became for all men the first fruits of incorruptibility, of impassibility and of immortality because he died and rose again for all; he voluntarily welcomed the human character of the sufferings, because he had truly become man, and he accomplished miracles as befits God, because he was God by nature; and he deified us through the intermediary of his flesh and raised us from the dead so that we might become gods.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">This is what one sees Saint Athanasius also confirm in the third discourse of the book On the Trinity against the infamous Arians: [ATHANASIUS] "From then on indeed the flesh was risen and deified and it was no longer fitting for it, while he ascended into the heavens, to respond according to the flesh, but rather to teach henceforth according to the divinity: 'It does not belong to you to know the times and the moments that the Father has fixed by his own authority'<sup><a href="#fn445" id="ref445">445</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn446" id="ref446">446</a></sup>. And that he was for us the origin of what we become, so to speak, gods, understand of immortality, and that he accomplished everything for our intention by establishing even for the conditions which are ours a way by what is proper to him, he indicates it in the second discourse of the same book, saying this: [ATHANASIUS] "Thus therefore the truth itself shows that the Word is not among the creatures, but that he is rather their own creator. For thus he also assumed a created and human body, so that, renewing this very one in himself as creator, he might deify it and in this manner introduce us all, in his image, into the kingdom of the heavens"<sup><a href="#fn447" id="ref447">447</a></sup>. And again in what precedes: [ATHANASIUS] "In him therefore the human race was rendered perfect and returned to its first state, such as it was when it was made in the beginning, by a grace clearly greater. For after we shall be raised from among the dead, we shall no longer fear death, but we shall reign always in Christ in the heavens"<sup><a href="#fn448" id="ref448">448</a></sup>. And again: [ATHANASIUS] "It is therefore to bear witness, to accept death for us, to raise men and to destroy the works of Satan that our Savior came, and such is indeed the cause of his coming in the flesh: otherwise, if death had not occurred, there would have been no resurrection; and how would death have occurred, if he had not had a body susceptible of dying?"<sup><a href="#fn449" id="ref449">449</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore these ideas are clearly distinguished by the doctors and by the holy Scriptures: it is in a mortal and passible body that our Savior endured the sufferings and death and it is by the resurrection that he became incorruptible, that is to say impassible and immortal, whereas from the origin he held in himself the impossibility of sin and of holiness; for the two things are clearly reported by Scripture, both that he did not commit sin and that he suffered in the flesh and that he died in the flesh. Let us not therefore be troubled in any way if, reading their works and their words, we find them declaring that it is by the incarnation of the Word of God that death and corruption have been destroyed. For these declarations aim by anticipation at the term of the resurrection; for from the foundation and the beginning the entire reason of the economy is perfect and everything is considered complete: it is by reason of the term, that is to say of the death and the resurrection, that the very foundation of the becoming of Christ in the flesh was laid. I have moreover shown that this also the venerable John, bishop of Constantinople, had taught in this manner, when he explains the word of Christ to his Father: [CHRYSOSTOM] "The work that you had given me, I have accomplished<sup><a href="#fn450" id="ref450">450</a></sup>. And that, although until that moment it was only the beginning, let us say: not even the beginning of the work! How does he say: 'I have accomplished'? It can only be this: either everything that fell to me, I have done, or he speaks of the future as a thing past, or, and this is what must be said above all, that everything was henceforth easy by the fact that the root of the goods had been planted, from which must necessarily emanate also the fruits"<sup><a href="#fn451" id="ref451">451</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is assuredly for this also that it happens that the most holy Athanasius says, aiming equally at the term of the resurrection, that from the incarnation of the God Word, death and corruption had been destroyed and that henceforth the body, according to its nature, would no longer be corrupted, by reason of the coming that the Word had made in it. He writes indeed in the Catechetical Discourse on the corporeal appearance of Our Lord Jesus-Christ this way of seeing: [ATHANASIUS] "The body therefore, inasmuch as it also possessed the nature common to all, for it was a human body, and although by a new prodigy it had been constituted only from a Virgin, it was nevertheless mortal and, following the order of beings which are similar to it, was susceptible of death. Now by the coming of the Word in it it was no longer corrupted according to its nature but, because of the Word of God who inhabited it, it was liberated from corruption"<sup><a href="#fn452" id="ref452">452</a></sup>. And to indicate that the accomplishment of what he said would coincide with the term of the resurrection, the doctor immediately unveils with clarity what he has declared and shows that he became incarnate in a body capable of dying only to destroy in a marvelous manner, by passing through a death which truly occurred, the power of the corruption of death by the resurrection; here is what he adds by saying this: [ATHANASIUS] "And it came to pass that the two prodigies were realized gloriously in him: the death common to all was accomplished in the body of the Lord and death itself and corruption were destroyed because of the Word united to the body. For there was need of a death and it was necessary that a death occur for all, so that what was owed by all might occur. Also, as I have said previously many times, since it was impossible for him to die, for he was immortal, the Word took upon himself a body that could die, in order to offer for all this very one, as being his own, and, as suffering himself for all, for having made the body his own, in order to destroy Satan who held the power of death and 'to deliver all those whom the fear of death devoted all their life long to slavery'<sup><a href="#fn453" id="ref453">453</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn454" id="ref454">454</a></sup>. And again: [ATHANASIUS] "It is for this indeed that he did not consent that his body remain there long, but he showed that death had only touched it and on the third day he quickly raised it by detaching from it the yoke of death and by gratifying men, as a sign of victory over death, with the incorruptibility and the impassibility of which his body had been the seat. For it would have been possible for him to raise immediately the body from death and to exhibit it again alive. But although having well envisaged that in advance, our Savior did not do it. For one could perhaps have said even that he was not at all dead, or that death had in no way approached him, if immediately after death he had manifested the resurrection; and moreover, if the moment of death had coincided with that of the resurrection, the grace of incorruptibility would not have been rendered manifest. Therefore, in order that it might appear that the body was dead, the Word even let one day pass in the interval and after three days he showed it to all incorruptible. So that it might appear therefore that death had occurred in the body, he raised it on the third day; to avoid, on the other hand, when he would finally have raised it after it had long remained there and had become completely corrupted, that one would contest that it was indeed the same body itself, but that the Word had produced another body, for it was possible with time that one would not believe in what was manifested and that one would forget what had occurred, for this very reason he did not tolerate more than three days"<sup><a href="#fn455" id="ref455">455</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It results therefore before all from this doctrine also what Peter, the head of the apostolic college, said precisely concerning our savior the Christ: "Because it was not possible that he be held by the corruption of death"<sup><a href="#fn456" id="ref456">456</a></sup>, and not that he in no way tasted death in the flesh nor was subjected to its yoke; that he on the contrary tore this away by the resurrection from among the dead on the third day and that he did not submit to total corruption nor to dissolution. For the Doctor has said: "on the third day he quickly raised the body, by detaching from it the yoke of death"<sup><a href="#fn457" id="ref457">457</a></sup>. And again: "He raised it on the third day to avoid, when he would finally have raised it after it had long remained there and had become completely corrupted, that one would believe that it was not this body that he had produced, but indeed another"<sup><a href="#fn458" id="ref458">458</a></sup>. Also he tasted the violence generating the corruption of death and he came to experience it unto the tomb; for this was indeed what entered into the foresight: to pass through all our sufferings, except for sin, to destroy in this manner the power and the force that they made weigh upon us, as well as the royalty that death held and exercised, by means of the resurrection. It is from this that incorruptibility, which is impassibility and immortality, drew its origin, by clearing a path in the entire human race of which he had been the first fruits: just as death came by a man, it is by a man also that the resurrection of the dead came, as the Apostle said<sup><a href="#fn459" id="ref459">459</a></sup>. He therefore who, while he is God and author of every creature, became man without undergoing change for this very purpose of becoming for us a principle of resurrection, of incorruptibility, of immortality and of impassibility, how would the blameless and voluntary sufferings, death and the sepulcher diminish him, they which he welcomed and bore for the very purpose that the resurrection, immortality and incorruptibility might take place, and that they be given to us in addition? For if death had not preceded it, how would the resurrection have followed? That is why the Word of God hypostatically united to himself a corruptible body, that is to say mortal and passible, so that, necessarily, to the suffering and death would succeed immediately the resurrection, incorruptibility, immortality and impassibility. It was therefore impossible that death not come, just as it could not be that the resurrection not come, because the Word willed to make himself man for this end and he made of this the motive of his incarnation: to have accepted to die for us and to destroy by the resurrection the power of corruption and of death, proclaiming through the intermediary of the prophet Isaiah: "My entire design will be realized and I will accomplish all that I have dreamed"<sup><a href="#fn460" id="ref460">460</a></sup>. That is why the very wise Athanasius also, in the same treatise, declares again this: [ATHANASIUS] "He who is not certain of the resurrection, seems to ignore the power of the Word and of the Wisdom of God. For, in a word, if he took upon himself a body and appropriated this one according to the mercy of the Father, as the exposition has shown, what was it necessary that our Lord do with it or what is the term that was fitting to befall the body, once the Word had come into it? For not to die was impossible since it was mortal and it was offered to death for all, for which purpose our Savior had attached it to himself. On the other hand, it could not be that it remain in death, because it had become the temple of Life. Therefore he died as mortal; he returned to life because of the Life which was in him and his works are a demonstration of the resurrection"<sup><a href="#fn461" id="ref461">461</a></sup>. And again in the third discourse of the book On the Trinity against the impious Arians he delivers an analogous teaching by declaring: [ATHANASIUS] "For it is not in him who did not take a body that what belongs to the body would have occurred, if he had not taken a corruptible and mortal body. For she was mortal, holy Mary from whom the body issued. Also, since he was in a body that suffered, wept and toiled, one must attribute to him, with the body, also what is proper to the flesh. If therefore he wept and knew trouble, it was not the Word himself, in that he is Word, who wept and knew trouble, but that belonged to the flesh. If on the other hand he asked that the cup pass away, it is not the divinity itself that experienced fear, but this suffering also was proper to the humanity. And the words: 'Why have you forsaken me?'<sup><a href="#fn462" id="ref462">462</a></sup>, as it appears also in what has been said above, whereas the Word himself endured nothing, for he is impassible, the evangelists have still spoken of them as if they were his, because he became man and because it is by the man that they were said, so that by suppressing himself these sufferings of the flesh, he would have rendered it free of them! And from then on it was impossible also that our Lord be abandoned by the Father, because he was always in him, both before he spoke and after he had uttered this word. And one must not say either that the Lord experienced fear before whom the infernal gatekeepers were terrified and abandoned hell, the sepulchers were opened and many bodies of saints rose and appeared to their familiars. Let every heretic therefore be silent and let him tremble to say that the Lord experienced fear, he before whom death fled like the dragon, whom the demons dread and whom the sea fears, because of whom the heavens are divided and all the powers are shaken! For behold that at the moment when he said: 'Why have you forsaken me?'<sup><a href="#fn463" id="ref463">463</a></sup>, the Father showed that even then, as at all times, he was in him; for the earth, recognizing its Lord who spoke, was immediately seized with terror, the curtain was torn, the sun hid itself and, as I have said, the tombs opened and the dead who were there rose again. And behold what is admirable: those who were then there and had at first denied him, confessed finally at this sight that he was truly the Son of God<sup><a href="#fn464" id="ref464">464</a></sup>. As for the word: 'If it is possible, let this cup pass from me!'<sup><a href="#fn465" id="ref465">465</a></sup>..." that they learn: how, while having said that, he rebuked Peter and declared to him: 'Your views are not those of God'<sup><a href="#fn466" id="ref466">466</a></sup>. It is because he willed that very thing which he refused and for which he had come. But he made it his own to will, — for it was for this that he had come, — it was on the other hand proper to the flesh to fear; it is therefore as a man that he pronounced that word. And it is again by the same that the two declarations were made, in order to show that he was God, that very one who willed and who possessed, having become man, a flesh that feared, for the sake of which he had combined his will with human weakness; in this way, by suppressing the latter, he would render man again courageous against death. Here therefore is the truly glorious thing: he whom the adversaries of Christ estimated to be speaking under the effect of fear, rendered men, by this imaginary fear, courageous and intrepid. It is thus that after him the blessed apostles, on the basis of these words, despised death to the point of not concerning themselves with those who judged them, but of saying: 'We must obey God rather than men'<sup><a href="#fn467" id="ref467">467</a></sup>. As for the other holy martyrs, they were of such valor as to think that they were entering into life rather than undergoing death<sup><a href="#fn468" id="ref468">468</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">We must therefore experience neither fright nor confusion because of the voluntary stripping and the poverty of the Word, given that, from God that he was, he became man for us, without undergoing change, and hypostatically united a body provided with soul and spirit, suffering as we do and consubstantial with us, so that, undergoing our sufferings exempt from all sin and dying our death, he might destroy their strength by the resurrection. For it is the same who was, without division, God and man, that is to say God made man, a unique person, a unique hypostasis and incarnate nature, that of the God Word himself. And by the divine signs, on the one hand, he manifested clearly that he was God, by the voluntary and human sufferings, on the other hand, that he had truly become man. It is therefore not at all by piety that some, in the thought of instituting a defense, overturning the order of the economy with regard to the divine character of the miracles and the glorious birth of the Virgin Mother of God, deny the passible and mortal character of the body, turn the authenticity of the sufferings into conjecture and let themselves be caught by the nets of the Eutychians and the elder Manicheans; or on the contrary, with regard to the human character of the sufferings and of death, they declare in a blasphemous manner, like Paul of Samosata, Photinus, Nestorius and those who follow them, that he is a man who suffered and not an incarnate God who, in that which is naturally apt to suffer, that is to say in the flesh, truly endured everything and who confirms, by the passions and death, that in entering into combat with death through the sufferings in a corruptible body, that is to say mortal and passible, and in undergoing their trial, he rendered powerless the power of corruption thanks to the resurrection and he inaugurated incorruptibility, impassibility and immortality for us, men of his race according to the flesh, because he became the first-born from among the dead<sup><a href="#fn469" id="ref469">469</a></sup>. For the Doctor has clearly taught also in the text which has just been cited that to call the body of our Savior Christ corruptible is the same thing as to call it passible and mortal, by writing this: [ATHANASIUS] "For it is not in him who did not take a body that what belongs to the body would have occurred, unless he had taken a corruptible and mortal body. For she was mortal, holy Mary from whom the body issued. Also, since he was in a body that suffered, wept and toiled, one must attribute to him, with the body, also what is proper to the flesh"<sup><a href="#fn470" id="ref470">470</a></sup>. Behold that he calls indifferently the same body corruptible, mortal, suffering, and not being distant, from the moment of the incarnation, from the aptitude to suffer and to die, but also undergoing, in the very trial of death and sufferings, what is proper to it and, by the resurrection, rendered living and becoming incorruptible and immortal. For he said: "From then on he died as mortal; he returned to life because of the Life which was in him and (his) works are a demonstration of the resurrection"<sup><a href="#fn471" id="ref471">471</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But if it frightens us to say that the body of our Savior was corruptible before the resurrection, whereas the doctors of piety have expressed themselves clearly in this manner, if we experience fear — which is superfluous and misplaced! — because we imagine attributing to him then the corruption and contamination resulting from sin, let us not consent either to confess him passible, because it is the shameful passions, which fall under the culpability of sin, that are called passions in the proper sense, as the venerable Gregory, bishop of Nyssa, has taught in what was examined above, the others being improperly called passions<sup><a href="#fn472" id="ref472">472</a></sup>. However, just as the doctors have confessed him passible because the body is naturally apt to undergo the blameless passions, thus they have called him corruptible because he is also naturally apt to be corrupted by these same blameless passions and by death<sup><a href="#fn473" id="ref473">473</a></sup>, without in any way denying for that the authenticity of the flesh of Our Lord nor the similarity of his passions to ours, by reason of the divine character of his birth from the Virgin and the glory of the miracles. Thus let us hear the eminent Cyril declaring this: [CYRIL] "When therefore the power of death is exercised only in that which is naturally apt to be corrupted, it is there again that one rightly recognizes also the force of the resurrection, so that the force of that tyrant might also be destroyed. The fact that our Lord entered, the doors being closed, will be classified by the wise among his other prodigies"<sup><a href="#fn474" id="ref474">474</a></sup>. Thus therefore if death occurred in a natural manner in the body, because it is naturally apt to be corrupted, entering, the doors being closed, is a miracle. Now a miracle is accomplished above nature and beyond all reason. But we will not deny, because of his glorious and supernatural miracles, that the voluntary sufferings of the Savior occurred following the law of human nature; and we do not say either in an impious manner, because of the humiliating character of the sufferings, that he who was affected by them is not he who, as God, realized the power of miracles and prodigies. For it appears by these two aspects, by what he accomplished in a divine manner and by what he underwent according to humanity, that the same, while being God by nature, had also truly become man.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And that it is so, Saint Athanasius confirms again in the Letter to Maximus the philosopher, by writing this: [ATHANASIUS] "Thus, even when he had become man, we saw his glory, as it is written<sup><a href="#fn475" id="ref475">475</a></sup>, glory befitting the Only-Begotten, full of grace and truth. For what he underwent in his body, that very thing he magnified as God. He experienced hunger in the flesh and he satisfied, according to the divinity, those who were hungry. And if someone is scandalized by these bodily characteristics, let him believe by reason of what he accomplished as God. For he inquired, according to the divinity, where Lazarus had been laid, but he raised him according to the divinity. Also let no one speak ironically of a small child nor pronounce the words of age and growth, of eating, drinking and suffering, lest in rejecting what is proper to the body, he also totally refuse his coming for us. And just as it was not according to the order of nature that he became man, thus it was fitting also that after having taken a body, he manifested what is proper to the body, so that the illusion of Manes the atheist might not prevail. It was fitting on the other hand also that after having come corporeally, he did not hide what is proper to the divinity, so that Paul of Samosata might not find there a pretext. Therefore, having regard to all this, let the unbeliever learn that he was a small child in the manger, but that, on the other hand, he dominated the magi, being adored by them; that as a child he descended into Egypt, but that he destroyed idolatry, the work of hands, and that, crucified in the flesh, he brought back to life the dead who had decomposed for considerable times. And it is evident to anyone that it was not for himself, but for us that he underwent all this, so that, clothing ourselves, thanks to these sufferings, with impassibility and immortality, we might remain for eternal life"<sup><a href="#fn476" id="ref476">476</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">It is not, in fact, to reject the consubstantiality with us nor the passions similar to ours, that Christ God and our Savior was born according to the flesh of the Holy Spirit and of Mary ever Virgin; it is not either in condemning as a corruption and a stain resulting from sin the marriage and the intercourse of man and woman; but because he was to show us ships of the Spirit by holy baptism: he conferred upon us (by this) the removal of carnal generation as a pledge of the removal renewed by the resurrection, so that he himself might become, for us formed and generated anew, the first fruits of that spiritual birth, by being born himself the first in this manner and by becoming a second Adam. For according to the word of our Savior himself: "At the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven"<sup><a href="#fn477" id="ref477">477</a></sup>. Indeed, after Adam, because of sin, had lost the grace of immortality and was destined to decompose into the earth from which he had been taken, the help of marriage presented itself in its time to preserve the race from extinction by the generation of children. Now this very help had been established in advance by God who foresees all; in making man, at the beginning, he made him male and female<sup><a href="#fn478" id="ref478">478</a></sup>. From then on there is in marriage itself no stain of contamination resulting from sin, but it is rather because of the fall of man, which resulted from sin, and the transgression of the precept, that this adjuvant presented itself to this world and to this time. That is why also Christ became man, transforming us (by this fact) for a superior birth, the renewal of the resurrection and an angelic life that lasts eternally.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">This is what the eminent Cyril also wisely teaches, in the work addressed to the most pious emperor Theodosius, by saying: [CYRIL] "It is indeed to become the first in everything, as it is written<sup><a href="#fn479" id="ref479">479</a></sup>, that he was born of a woman<sup><a href="#fn480" id="ref480">480</a></sup>. But as he is the prince of the creation, which is renewed in holiness for God, he is, before the others, he, appeared born of the Spirit, without awaiting the intercourse of man and woman: not that he condemned nature for opprobrium or culpability, — for marriage itself is honorable and he who formed them from the beginning, made them male and female<sup><a href="#fn481" id="ref481">481</a></sup>, — but because, in leading men to a state much superior and incomparably more elevated, he wanted that we should be called born of the Spirit and no longer born of man"<sup><a href="#fn482" id="ref482">482</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And John, the bishop of Constantinople, in the Commentary on the gospel of John, when our Lord addresses Nicodemus, writes this: [CHRYSOSTOM] "For that which is born of the flesh is flesh<sup><a href="#fn483" id="ref483">483</a></sup>. He turns him away from sensible things and does not let him scrutinize the mysteries with these eyes. For it is not, he says, of the flesh that we speak, but of the spirit, Nicodemus. From that moment he has, by this word, referred him to the things on high, so that he might seek nothing among sensible things. For the spirit does not appear to these eyes. Do not think therefore that the spirit engenders carnal objects. Someone will perhaps say: And how is it that our Lord is flesh, since he was not begotten by the Spirit only but also of the flesh? It is moreover to signify the same thing that Paul says: 'Born of a woman, born under the Law'<sup><a href="#fn484" id="ref484">484</a></sup>. The Spirit indeed created him thus: not from that which is not, — otherwise why was the womb required? — but from the virginal flesh; as for the 'how', I cannot explain it! Now this was accomplished so that no one would believe him foreign to our nature. For there are some who, even when this is accomplished, do not believe it, into what impieties have they not fallen, unless he did not have a share in the flesh of the Virgin?"<sup><a href="#fn485" id="ref485">485</a></sup>. Similarly in the commentary on the first letter to the Corinthians: [CHRYSOSTOM] "For it is not the fact of being born from the earth that gives, in an absolute manner, the (character) of being earthly, since Our Lord also was of this same clay and of this same paste, but the accomplishment of things proper to the earth; just as he is heavenly by the fact that he shows things worthy of heaven"<sup><a href="#fn486" id="ref486">486</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And Theophilus who showed a divine and ardent zeal, tempered by the precision of divine doctrine, against the pagans and all the idolaters and who illustrated the see of the Church of Alexandria, writes in the Twenty-first Festal Letter the following: [THEOPHILUS] "He was born a man from a virgin, coming to meet our race in all that we are (constituted), with the exception of sin; but coming according to a marvelous mode of appearance, he blessed human nature"<sup><a href="#fn487" id="ref487">487</a></sup>. And again in the Twenty-fourth: [THEOPHILUS] "For the God Word could create for himself a body as a temple from a body that had not undergone the trial of marriage, when, for our salvation, he came into the world; nor can the order of our nature, which takes its origin from marriage, ever hinder the glorious operation of God; and our Savior who redeemed us was neither contaminated nor profaned, when he gave to the virginal blood the consistency of the flesh for an association full of mercy with us"<sup><a href="#fn488" id="ref488">488</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Similarly also the great and wise theologian Basil, composing a polemical work Against the impious Eunomius, wrote: [BASIL] "The nature of those who are engendered is the same as that of those who engender, even if he who is engendered came into being in another manner. For neither was Abel, who was engendered as a result of coupling, other, nor like Adam, for the reason that Adam was not engendered but was fashioned"<sup><a href="#fn489" id="ref489">489</a></sup>. And further on: [BASIL] "If those who have a different mode of coming into existence, also have a different nature, then men do not belong to a single nature either; for different is the manner of coming into existence of Adam who was fashioned from the earth and different that of Eve who was taken from his side, different that of Abel, who issued from a coupling, and different that of him who (was) taken from Mary, issued from a virgin only"<sup><a href="#fn490" id="ref490">490</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And Athanasius, the apostolic doctor, in what has been cited above, says: [ATHANASIUS] "The body therefore, inasmuch as it had acquired, it also, a nature in common with all, — for it was a human body, — and although by a new prodigy it had been constituted only from a virgin, was nevertheless mortal"<sup><a href="#fn491" id="ref491">491</a></sup>. And again: [ATHANASIUS] "For what belongs to the body would not have occurred in him who did not take a body, if he had not taken a corruptible and mortal body. For she was mortal, holy Mary, from whom the body issued. Also it is fitting, since he became in a body that suffered, wept and toiled, that there be attributed to him, with the body, also what is proper to the flesh"<sup><a href="#fn492" id="ref492">492</a></sup>. And Saint Proclus, also in what has been said above, added this: [PROCLUS] "The God Word therefore became perfect man, without that prodigy which surpasses thought having diminished the unchangeable nature. But this very thing we have learned by faith and we have not attained it by investigation. And, having become man, he redeemed, by suffering as we do, the race which was associated with him according to the flesh"<sup><a href="#fn493" id="ref493">493</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Why therefore, when the doctors call the most holy body of our Lord, God and Savior, Christ, corruptible before the resurrection, in that it is mortal and suffering as we are and subject to the blameless passions, does Your Holiness turn the conversation towards that which is corruptible by virtue of sin? For all confess at once that he is without sin and full of all holiness and that, by that very fact, he is incorruptible from the incarnation. You have written, indeed: [JULIAN] "If they understand what Cyril says, who is among the saints, — that after the resurrection, our Lord had henceforth acquired an incorruptible body<sup><a href="#fn494" id="ref494">494</a></sup>, — that before the resurrection he was corruptible, let them also say that he is in sin"<sup><a href="#fn495" id="ref495">495</a></sup>. But it is easy for us to have recourse against that to the words which have been frequently repeated. As Scripture has said to us concerning our great God and Savior Our Lord Jesus Christ<sup><a href="#fn496" id="ref496">496</a></sup> these two things: that he committed no sin and that deceit was not found in his mouth<sup><a href="#fn497" id="ref497">497</a></sup> and that from the swaddling clothes he rejected evil<sup><a href="#fn498" id="ref498">498</a></sup>, and that, on the other hand, he suffered in the flesh and died in the flesh, the Fathers, who teach the mysteries to those under the sun, by virtue of his being without sin and holy, have declared that incorruptibility always existed in the body of our Savior; but when, by virtue of the submission to blameless sufferings and to death, he had suffered, died for us and was resurrected from among the dead, they have professed him incorruptible and have transmitted to us in writing to confess him thus. For no one has ever been seen to declare that our Lord appeared suffering in an impassible and immortal body; but all have instructed and taught the assemblies over which they were appointed to believe in one and the same, passible according to the flesh and impassible according to the divinity, as the exposition has abundantly demonstrated.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And let Your Piety consider his manner of expression, if it is with good reason that it has declared the human body "in sin". For its unusual character has struck my ears in a strange manner; for until this day I have found no one, among those who have taught in the Greek language in the Church, who has prescribed it in his exposés, because it would give, as it seems to me, a bad idea to those who hear it. For just as he who says the animated body, signifies that there is a natural conjunction of soul and body, thus also he who says the body "in sin", seems to indicate that sin is naturally comprised in the body. And I have said this because of the dissonance of the expression and its unusual character, for it is clear that Your Holiness confesses everywhere that sin befalls man as a disease.. Still it is necessary that wise men like you apply themselves to the exactitude and precision of terms. But perhaps someone will say: We also say of him who has attended a course of rhetoric and who has perfected himself in that discipline, that he has eloquence, and we say of him who has passed through the trial of many things, that he has experience; it is not for that that we think that oratorical discipline and the wealth of experience, — because of the composition (implied in) the expression, — are connatural to man as the body is, naturally, inherent to the soul. Also let him who declares such things know clearly that never has anyone, among the heretics, said that oratorical discipline or art or experience of things are naturally comprised in the constitution and in the nature of man. But, concerning what pertains to sin, the Manicheans and those who reason like them have said, in their blasphemous delirium, that it is mixed, as a natural element, with human paste. And that is why we have said that one must not call the body "in sin", but depart from the character at once suspect and unusual of the expression.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But we must examine with you also this point and make a brief and tight discussion of it! You have written indeed, directing your discourse against those who confess Christ passible in the flesh and, in formulating its absolute decree, that one must in no way call the sufferings corruption, especially given that, with the holy Scriptures, the profane sages themselves supported you. Now what you have said is, in precise terms, the following: [JULIAN] "That the sufferings are not called corruption, nor even among the profane sages"<sup><a href="#fn499" id="ref499">499</a></sup>. I would also like on this point to appease Your Piety and renew the memories of the declarations made on this subject by the profane sages, if at least there remained in me, after so considerable a time, a memory of what comes from them. But I consider rather the holy Scripture which, terrible and with anger, fixes its eyes on me, if I may say so, and cries in my ears some reproach: "Drink water from your own vessels and from the wells of your sources"<sup><a href="#fn500" id="ref500">500</a></sup> and "In the assemblies, bless, from the sources of Israel, the Lord God"<sup><a href="#fn501" id="ref501">501</a></sup>. Now the sources of Israel are those which water the holy assemblies: those which were signed and written by Moses, the visions and revelations of the prophets and all the writings which contain the Old Testament, then, the writings of the evangelists and the apostles, which constitute the New Testament, harmonize perfectly with the Old and show us that it is a unique God who expressed the one and the other; from which it also results that the coming in the flesh of the Only-Begotten Word had to be announced in advance by the voice of the prophets and recognized by that of the apostles. As for the vessels which, from the wells and sources of living water, draw and fill to the brim, to the point of also spilling the drink for others, who are they, if not those eminent men who have been in the churches the ministers of the mysteries and the doctors who, as David said<sup><a href="#fn502" id="ref502">502</a></sup>, opened their mouth and inhaled the Spirit, who were not also simply aware of the thoughts of the profane sages, but who, like Moses, had been instructed in the total wisdom of the Egyptians and by that were rendered the most apt? Thus the apostolic word demands and describes what the doctor of piety must have been: that he have exhorted with a sound word and that he have refuted the contradictors<sup><a href="#fn503" id="ref503">503</a></sup> who had applied themselves to deceitfully trick those who had believed in the great mystery of piety, as Paul himself said, "by means of philosophy and a vain deceit conforming to human tradition and the elements of the world, and not according to Christ"<sup><a href="#fn504" id="ref504">504</a></sup>. Thus therefore it is from the Scriptures cited above and the doctors who have commented on them in the Spirit, that we will undertake the discussion of the opinion which is proposed to us. Thus therefore, since Your Holiness has defined in an absolute manner not to declare in any way the sufferings a corruption, meaning those which do not fall under the culpability of sin, — for it is they indeed that the remarks relative to the present research concern, because, the passions of sin, we all profess to call them corruption, — I will make on this subject a brief exposition. Well, concerning any wound, or a blow or that which weakens, or again an alteration, a disease, whatever it may be, a destruction or a complete loss, such as one sees not only in the body of men, but also in that of beasts and plants and in seeds, I find the holy Scripture resorting to the invariable appellation of corruption or designating them by a word expressing destruction or alteration or loss. And concerning the corruption of sin, whose origin is the evil intention of man, it is superfluous to cite testimonies, because, on this subject, the profession of all is unanimous, as I have said above, and without any hesitation. It is however easy to show immediately, by the book of Genesis, that it is by this same word that the passion which resides in sin is thus named: "And God saw that the earth was corrupt, because all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth"<sup><a href="#fn505" id="ref505">505</a></sup>. And immediately, it is by the same name that he calls the judgment and the complete annihilation of all flesh by the flood. For he says: "Behold, I will destroy them with the earth"<sup><a href="#fn506" id="ref506">506</a></sup>. And to clarify what this is about, he added, continuing: "And behold, I will bring the flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die"<sup><a href="#fn507" id="ref507">507</a></sup>. Behold that likewise the punishment sent by God, who chastises for utility and brings death, to repress malice and to alleviate, for sinners, the torment in the age to come, he did not express it otherwise than by "corruption". And again, in the book of Exodus, concerning the plague of locusts, here is what is written: "Before there had been no such locusts, nor shall there be such after. And they covered the face of the earth, and the earth was wasted. And they devoured all the grass of the earth, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing on the trees, or in the herbs of the field, in all the land of Egypt"<sup><a href="#fn508" id="ref508">508</a></sup>. And the pain which is felt in the body because of excessive fatigue and weakness, and perhaps the death which results from it, the divine Scripture calls by the same name of corruption. For indeed, as Moses had applied himself an entire day to inquiries and judgments of the people and had appeased discords between the contestants, Jethro his father-in-law, seeing his excessive labor, said this: "The thing thou doest is not good. Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee; for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou canst not do it alone"<sup><a href="#fn509" id="ref509">509</a></sup>. And after having advised him to establish still other judges and to make them assessors in the hearing of cases, he says this: "And they shall bear the burden with thee"<sup><a href="#fn510" id="ref510">510</a></sup>. Who then is ignorant that it was for the profit of his soul that Moses, in the service of God, led the people, rendered his judgments and bore such a painful task? For what is more profitable for someone than to be in the service of God for the well-being of those whom he leads and judges, who enjoy his divine voice, the solicitude of his command and the diligence of the support he provides for them like a father? Nevertheless, this so painful task Scripture also calls corruption, and not simply corruption, but intolerable corruption! For it says: "Thou wilt surely wear away with intolerable weariness". Now Moses, the servant of God, welcomed the words of Jethro, he obeyed and put them into practice in his action.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I have made this known now, because Your Holiness, when it declared in an absolute manner: [JULIAN] "Where sufferings are not called corruption, nor even among the profane sages"<sup><a href="#fn511" id="ref511">511</a></sup>, it also added the following: [JULIAN] "Especially when the sufferings do not dominate the one who wants to suffer, but become remedies for those who suffer"<sup><a href="#fn512" id="ref512">512</a></sup>. Now, concerning the sufferings of Christ, the profane sages have never spoken a word, but they have always spoken of other men in the grip of sufferings. Judging (what happens) among men<sup><a href="#fn513" id="ref513">513</a></sup>, we find no others who have burned and been penetrated with divine love, who have suffered voluntarily for their personal well-being and amendment and that of their close ones, — without having been (for all that) dominated or vanquished or depressed by the sufferings, — to the same degree as the holy martyrs and, before them, the prophets and the patriarchs of whom one, and the most remarkable, was Moses. And the holy Scripture calls corruption the fatigue, and the weakness which must naturally result from it, of the body of him who was, in the service of God and in the solicitude for the members of his tribe, of such assiduity that the space of an entire day could not suffice him, although he was fatigued and had enjoyed no respite!</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But I return again to the peremptory word that Your Piety formulated: that sufferings are not called corruption. For behold that the holy Scripture calls corruption the bruises, cuts and bodily amputations, even in animals, in which, by reason of their irrational character, there is neither culpability nor responsibility resulting from sin, despite the symbols (inspired by the body) (of which) the book of the Law makes use to warn us to offer and consecrate to God, in sacrifice, our souls healthy and immaculate; as Paul also said, writing to the Romans, that we must "present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God"<sup><a href="#fn514" id="ref514">514</a></sup>. Thus therefore it is written in the Book of Leviticus: "(An animal) blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD. Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted"<sup><a href="#fn515" id="ref515">515</a></sup>. And (an animal with its) testicles bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, ye shall not offer unto the LORD; neither shall ye do thus in your land. They shall not be offered by the hand of a stranger, nor shall ye make an offering of any of these to your God, because there is a blemish in them<sup><a href="#fn516" id="ref516">516</a></sup>. The prophet Malachi made a similar declaration: "Ye bring that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD. But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing"<sup><a href="#fn517" id="ref517">517</a></sup>. The kinds of infirmities which afflict the body are also called in this manner. For he says in Deuteronomy, enumerating the threats which weigh upon those who transgress the Law: "The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish"<sup><a href="#fn518" id="ref518">518</a></sup>. And in the same book he called by the same term the decrepitude of old age, the wrinkles of the face and the dimming which strikes the sight; because indeed this suffering, common to old age, did not appear on the face of Moses until his death. He expresses himself thus: "And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated"<sup><a href="#fn519" id="ref519">519</a></sup>. And in other codices it says "And his face"<sup><a href="#fn520" id="ref520">520</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">In the book of Judges, the fact that the enemies reaped and cut down the fruits is called in the same manner: "And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them; And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass"<sup><a href="#fn521" id="ref521">521</a></sup>. And also concerning those who had fallen, killed in combat in a pitched battle, the same book of Judges resorts to the term "corruption": "And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men"<sup><a href="#fn522" id="ref522">522</a></sup>. And a little further: "And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the second day. And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men"<sup><a href="#fn523" id="ref523">523</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And David, the just man and prophet of God, who was harassed by Saul in an iniquitous manner, when he was preparing to shut himself up in the city of Keilah, said, it is written in the first book of Kings which is (the book of) Samuel, the following declaration: "Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant."<sup><a href="#fn524" id="ref524">524</a></sup> And again in the second book of Kings, according to the Greeks, which is by the same Samuel, here is what is written: "And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah"<sup><a href="#fn525" id="ref525">525</a></sup>. And further still, as Joab was struggling with the city of Abel and a wise woman had cried to him from the top of the wall that he should not destroy the entire city with its inhabitants, saying to him: "I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?" In response, Joab said: "Far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy."<sup><a href="#fn526" id="ref526">526</a></sup> Thus the total subjugation and annihilation of cities are called by the divine Scripture by the name of "corruption", and this does not signify, as Your Piety said, the beginning or the passage to corruption. And further still, in the same book, it is in the same manner, and not another, that the divine Scripture calls the pestilence sent by God upon the entire people, as correction and chastisement of the judgment which reaches sinners: "So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men. And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand."<sup><a href="#fn527" id="ref527">527</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">And again in the second book of Chronicles, concerning the massacre accomplished by a troop of enemy pillagers, it is written: "For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash. And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings."<sup><a href="#fn528" id="ref528">528</a></sup> And in the book of Job, we find that the withering of trees and their foliage is thus named to illustrate the loss of the impious and his vain works: "He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings. They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted."<sup><a href="#fn529" id="ref529">529</a></sup> "For the company of the hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit."<sup><a href="#fn530" id="ref530">530</a></sup> And the waning of the moon, when, after its full, the light which emanates from it diminishes, it is by the same term that it is expressed by Job who declares: "If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;"<sup><a href="#fn531" id="ref531">531</a></sup>. And in the prophet Isaiah, it is concerning the subjugation which results from a combat or a war that the following is written: "Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?"<sup><a href="#fn532" id="ref532">532</a></sup> (Context suggests a different verse, perhaps Isaiah 36:10: "And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it."). And in Jeremiah, it is said concerning the complete destruction and annihilation of Jerusalem: "Who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest? Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting."<sup><a href="#fn533" id="ref533">533</a></sup> And in the Lamentations of the same prophet, he wrote analogous things: "The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation."<sup><a href="#fn534" id="ref534">534</a></sup> And in the prophet Ezekiel it is written: "And I will give thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy. Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it."<sup><a href="#fn535" id="ref535">535</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">And in the prophet Daniel, concerning the three children who were not consumed in the midst of the furnace, but who blessed and glorified the God of the Universe, here is what king Nebuchadnezzar had said: "Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God."<sup><a href="#fn536" id="ref536">536</a></sup> Thus therefore the combustion and the lesion which results for those who are burned is called corruption! — This accident did not occur for the three children as a result of a miracle, the Son of God accomplishing the prodigy of descending with them into the furnace. It is he whom Nebuchadnezzar saw advancing fourth in the flame with the three (others) and who made him see it by opening his eyes and accomplishing such prodigies. (Also the king) added to what has been said and declared that the appearance of the fourth was like a son of God! — And yet it was for piety that they had delivered combat and it is voluntarily that they had fallen into the fire from which no one escapes; moreover, it was not recklessly, basing themselves on the hope of being in any case delivered, but solely for the good, the homage to be rendered to God and by love for him that they had accepted to be broken, to die and to contribute, by suffering, to their personal perfection and to that of all the servants of God, those of that time and also those who were to be until the last day of the subsistence of this world! For who has not been comforted in the combats for piety by their noble and energetic resolution? Or again, who would not be stirred to divine love by such words, grave upon the exploits of their combat and attesting, before the very trial of their bodies, the firmness of their admirable souls which stood up against the tyranny of the king? For they said: "Be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."<sup><a href="#fn537" id="ref537">537</a></sup> "If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."<sup><a href="#fn538" id="ref538">538</a></sup> And what is astonishing that the barbarian Nebuchadnezzar called 'corruption' what would have been a testimony of virility and piety, the putting into the fire of such heroes, in the case where really they would have been broken, there where Daniel himself, who distinguished himself in circumstances analogous to those, when he was shut in the lions' den, called corruption the bites and the action of devouring of these (animals) of which, by prodigy, he was not a victim? It is concerning this that he wrote this: "And they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee."<sup><a href="#fn539" id="ref539">539</a></sup> "Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God."<sup><a href="#fn540" id="ref540">540</a></sup> And when the same Daniel had mysteriously acceded to divine visions and that, saddened by this painful affliction, he subdued and subjected his body by painful works of penance, in one of the visions he wrote the following: "In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks. I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled."<sup><a href="#fn541" id="ref541">541</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">And after such penance, as a formidable and divine vision had appeared to him, he added this: "And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves. Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength."<sup><a href="#fn542" id="ref542">542</a></sup> He also called corruption this praiseworthy suffering, namely that of the alteration of his comeliness, that is to say of the appearance and the aspect of his body, the weakening and the lack of strength which had come (only) for the profit of him who had suffered and of all those who were to read his divine book and form the Church of our great God and Savior the Christ<sup><a href="#fn543" id="ref543">543</a></sup>. For this suffering also instructed clearly both the prophet himself and those who afterwards and until now hear it, that it does not belong to human power, even purified by penance, to receive visions of the mysteries of God, if he does not bring help and support to the weakness; that it is also necessary that in all manners be purified and formed to chastity those who are rendered worthy even if only to hear only, — I do not speak of seeing, moreover, like him, — such revelations!</p>

        <p class="paragraph">How therefore does all this agree with the definition of Your Piety which establishes peremptorily as a decree and declares that such sufferings are not called corruption? If I believe it good from then on to omit a quantity of testimonies on this subject, so as not to give to our exposition an unlimited extension, it seems to me however opportune and necessary, as much as it seems possible to me, to cite a single text drawn from the New Testament. For Paul who each day died for Christ, who loved him to this degree of intensity and ardor and who rushed for him into danger to the point of saying: "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"<sup><a href="#fn544" id="ref544">544</a></sup> and who, elsewhere, enumerated still in detail the following: "In labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness."<sup><a href="#fn545" id="ref545">545</a></sup> — called "the corruption of the outward man in him", that is to say of his body, all these sufferings so glorious, desired and ardently loved and which healed the entire Church. He said: "For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day."<sup><a href="#fn546" id="ref546">546</a></sup> It is in commenting on this passage that the wise John, bishop of Constantinople, in the Commentary on the first<sup><a href="#fn547" id="ref547">547</a></sup> epistle to the Corinthians, in the eighth homily, speaks thus: [CHRYSOSTOM] "We do not faint because of this, but, even if the outward man in us is corrupted, the inward man on the contrary is renewed day by day. How is he corrupted? When he is struck and suffers persecution, when he supports innumerable evils! On the contrary (the man) inward is renewed day by day by hope, by faith and the disposition of thoughts which makes us henceforth despise evils. For, the more numerous the evils that the body will undergo, the better is the hope that the soul acquires and the more it shines according to the image of the foundation of the world."</p>

        <p class="paragraph">If therefore the precious sufferings of the saints, the bodily wounds undergone for piety, the bruises and the evils of all kinds are in this manner clearly called by holy Scripture by the name of "corruption" or of "destruction", or by the word of "blemish", because it is in a corruptible, passible and mortal body that all this was endured, and (if) the eminent doctors who have explained it have used the same names and the same words, how shall I experience a superfluous fear and not call "corruption" the sufferings which occurred in the corruptible and earthly body of the blessed apostles, the prophets and the martyrs? For it is a great power which emanates from them and nothing which is contemptible. The great Paul also said it: "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us."<sup><a href="#fn548" id="ref548">548</a></sup> He who, from the corruption of the sufferings of the members which had been tortured in all manners and lacerated by torments, made rivers of incorruptibility and gifts of the Spirit and of healing spring forth; he who for this end became incarnate, without undergoing change, in a flesh consubstantial with ours and suffering like ours, and assured in all, without sin, the resemblance with us, so that in traversing all the irreprehensible sufferings of our death and our sepulture, he vanquished and destroyed their power and who, in taking truly in acts and in facts their violence, transmitted the victory to us also, as the first-born of our race; thus we could despise sufferings with force and brave death with courage and could hasten towards the incorruptibility and immortality of the resurrection, having before our eyes the first-born from among the dead<sup><a href="#fn549" id="ref549">549</a></sup>. It is for this that after having undergone persecution many times from the Jews, he said to the apostles and to the disciples: "If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you;"<sup><a href="#fn550" id="ref550">550</a></sup> And he who appeared before the iniquitous assembly of the priests and who was scourged before the governor Pilate, signified to them in advance that they would endure the same evils, saying: "But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles."<sup><a href="#fn551" id="ref551">551</a></sup> He who was covered with opprobrium and innumerable injuries, predicted in the same manner and teaches: "Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you."<sup><a href="#fn552" id="ref552">552</a></sup> And he who was struck and finally killed because of our iniquities and who underwent all that in the flesh because of us, enjoined us to show ourselves bold, saying: "And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul:"<sup><a href="#fn553" id="ref553">553</a></sup>, not that he realized in word and rendered easy all that as God only, but also as man, become consubstantial with us without undergoing change, suffering as we do in the flesh and resurrecting as chief in the struggle and the combats in favor of piety. And from then on he lowered himself to this total stripping so that in taking these traits which are ours and in dying our death in a passible and mortal body, he also resurrected there, becoming for us a road and a door towards the incorruptibility which flows from the resurrection. Let us not therefore experience terror at calling corruptible a body passible, mortal and subject to sufferings causing corruption, which are of a nature to strike, injure and bring prejudice to the flesh, but which are without sin and pure of all malicious culpability; in undergoing them by the resurrection, he changed it into incorruptibility! For it is this that we are taught to think and to say thus and to profess by these holy words of Cyril, in the Letter to Acacius, concerning the question of Azazel, writing the following: [CYRIL] + "The choir of the holy angels also, in their multitude, was struck with astonishment, when they saw in an aspect which is ours the king of glory and the Lord of hosts and they said: 'Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength?'<sup><a href="#fn554" id="ref554">554</a></sup> Now Bozrah is translated as flesh, or as tribulation or as oppression. And moreover they interrogated him: 'What are these wounds in thine hands?'<sup><a href="#fn555" id="ref555">555</a></sup>, and he said to them: 'Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends'<sup><a href="#fn556" id="ref556">556</a></sup>. For in the same manner as to the incredulous Thomas, in a manner entirely conforming to the economy, even after he was resurrected from the dead, he showed his hands and the places of the nails which were there, and he enjoined him to feel also the perforations which he had in his side<sup><a href="#fn557" id="ref557">557</a></sup>, thus also when he had ascended again to heaven, he persuaded the holy angels that it is with justice that Israel the beloved had been banished and rejected from his intimacy. To this end he showed his garment stained with blood and in his hands the wounds which subsisted there. For, by his resurrection from the dead he had stripped off corruption, and, with it, all that it entails; but it was, as I have said, so that, conforming to the economy, might now be shown to the Principalities and the Dominations which are in the heavens, by means of the Church, the infinitely varied wisdom of God, which he had prepared before the ages and realized in the Christ, as the divine Paul wrote to all<sup><a href="#fn558" id="ref558">558</a></sup>" <sup><a href="#fn559" id="ref559">559</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">These words are clearly said and they proclaim the truth in a lucid manner. We have from then on no need to comment on the content of the Letter to Succensus and the Treatise to the pious Theodosius, to undertake vainly a debate and to conjecture a meaning to attribute to them as one does for (texts) not known, whereas it was necessary to take him who speaks himself as interpreter of his words! For, as the Doctor said, once resurrected from the dead, he stripped off corruption, having henceforth no longer a passible body, but incorruptible and immortal and who is no longer subject to hunger, fatigue and the other sufferings naturally apt to corrupt, nor to the infirmities of the flesh, although, even after the incorruptibility deriving from the resurrection, he showed the places of the bruises, appeared affected by them and allowed them to be experienced by touch, — he said to Thomas: "Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side"<sup><a href="#fn560" id="ref560">560</a></sup>, — although he persuaded that he had truly suffered, whereas every incorruptible body excludes from itself the lesion of sufferings by the virtue of the resurrection, which we also await the realization of in our bodies! How would we blush at the truth, we who were its defenders? And shall we not confess that in the corruptible body, that is to say passible and mortal, he endured the sufferings and death for us? He had wanted to this extent to establish the truth that, even after the resurrection, the incorruptibility, the immortality and the impassibility, he appeared with the traces of the stigmata which are proper to the corruptible body! Such was the infinite greatness of the authentic and all merciful condescension of the economy that in this very thing he submitted himself, so to speak, to a measure still lower than ours, while excluding from his mystery all deceit and suspicion of illusion!</p>

    <p class="paragraph">And let the word of Saint Cyril intervene again in the debate, who, in the twelfth book of the Commentary on the Gospel of John, teaches us in a very spiritual and very complete manner this: [CYRIL] "Thomas touched the side of our Savior and he scrutinized the stigmata coming from the lance of the Roman, he saw the places of the nails<sup><a href="#fn561" id="ref561">561</a></sup>. Someone will perhaps say: How in an incorruptible body were signs of corruption perceived? For it is an indication of bodily corruption that there still existed in him, subsisting and visible, the perforation of the hands and the side and the appearance of the stigmata and of a wound effected by iron, whereas the truthful and irreproachable language about the body reformed for incorruptibility expresses the necessity of stripping off, with corruption itself, also the consequences which flow from it. Indeed, if someone is lame, will he return thus to life, still affected, in the foot and the leg, with lameness? And if someone has lost his eyes in this world, will he rise again deprived of sight? How, one will say then, shall we have rejected corruption, if the sufferings which result from it subsist and still dominate our bodies? I am assuredly not of the opinion that one must set aside the discussion on this point from the inquiry which is necessary for it; however we say this, — insofar as it is possible to speak of these difficulties which are proposed to us, — that at the time of the resurrection, no residue of the corruption which occurred is maintained in us, but, as the wise Paul says about this body: 'What is sown in weakness is raised in strength, what is sown in dishonor is raised in glory'<sup><a href="#fn562" id="ref562">562</a></sup>. Now, the expectation of the future resurrection of this body in strength and glory, what is it other than to return to its first constitution, after having rejected from itself all natural weakness and all dishonor flowing from corruption and sufferings? For it was not made for death and for corruption. Now because Thomas had formulated this request: in view of having a clearer assurance, it is necessarily that Our Lord Jesus Christ, to give no pretext to the smallness of our faith, also appeared to him in the very manner in which he wanted to see him; because also, when he ascended to the heavens and manifested the strength of the mystery which concerned him to the Powers on high, to the Principalities and the Dominations, to the chiefs of legions and to the presidents of the angelic orders, he was seen under this same appearance, so that they believed that the Word, who is from the Father and in the Father, had truly become man for us, and that they knew that he had the solicitude for his creatures to the point of first dying for us to secure life"<sup><a href="#fn563" id="ref563">563</a></sup>. Behold clearly that the Doctor has called bodily corruption: the stigmata coming from the perforation of the nails and the lance, for which there is no longer any place after the incorruptibility resulting from the resurrection, because we also, at the resurrection, will reject both the lameness of the feet and the blindness of the eyes, and from any member a vile, shameful lesion which disfigures and every corruption of this kind which penetrates and reaches the body, and we will assume integrity, the absence of sickness and health, which we possessed in paradise before losing the grace of immortality which he had given us in abundance from the beginning in creating us, so that we would not die as men, as the holy Scripture has said<sup><a href="#fn564" id="ref564">564</a></sup>, but that we would maintain ourselves in the incorruptibility in which we had also been created. He himself however, to confirm the truth of his death and of his sufferings which he had endured for us, even after the resurrection, he appeared to Thomas as well as to the reasonable spirits in heaven bearing the traces of the scars which are foreign to the resurrected body incorruptible, immortal and impassible, — as also the fact of taking food, — but which are proper to the corruptible, passible and mortal body.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">This is what the eminent Cyril still clearly teaches us who, in the same book, has written this: [CYRIL] "As after the resurrection, and especially that of the sacred body, the corruption absolutely no longer subsisted, since it was resurrected for incorruptibility, one also believes that it no longer had need, as before, of the usual food. He showed the places of the nails and did not refuse to take food, to confirm the great mystery of the resurrection and to implant its faith in our souls; now he accomplished these gestures which are absolutely foreign to the spiritual nature. For the places of the nails, the traces of the stigmata and the absorption of bodily food, from where and how to find them again in a spirit absolutely detached and not immersed in a body, given that it is the latter, as it befits the reason of its nature, which is inclined to present itself in these states? Also, to avoid that some believe that our Lord was resurrected as a subtle spirit or as an impalpable body, which would be like a shadow or aerial, — what some are accustomed to call spiritual, — but so that one believes that he had resurrected that very thing which had been sown in corruption, following the word of Paul<sup><a href="#fn565" id="ref565">565</a></sup>, he realized and showed what befits the density of the body"<sup><a href="#fn566" id="ref566">566</a></sup>. One must again understand how the doctor has clearly declared that after the resurrection he had dissipated what pertains to the corruption of the holy flesh, because he was resurrected for incorruptibility, and that, before the resurrection, he had experienced the need for food, inasmuch as he did not yet possess impassibility and immortality, in which incorruptibility consists. For it was fitting that it was in a flesh subject to sufferings and to death that Emmanuel endured true sufferings and died a true death, to destroy by the resurrection their power and their strength which weighed upon us.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">And behold what is astonishing! Paul compares the resurrection of our bodies to the seeds, namely to wheat and all the others, and he shows that, as they fall to earth, grow and surge up according to their nature, clothing themselves in brilliance and splendor as a result of growth, thus the bodies of those who believe in Christ are sown in corruption and surge up clothed with impassibility, immortality and the glory of the resurrection, — and it is for this very reason that he said: it is sown in corruption and it rises without corruption<sup><a href="#fn567" id="ref567">567</a></sup>; — exactly in the same manner also concerning the most holy body of our Lord, God and Savior the Christ, who came to death and to burial in the earth, Saint Cyril has declared: "That which was sown in corruption, following the word of Paul, one believes that it rises"<sup><a href="#fn568" id="ref568">568</a></sup>.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore he participated in the very modality of the experience of death as well as in the sowing in corruption, which is the burial of our bodies; but he did not remain in corruption and did not lower himself, like us, to the dissolution which follows burial. For his soul was not abandoned to Hades and his flesh did not see corruption<sup><a href="#fn569" id="ref569">569</a></sup> in the sepulcher, preventing by the resurrection the dissolution which results from this state. For Christ came to resurrect and also to resurrect us with him, we who had fallen, and not to remain in the tomb. Indeed, by the resurrection death was truly vanquished and it is for this motive that he became incarnate and made man, with the intention of becoming the first fruits for our resurrection. This is also what John, the holy bishop of Constantinople, in the Commentary on the first epistle to the Corinthians, says in these terms: [CHRYSOSTOM] "The first fruits are indeed the first fruits of something! Now how will he be the first fruits, if those of whom he is the first fruits do not rise? How therefore do they not rise? And if they do not rise, why was Christ resurrected? Why did he come? To what end did he take flesh if he was not to resurrect his flesh? For he did not experience the need for it himself, but it was for us"<sup><a href="#fn570" id="ref570">570</a></sup>. Furthermore that the word: "What is sown in corruption rises also without corruption"<sup><a href="#fn571" id="ref571">571</a></sup> alludes to the burial and to the resurrection of our bodies, the same Doctor signifies it to us in the same commentary on the letter, writing this: [CHRYSOSTOM] "And it is not our birth in the womb that he called here sowing, but indeed the burial in the earth, the decomposition of the bodies which have died, their reduction to ashes. That is why, after having said: 'what is sown in corruption', he added immediately: 'rises in incorruptibility'. 'What is sown in dishonor'; for what is more repugnant in its appearance than a putrefying corpse? 'Rises in glory; what is sown in weakness': indeed, thirty days are not passed that the whole has not perished and the flesh cannot preserve itself nor even suffice for a single day. 'Rises in strength': then, indeed, nothing will prevail over it"<sup><a href="#fn572" id="ref572">572</a></sup>.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">As for the places of the nails and the action of touching the body of our Lord posed, after the resurrection, by the apostle Thomas, as for the food which he took once resurrected from among the dead, the same things which were said by Saint Cyril, he also wrote them, in homily 87 of the Commentary on the gospel of John: [CHRYSOSTOM] "It is just to research how an incorruptible body exhibited the places of the nails and was palpated by a mortal hand. But do not be troubled: what was happening was the fact of condescension. For that which was subtle and light to the point of entering through closed doors was devoid of all density; but it is so that one would believe in his resurrection that he showed this and to teach that it was he who had been crucified and that it was not another who had risen in his place. It is for this that he rose bearing the signs of the crucifixion and it is for this very reason that he ate. And the apostles everywhere made it a sign of the resurrection saying: 'We have eaten and drunk with him'<sup><a href="#fn573" id="ref573">573</a></sup>. In the same manner therefore as when we saw him, before the resurrection, walking on the waves, we do not say this body is of another nature but of ours, thus also, after the resurrection, seeing him bearing the places of the nails, we do not say that he is henceforth corruptible. For it is for the disciples that he exhibited them"<sup><a href="#fn574" id="ref574">574</a></sup>. And a little further: [CHRYSOSTOM] "And after this he showed himself to the disciples near the sea of Tiberias<sup><a href="#fn575" id="ref575">575</a></sup>. You see that he did not remain with them continuously nor as before. He appeared therefore one evening and disappeared; and again eight days after, and again he disappeared; and after that near the sea and in the midst of a great fear. What does 'he showed himself' mean? It follows that he would not have been seen if he had not lowered himself to it, because his body was henceforth incorruptible and immortal"<sup><a href="#fn576" id="ref576">576</a></sup>. And still further: [CHRYSOSTOM] "As for the fact that he did not remain continuously nor as was customary, he said: 'It was the third time that Jesus appeared to them, resurrected from the dead'<sup><a href="#fn577" id="ref577">577</a></sup>. And he ordered to bring some fish, to make known that what one saw was not a phantasm; however here he does not say that he had eaten with them, but Luke, elsewhere, said: 'He ate with them'<sup><a href="#fn578" id="ref578">578</a></sup>. How? It does not belong to us to say; it was certainly in a marvelous manner that all this happened, not that the nature still had need of food, but it is by condescension, to confirm the resurrection"<sup><a href="#fn579" id="ref579">579</a></sup>.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">And Saint Epiphanius, to whom had fallen the archbishopric of the island of Cyprus, has left us, in the treatise called Ancoratus, a doctrine conforming to these ideas concerning the resurrection, in which doctrine one finds this: [EPIPHANIUS] "For it is the property of the impious to say that he absolutely did not rise, or again it is the act of those who believe wrongly to say that it is not that which had been and which had fallen asleep that was resurrected; but it belongs to the believers to say that it is this body itself which is resurrected and that it is from this very body that he resurrected that our body also has been placed in an authentic hope. It is for this that he left the places of the nails without destroying them as well as the place of the lance, although he had entered through closed doors. For his carnal body is resurrected spiritual; not other however than what he had taken off, but what he had been, when he was united to the divinity, was provided with the subtlety of the spirit. — For if it was not the subtlety of the spirit, what fissure would have given passage to the density of the body? — But he wanted to show that this same corruptible nature which is ours had truly recovered incorruptibility. For if it is mortal, it will put on immortality<sup><a href="#fn580" id="ref580">580</a></sup>. He entered through closed doors to show that what is dense was subtle, what is mortal was immortal and what is corruptible incorruptible; and to confound all those who do not believe in our redemption, I mean in our resurrection, he who had transformed the body into subtle matter and had penetrated the resurrection with spirit, did not efface the scars of the nails nor the place of the lance, but by what he had undergone on the cross, he showed that that which was resurrected was not other and that it is not another thing which issued from it, but that that very thing which had suffered had become impassible, that the grain which had fallen was resurrected<sup><a href="#fn581" id="ref581">581</a></sup> and that it was resurrected incorruptible. And so that moreover we do not believe that it was only a part which issued from it that was resurrected, it is that very thing, entirely, which did not see corruption, — he said indeed: 'You will not let your Holy One see corruption'<sup><a href="#fn582" id="ref582">582</a></sup>, — and on the other hand it is he himself entirely who is resurrected, — he said: 'He is risen, he is not here!'<sup><a href="#fn583" id="ref583">583</a></sup>. Now if he is risen and is not here, he is truly risen. And the Scriptures, which are our life, do not lie! And so that those who err do not find a pretext in it, he showed his bones and his flesh to Thomas and he said to his disciples: 'You see me; it is indeed I! A spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have'<sup><a href="#fn584" id="ref584">584</a></sup>. And if someone said insidiously that the body of Christ was of a superior condition, because it was conceived by Mary only, without the virile seed, then that of Adam also would have been other than that which is ours because it was drawn from the earth only and not from the virile seed! But no one can declare nor demonstrate such a thing! And if someone said again insidiously that it is only that one of Christ which is himself entirely resurrected, but that ours does not resurrect itself but that it is another than him, how does he say that Christ is resurrected, 'first fruits of those who have fallen asleep'<sup><a href="#fn585" id="ref585">585</a></sup>? Now if he is the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep, it is a unique and same body which is the first fruits of those who rise"<sup><a href="#fn586" id="ref586">586</a></sup>. Thus therefore the body of our God and Savior the Christ acquired the resurrection as the principle of incorruptibility, which consists in impassibility and immortality, and it is by this that he became the first fruits of our bodies.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">And also the text cited above by Your Piety, which is found in the book Ancoratus, was written, when one cites it integrally, concerning the incorruptibility which follows the resurrection. You, you have limited yourself to citing this: [JULIAN] "Altogether spiritual body, altogether incomprehensible divinity. That which suffered was not corrupted. The impassible is incorruptible. He is entirely incorruptibility the Lord God"<sup><a href="#fn587" id="ref587">587</a></sup>. Now the words which precede and those which follow those show clearly that it is concerning the incorruptibility and the immortality which follow the resurrection and the contact by which the spirit of Thomas was healed that the words were said which, in their entirety, are written in this manner: [EPIPHANIUS] "... but he enters, the door being closed, and he is palpated by Thomas, so that one does not seize a phantom but the truth, he in whom Thomas believed, after that was accomplished which had been said: 'I have sought God with my hands and I have not been deceived'<sup><a href="#fn588" id="ref588">588</a></sup>. The same, God, and, the same, man without realizing confusion, but combining the two elements into one, without being reduced to nothing, but strengthening with the help of the divinity the earthly body into a unique power. He is therefore one Our Lord Jesus-Christ; there are not two Christs nor two gods; altogether spiritual body, altogether incomprehensible divinity! That which suffered was not corrupted, the impassible is incorruptible; he is entirely incorruptibility the Lord God, who sits at the right hand of his Father"<sup><a href="#fn589" id="ref589">589</a></sup>.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Let us therefore no longer fear to follow all these apostolic and eminent doctors who, in the unique Holy Spirit, have explained the books which have been said by him; they teach to confess that, during all the time of the incarnation, the body of our Lord, God and Savior Jesus-Christ was corruptible, that is to say mortal and subject to irreprehensible sufferings, to death and to burial, so that, for having undergone them and being really dead in that which is naturally apt to suffer and to die, he fought again for our victory by destroying, by the resurrection, the power of the corruption which flows from sufferings and death. But after the resurrection he taught us to declare firmly the body incorruptible, that is to say impassible and immortal. Indeed, with all the others, Saint John also has clearly declared it, in what precedes, in this manner: [CHRYSOSTOM] "... because henceforth the body is impassible and immortal"<sup><a href="#fn590" id="ref590">590</a></sup>. But no one has declared his body immortal before that Emmanuel had borne the voluntary cross. For the negation of his death is repugnant to true redemption, because it leads to the impiety of the phantasiasts. Furthermore, that there existed from always in the body of our Lord to all and Savior the Christ the incorruptibility which consists in impeccability and in total holiness, it is what, with unanimous consent, have transmitted all those who initiate into the mysteries of the truth. It is likewise, as I believe, what has previously demonstrated in a complete manner the exposition and the demonstration that I have undertaken of what has been said, by resorting to the words of the doctors and of the Fathers which have been alleged concerning each of the points. It is by following them that I, the least, also in the Sermon on the holy Mother of God and always Virgin Mary, which I pronounced in the holy church of Antioch, have declared as in summary this: [SEVERUS] "By all this therefore the body of Christ is demonstrated incorruptible, he whose corruption of sin has in no way approached. As for that which results from death and sepulture, he would have been subject to it, but he destroyed it in himself and he was not held by it, by reason of his union with the Word who is, according to his nature, incorruptible, impassible and immortal"<sup><a href="#fn591" id="ref591">591</a></sup>. And it is in these words that is gathered all the exposition of the theory on this subject.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">But despite all that, in submitting to us this question with the sole intention of demonstrating that the body of our God and Savior Jesus-Christ is incorruptible, by impassibility and immortality, from before the resurrection, — for it is this which mattered to him,— Your Holiness detones the conversation on the incorruptibility resulting from impeccability and she writes what follows: [JULIAN] "For indeed as a woman was affected with an incurable flow of blood, by the contact of the fringe of the cloak of the Lord, she stole what she sought. And the Lord said: 'Someone has touched me', as the disciples said to him: 'It is the crowds who press upon you', he said again: 'Someone has touched me. For I know not that impurity has approached me, but 'that a power has gone out from me'<sup><a href="#fn592" id="ref592">592</a></sup>; I have given and not: I have received; I have acted and not: I have undergone. For, everything foreign, in approaching me, is corrupted from a distance, and if it is close to me, it is not added; for the fullness from which all have received<sup><a href="#fn593" id="ref593">593</a></sup> does not receive an addition. Now if corruption does not reach the fringe of the cloak, what will one say of the incorruptible body itself? For if it contracts corruption, one will say that it has submitted also to the movements of desire!"<sup><a href="#fn594" id="ref594">594</a></sup> But we will recall to your honorable Reverence, and opportunely on this point also: Why do you speak of impiety and of movements of desire, when no one contradicts this, that on the contrary all confess that the body of our God and Savior the Christ is holy and without sin, and by that itself always incorruptible, and distributor of holiness and of every kind of healing? And shall we esteem to do something great, if we believe to show pure of these stains he who gives and concedes in great abundance such advantages to his servants, because he is the source of all goods? For it is in the name of Jesus-Christ that the apostles and the disciples realized similar exploits. Thus it is written concerning Paul that the grace of Christ was to this point efficacious by his hands that if one applied cloths or linens which had touched his body on the sick, those were delivered from their illnesses and the evil spirits went away<sup><a href="#fn595" id="ref595">595</a></sup>. Who therefore would be impious to the point of saying that the cloak of our God and Savior the Christ was inferior to the garments which had touched the body of Paul and that the Master who operated should be placed in the second rank in relation to his servant who operated by him? But it is not for that either that we say that the body of Paul was impassible and immortal and that it was not subject to hunger, fatigue, torments, sufferings and blows; and we do not deny either, with regard to a health and to prodigies which befitted a God, that the body of Emmanuel, which was in everything like to us, except sin<sup><a href="#fn596" id="ref596">596</a></sup>, who is the Lord and the God of Paul, was suffering like ours and consubstantial with ours: it is in him that he was at grips with death and that he won a just victory over it for our advantage in rising from the dead. For if, from the incarnation, he had been incorruptible, that is to say impassible and immortal, no one being dead, what death would have been vanquished, as Saint Cyril has taught in the texts examined above? But we declare that it is in that which is naturally apt to be corrupted, yes, that it is in that that the operation of death was exercised, in that also that was realized the resurrection which followed death; that it is for this reason also that the Word of God united himself hypostatically, so that one believed that he himself had suffered there, had died there and resurrected, while he possessed, as God, the impassibility which suffering has not attained.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">What then does the facundity of Your Holiness pretend which declares: [JULIAN] "If corruption does not reach the fringe of the cloak, what will be said of the incorruptible body itself?"<sup><a href="#fn597" id="ref597">597</a></sup> Indeed, what kind of incorruptibility do you declare to have affected the fringe of the cloak of our Savior Christ? If you speak of that which (consists) in holiness, there is no one who contests your words, but we confess that He is holiness and that He grants to those who approach Him the help of healing, since elsewhere again, in the holy Gospel, it is written: "They brought to him all who were sick, and begged him that they might only touch the fringe of his cloak; and all who touched it were healed"<sup><a href="#fn598" id="ref598">598</a></sup>. However, this is not what the controversial question submitted to us concerns, since Saint Athanasius, in the statements which, earlier, fell under the investigation concerning the all-holy flesh of the universal Creator, God and Savior, Christ, taught us this: [ATHANASIUS] "Therefore, it would have been much more fitting to admire that the Word was in a flesh thus passible and that He did not prevent those who were torturing Him nor take vengeance on those who had killed it, although He could have, He who had prevented others from dying and had raised from the dead those who were dead, but that He had consented that His body should suffer. For it is for this that He had also come, as I have said, so that He might suffer in the flesh and that henceforth the flesh might be constituted impassible and immortal"<sup><a href="#fn599" id="ref599">599</a></sup>. For who is deaf to the words of the Gospel to the point of not knowing clearly that Our Lord, when the time of voluntary sufferings presented itself, declared, indicating that it was to suffer that He had become incarnate and made man: "What shall I say? Father, save me from this hour! But for this reason I have come to this hour!"<sup><a href="#fn600" id="ref600">600</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">If on the contrary it is because of the incorruptibility (consisting in) impassibility and immortality that you declared that the fringe of the cloak was incorruptible, insofar as it neither ages nor wears out over time or that it is dissimilar and does not suffer the same accidents as our garments, which of the evangelists or apostles has written this? And among the eminent doctors, which one has taught that the garments of our Savior were impassible and immortal? For, concerning His seamless tunic, woven in one piece from top to bottom, the wise John the Evangelist writes<sup><a href="#fn601" id="ref601">601</a></sup> that the Romans who had crucified Him did not tear it, but cast lots for it; as for the other garments, they divided them among themselves, while the prophecy pronounced as if emanating from the person of Christ was fulfilled: "They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots"<sup><a href="#fn602" id="ref602">602</a></sup>. Now the tunic designates at the same time allegorically the unfissured concord of the Church, which is the body of our Savior Christ and, so to speak, His cloak and His garment, following what Paul said to the Ephesians: "We are members of his body"<sup><a href="#fn603" id="ref603">603</a></sup> and because also each one of us is said to have put on his body as a garment, according to what Job also wisely declared somewhere to the God of the Universe: "You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews"<sup><a href="#fn604" id="ref604">604</a></sup>. As for the impassibility and immortality of the garments as well as their incorruptibility as one conceives of them, absolutely no one has said or taught (anything) about it. And to the sons of Israel who had abandoned the cult of the Egyptian idols, who constantly wanted to return to Egypt and were complaining and grumbling, as it is written<sup><a href="#fn605" id="ref605">605</a></sup>, who nourished puerile and petty thoughts and [were obsessed] by the thought of the Egyptian meat pots, Christ, who had led them into the desert, gave and granted them similar advantages and He lowered Himself as to little children, saying: "Your clothing did not wear out on you, and your foot did not swell these forty years"<sup><a href="#fn606" id="ref606">606</a></sup>, and "Know then in your heart that, as a man disciplines his son, so the Lord your God disciplines you"<sup><a href="#fn607" id="ref607">607</a></sup>, and again: "Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandal has not come off your foot"<sup><a href="#fn608" id="ref608">608</a></sup>, so that, by the very garments, their heart, which had forgotten His miracles, might be put to shame. And when He became incarnate and, excluding all change and all appearance, He became truly man, He shared with us not only our nature, but also our way of life, our concerns and our ways. It is for this that Paul also said: "He was made in the likeness of men and being found in appearance as a man"<sup><a href="#fn609" id="ref609">609</a></sup>. And in every way His goal was this: to take upon Himself our contemptible character, since, when He was in the form of God, He humbled and lowered Himself<sup><a href="#fn610" id="ref610">610</a></sup> and took the form of a servant<sup><a href="#fn611" id="ref611">611</a></sup>, without wishing to astonish us either by the greatness of the body or by the adornment of unwearable garments; on the contrary, He resorted to all that suited lowliness and, by His acts, He showed that He had been in all things like us, except for sin<sup><a href="#fn612" id="ref612">612</a></sup> and that He had presented Himself to us as a rule of life and a norm of wisdom. This is what also John, Bishop of Constantinople, taught in this manner in the Commentary on the epistle to the Ephesians: [CHRYSOSTOM] "But He appeared as a man, not by astonishing us with exploits, but by exhorting us to humility. When therefore He said concerning Himself: 'as a man'<sup><a href="#fn613" id="ref613">613</a></sup>, it is this that He signifies, since elsewhere again He calls Him man, when He says: 'For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus'<sup><a href="#fn614" id="ref614">614</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn615" id="ref615">615</a></sup>. And again in the Commentary on the gospel of Matthew, concerning the fact that our Lord sat on a donkey, he said: [CHRYSOSTOM] "For my part, it does not seem to me that it was only for this that He sat on a donkey, but also to provide us with a norm of wisdom. For He did not limit Himself to fulfilling the prophecy and implanting the teachings of the truth, but He also fixed a line for our conduct, by establishing everywhere by these gestures the rules of necessary usages and by giving in all things a direction to our life. It is for this that, when He was about to be born, He did not seek a glorious dwelling nor a wealthy mother, but a poor one whose husband was a worker, that He was born in a cave and was laid in a manger; and in the choice of His disciples, He did not take orators and sages or the rich and descendants of a noble race, but poor descendants of the poor and unknown on all sides. And when He prepared the table, sometimes He placed pieces of barley bread on it and sometimes He commanded the disciples to buy according to the opportunity. And when He took a meal, He did so with herbs. He wore coarse garments and not different (from those) of the masses"<sup><a href="#fn616" id="ref616">616</a></sup>.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore, whereas the proposed question was to know if it is by impassibility and immortality that the body of our Lord, God and Savior, Christ, had been impassible even before the resurrection, how has Your Holiness brought, to prove it, the incorruptibility, impassibility and immortality of the cloak, since no one, as we have said<sup><a href="#fn617" id="ref617">617</a></sup>, has said or written that the garments of our God and Savior, Jesus, were impassible and immortal? For, if it had been so, the thing would have been signaled by the witnesses and ministers of the Word, as they have also written down the other things. And even though those things which have not been written down, and which the world would not suffice to contain, surpass those which are written in the gospel, — for this John the Evangelist has declared to us<sup><a href="#fn618" id="ref618">618</a></sup>, — we must nevertheless not make any dangerous conjecture in the domain of what is not written: from that moment I could fear that those who delight in innovations and are capable of nothing other than saying or hearing something new, considering that Christ has been treated, by this kind of profane persons who rob Him of His voluntary stripping, in conformity with His divinity, they might start declaring that one must say that His garments also were impassible and immortal! It is fitting therefore that we spare the innocent and simple souls and that we do not offer pretexts to those who wish to trouble them.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore I pray Your Holiness not to imitate the disputers, but to keep with her the *Tome* that she sent me and not to communicate it to anyone. For I have discovered in it still other (ideas) which attack the sublime doctrines and which have similarly offended me. Moreover, as I said above<sup><a href="#fn619" id="ref619">619</a></sup>, I did not want to leave anything unexamined; but seeing our exposition taking on excessive extension, I have omitted the examination and discussion which concerned them. For the vocabulary which relates to the teachings of the faith abounds indeed in multiple subtleties and we must fear and dread very strongly letting ourselves be easily carried away to write on these matters, unless a necessity presents itself, which we cannot avoid, which constrains us to it. It is that Your Piety must also be persuaded that even what I have written, I have composed with sadness, considering that my silence would have fallen under the blow of the divine laws if I had not done what you had asked of me, and that without saying anything which came from me, but by alleging only that which emanated from the doctors of the holy Church.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Pray however, you who are animated in all things by the love of God, that our weakness may resist with promptitude and firmness those who persecute us because of the Faith, that we may attain a happy end and that we may find at least a modest salvation from our many sins on the terrible and dreadful day of judgment.</p>
