    <h1>Against the Impious Grammarian<br>First Oration</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph subheading">VOLUME ONE OF THE BOOK OF SAINT MAR SEVERUS, PATRIARCH OF ANTIOCH, AGAINST THE GRAMMARIAN</p>
        <p class="paragraph">A book written by Saint Severus, patriarch and archbishop of Antioch, to him who had reported the things which were impiously and abominably uttered by the blasphemous Grammarian; which book he began indeed while he was still in that same city, but completed after he had withdrawn from it because of the persecution which arose against the Church on account of the true faith.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">FIRST ORATION</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER ONE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>Praise of him who reported the hidden booklet of impiety; and that it is not without reward to burn with zeal for God concerning such things.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">The souls of men who love God surely need to be greatly and profoundly saddened and to grieve, for the sake of lofty and supreme glory, when they hear of some who are arrogant and raise their blasphemous mouth to heaven, speaking iniquity on high, while with their tongue they go about on earth and crawl upon it and roll about in vain. For what way is there for those who utter his words? That one is the father of lies and the inventor and head of sin, concerning whom the Lord decreed, saying: "Upon your breast and upon your belly you shall go, and earth you shall eat all the days of your life."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fn1-ref">1</a></sup> Therefore, it is impossible for the divine decree to be changed, even if "the dragon, the head of malice, transforms himself into an angel of light," as Paul said;<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fn2-ref">2</a></sup> and even if, as it is written concerning him, puffing himself up he says: "I will ascend into heaven and above the stars of God I will set my throne,"<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fn3-ref">3</a></sup> in vain indeed does he swell up and perhaps terrify only those who do not trust in the Lord, but he does not depart from the earth; upon it he goes, in it he dwells, it he eats. So therefore also the sons of this serpent, imitating the blasphemy hostile to God and the malice of their father, are themselves nothing other than serpents and by the divine word are called by this name: "serpents, offspring of vipers!"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fn4-ref">4</a></sup>, and He adds concerning a certain one, saying: "How can you speak good things, when you are evil?"<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fn5-ref">5</a></sup> They often dare to involve themselves in theological matters under the guise of piety and to build upon the spiritual rock, which is Christ.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fn6-ref">6</a></sup> But when they fall from its lightness and incomprehensibility—for such is the truth—and through scales, that is, through the wicked graspings of their blasphemies, they can hold nothing in it, neither bent nor hollow, or, to speak generally, nothing twisted can they grasp in it, they slip back to earth; for the word of justice is not treadable by them, which is equal and simple on all sides. Nevertheless, even when they are below, they wish to be considered as walking upon the rock and, being fraudulent in words, they pretend to speak divine things, while intermingling their own lies with the truth persuasively, to hide it, casting their poison upon those who are sound. To this I think refers what was said allegorically by the author of the book of Proverbs and which wisely illustrates the simple conduct of the children of piety: "We cannot know the ways of the serpent upon the rock."<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fn7-ref">7</a></sup> But by saying "we cannot," and again thus applying the persona of those who have most recently come and are being instructed in the introductory disciplines to the proverbs, he indicated that it is not impossible for this to be understood by those who have the mind of Christ from the inspired teaching of Paul,<sup><a href="#fn8" id="fn8-ref">8</a></sup> and they can say concerning the apostate dragon and those who are generated from him: "For we are not ignorant of his thoughts."<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fn9-ref">9</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What wonder, then, if you, who have been educated in divine Scriptures and have separated your life to God and have applied yourself to principal and necessary things, and meditate on the things that are above, seeking where Christ is, to be wise in the things that are above, not the things on earth, when you took that unclean booklet into your hands, you recognized those deceitful and serpentine ways, which indeed pretend to elevate themselves to the rock, because they are thought to say that the Lord Jesus Christ is one and not two, but immediately they divide this eminent person of piety by a duplicity of natures, and cast those who through them, being led astray, have been persuaded not to walk firmly, into the great cult of man? Concerning whom you said that you also grieved and therefore the pain of this blasphemy against God was doubled for you, and zeal consumes your heart and you say those things which were indeed sung prophetically through David, but were brought to effect in Christ and set forth for us an example in similar circumstances: "Zeal for your house has consumed me, and the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen upon me."<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fn10-ref">10</a></sup> For every soul that fears God acknowledges Him who created it; rightly does it turn to itself and considers insults against God and contumelies against the Church, which is the house of God founded upon the confession of orthodoxy and in faith, to be its own; on account of this faith the most eminent of the apostles was declared blessed and was called the rock.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Great indeed is the reward of zeal written in the heavens, especially since you also brought and urged that unlearned and impious booklet to Our Humility, to draw forth against it "the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,"<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fn11-ref">11</a></sup> "destroying counsels and every height lifting itself up against the knowledge of God."<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fn12-ref">12</a></sup> Wherefore I believe you will also bring upon yourself the blessing of the Levites, who armed their hands against those who acted impiously in the desert and "changed the glory of God into the likeness of an ox that eats grass,"<sup><a href="#fn13" id="fn13-ref">13</a></sup> as David the prophet said, mocking their folly. What is the blessing? That certainly which Moses cried out to them, saying thus: "You have filled your hands today to the Lord, that a blessing may be given upon you!"<sup><a href="#fn14" id="fn14-ref">14</a></sup> And so also to you, O little one changing the saying, we shall aptly say: "You have filled your tongue today to the Lord"; we shall add also "and your hand," which gave us through the pen a sign of the fight for the glory of God, "that a blessing may be given upon you."</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TWO</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That we must diligently and fully resolve the things which are written in any way against the word of truth, without investigating who or of what sort he is who wrote the impiety.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Now, these things having been said and written by me, you clearly know that I profess myself to be greatly indebted to you for gratitude. I indeed wished immediately to refute the impious volume and, as it is written, to lay my hand upon the form of the asp, to explore the den of the sons of serpents and to reveal their caverns, and thus to walk upon them and crush their head, through the power of Him who said to the apostles and to those who through them believed in Him: "Behold, I have given you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall harm you."<sup><a href="#fn15" id="fn15-ref">15</a></sup> This same thing indeed He promised most abundantly also to little ones and those still needing milk through the prophecy of Isaiah, saying these things: "A little child shall put his hand into the hole of the asp and upon the den of the sons of asps, and they shall not harm, nor shall he be able to destroy even one on my holy mountain; because the earth is filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as many waters covering the seas."<sup><a href="#fn16" id="fn16-ref">16</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But what would I have done, when I was lying among very many ecclesiastical affairs, which also aroused fear and thence did not even allow me to breathe, and again when, in those days, my ears were stunned by the tumult of the people, and I myself often alone received the onset made thence, because some from their own malice were preparing disturbances of all kinds for this great and most Christ-loving city?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Since now, by the grace of Him who gave peace by saying: "My peace I give to you,"<sup><a href="#fn17" id="fn17-ref">17</a></sup> the constitution of the city has returned to quiet, the disturbance of the people having been calmed, and we are drawn from one side only, that is, from the cares of the Church, and are not, as it is said, "born in the sea" we are oppressed on both sides, eagerly, as you see, seizing the opportunity offered to us, we meet your urging, and standing upon the holy mountain of truth, we do not fear those sentences and voices which come inspiring and creeping upon the earth. For we trust in Him who said. Would not the prophet, if we invoked such things for aid, with sentences added, also say: "Is not the people to its God? Why do they seek from the dead?"<sup><a href="#fn18" id="fn18-ref">18</a></sup> For He gave the law for aid, so that they might say: "Not according to this word"? Indeed we also, "a chosen race and a holy nation," as Peter said,<sup><a href="#fn19" id="fn19-ref">19</a></sup> and before him Moses,<sup><a href="#fn20" id="fn20-ref">20</a></sup> nay He who appeared to him, we look only to Christ our God, who is also invoked upon us, and we do not inquire about these dead and weak and human things from the words of the Spirit; for thus somewhere also Stephen, the chief and first of the ministers, speaking to the Jews about Moses, says: "Who received living words to give them to us."<sup><a href="#fn21" id="fn21-ref">21</a></sup> This, then, the prophet says, making a reproof under the figure of a question: "Is not the people to its God?" that is: does not the people of God approach its God? He therefore who consults the dead concerning the living, where God gave the law for aid, so that they who received it and obey it and are made partakers of aid from Him, may also say: "Not according to this word"? For all these the word and spirit of the divine and efficacious law surpass, because also "the word of God is living and efficacious and more penetrating than any two-edged sword."<sup><a href="#fn22" id="fn22-ref">22</a></sup> Did not the disciples therefore receive this great promise: "Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate beforehand how you will answer. For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to resist or contradict"?<sup><a href="#fn23" id="fn23-ref">23</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">When therefore I, too, though small, place all my hope in this invincible aid, let those things which were said to the apostles and to those who after them obtained the name and reality of doctrine and stood courageously in the holy Church, be brought forward: which indeed bear witness to those things which are rightly disposed, but reject those things which have been introduced by the adversary from abroad, many times from his own heart, not from the mouth of the Lord, as a certain one of the prophets said.<sup><a href="#fn24" id="fn24-ref">24</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER THREE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That it is the custom of heretics to feign causes and to assume the persona of one defending himself.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And first indeed he weaves, as it were a prologue, to certain monks leading an immaterial life and by no means involving themselves in the affairs of those who converse in the world. For the Grammarian thinks that those who lead the same life and profess to meditate in the law of God need the art and teaching of his own subtlety. Secondly, however, he says that he, as if suffering persecution on account of piety, fears the threats of those who persecute him. And to these monks, who are fabricated through a false writing, I shall say what Elias the Tishbite used to say to the Israelites,<sup><a href="#fn25" id="fn25-ref">25</a></sup> who had withdrawn from the service of God so that they even deified a fly and approached it to seek some oracle and some revelation: "Is it because there is no God or prophet in Israel that you go to inquire of Beelzebub, the god of Ekron?"<sup><a href="#fn26" id="fn26-ref">26</a></sup> "So therefore, as Paul said,<sup><a href="#fn27" id="fn27-ref">27</a></sup> is there not among you even one wise man" who can discern what is the truth of the faith, so that he can repel a foreign doctrine, but you need a grammarian as an assistant or as an interpreter of doctrines?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But concerning that which, pretending a cause, he says he fears and trembles at threats and writes in fear—and this he repeats most wickedly throughout the whole book, being weakened by convicted and suppressed and puffed up with the audacity of blasphemy—what shall we say, except this: These machinations and simulations are familiar to heretics, and they always diligently care to attribute to themselves the parts of one fleeing, so that with a lowered appearance they may attract the hearer. What therefore does he also say? THE GRAMMARIAN: "Most audaciously do the sons of heretics, whom even now we fear to call by name, attack us, who are filled with such audacity, not so much against us as against the orthodox faith." Does not Saint Basil thus refute Eunomius feigning fear in such trifles? EUNOMIUS: "Moreover, lest you be offended at us in any way, if neglecting indeed weakness and fear, preferring indeed grace and present security confidence in future things, and more than all earthly vexation and temporal death, we consider the threats intended for the impious to be feared, we write the truth stripped of every veil."<sup><a href="#fn28" id="fn28-ref">28</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">In the same way this distinguished one also feigns that he fears the threats intended not so much for himself as for the orthodox faith; for this thought he manifestly feigns. For thus also Eunomius said that, having spurned fear and temporal death and other things besides these enumerated, he writes the truth manifestly without any veil, and declares that the threats intended by God for the impious are especially to be feared.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do you grieve, therefore, O hearers, with him who transfers the threats intended for the faith to himself and wishes to fight for it as much as he can? Set forth, therefore, O excellent one, set forth the threats, and you will find many hearers who will grieve with you.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER FOUR</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That without writing and without demonstration concerning us, who confess the one nature of God the Word incarnate, he has lied, as if we confound and reduce into one substance the flesh and the divinity.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">"The holy synod of Chalcedon," says the Grammarian, "they diligently anathematize, so that they bring into the midst of the altar for us, as Eutyches and those who emulate his opinions, and, without a veil, making the divinity and flesh of Christ as one substance and one nature, they preach. For they are not ashamed, opposing Gregory the Thaumaturge saying in the eleventh anathema: 'If anyone says that the flesh of Christ is consubstantial with the divinity, and has not confessed that He who is God before the ages in the form of God emptied Himself and assumed the form of a servant, as it is written, when He was incarnate, let him be anathema.'<sup><a href="#fn29" id="fn29-ref">29</a></sup> But neither do they fear Athanasius, the star of the city of the Alexandrians; for similar things to these words of the Thaumaturge he also said, writing these things in the epistle to Epictetus: [ATHANASIUS]: 'What kind of infernal being has dared to say that the body born from Mary is consubstantial with the divinity of the Word, or that the Word was changed into flesh and bones and hair and into the whole body?'<sup><a href="#fn30" id="fn30-ref">30</a></sup>"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">O what an accusation, how astute, how inevitable, and fortified with the testimonies of the Fathers! Can you say, therefore, O Grammarian—for your whole discourse looks to me, as you have confessed in many places of the booklet—that I have declared in the very words that the body assumed from Mary the Virgin Theotokos, animated by a rational soul, hypostatically united to the Word Himself, is consubstantial with God the Word? For "I have not been placed in a hidden place, nor in a dark place of the earth,"<sup><a href="#fn31" id="fn31-ref">31</a></sup> as Isaiah the prophet said elsewhere, that is, He who was speaking in him, reproaching the unlearned audacity and blindness to evident things. Place here and show what you have found of your accusation against me. I assume for you associates of your accusation as judges; for judges indeed are those who with love of truth meet the things which have been fabricated by you against us. Is it time for me to say to you those things which Jacob said to Laban: "What is my transgression and what is my sin, that you have pursued me, and that you have searched all the vessels of my house? What have you found from all the vessels of your house? Place here before your brethren and before my brethren, and let them judge between us."<sup><a href="#fn32" id="fn32-ref">32</a></sup> For the vessels of your house are these, but certainly alien from my house: namely, to say that the holy body assumed from Mary is consubstantial with God the Word, and to say that the immutable and uncreated divinity of the Only-begotten was changed into flesh, or again the flesh was changed into the substance of the divinity. Show that the oriental synod of venerable bishops wrote that these things are communicated, although they wrote often and to many, especially to the holy synod of Egypt and to the evangelical throne of the church of the Alexandrians, which is the head of them. Consider only how everywhere they have both explicitly rejected from the divine incarnation both commingling, and mixture, and change, and confusion of substances, and on the contrary division and separation, and have decreed anathema against those who think thus, and indeed with the whole mind and whole mouth. But these very things the venerable synod of Egypt also to the oriental synod not once and again only, but also very often both wrote in the very words and received writings, and from both sides Christ the Word of God was concordantly proclaimed as truly incarnate and made man<sup><a href="#fn33" id="fn33-ref">33</a></sup> in flesh consubstantial with us, animated by a rational soul, and like us in all things except sin, so that He is the same, consubstantial indeed with the Father and the Holy Spirit according to divinity, but consubstantial with us according to humanity, having been made and being and never ceasing to be—for He will come again clothed with a body—with God-worthy and sublime glory, He who before and before the ages was without body, who is one Son, one Lord Jesus Christ, one person, one hypostasis, one nature of God the Word incarnate, and thus He will judge the world in justice and will be seen by those who pierced Him, as holy Scripture cries out.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Is it possible, then, that this opinion, and that they wrote thus in the synodical letters, as the whole earth under heaven testifies—for they disseminated everywhere the things which were written—has escaped you alone? "For this was not done in a corner," Paul was saying to the leader Agrippa.<sup><a href="#fn34" id="fn34-ref">34</a></sup> But you think that because they anathematize the synod of Chalcedon, they follow the wicked and impious opinions of Eutyches, or attribute the same substance to the body taken from Mary and to God the Word, whose own through the incarnation became a body homogeneous and consubstantial with us, and thus they sacrilegiously bring such unclean things into the holy penetralia and to the altars. But they speak against you; they gravely rebuke the vainly insolent as similar to those things which were often written by them.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do not seek, therefore, as the divine Athanasius, what infernal being has belched forth such unclean and blasphemous things, but look into yourself, if you wish, and you will manifestly see that your own throat has belched these things upon us; and read that word which falls upon you, written by David saying: "Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully; judge them, O God."<sup><a href="#fn35" id="fn35-ref">35</a></sup> For how would you not be guilty of the judgment of God, who wrote this accusation against two holy synods, without adding any argument—for you had nothing to say—but immediately fled and, having left the persona of the accuser, as you are accustomed to play with the reasons of your art, modestly you again assumed the persona of one fleeing, after you had indeed hastened to accusation like a lizard, but had put on the cunning of a fox. For you said, turning yourself to this audacious and furtive commutation: THE GRAMMARIAN: "But now is not the time for arguing their impious doctrines. I think it will be sufficient for me if I become a defender of those things which are rightly disposed and were said by the holy Fathers who convened at Chalcedon."<sup><a href="#fn36" id="fn36-ref">36</a></sup> If therefore you came forward to become a defender and to construct a defense, you ought from the beginning to undertake the defense and by no means to begin from an accusation lacking argument and cunningly to desist from it, and somewhere near the end of the booklet again to prepare that accusation with that fraud which is fitting for you, but whose snares no one, unless he is an animal utterly deprived of intellect, is caught.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER FIVE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>First, indeed, the accusation dismissed without argument; then, confirmed by him, a manifest confutation, in which it is shown that this man calumniates us as saying one nature, that is, hypostasis, as one substance, and he himself through blasphemy calls a mixture a composition without change made from two things of diverse substance into one hypostasis.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For he thinks that I am subject to the reproofs of confusion and mixture of substances by him, from certain brief excerpts from the things which I wrote to the infamous Nephalius. But I shall immediately and separately transcribe the very verse which was violently torn by him from the connected discourse, so that all who come upon it may know; that passage, even thus considered, is far removed from accusation. For while I was speaking about the constitution of man, I said: "It is one nature, soul and body."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">How, therefore, would he who was thinking of confusion according to substance, confess that it is one nature? For if from confusion they have passed into one and simple thing, how will they appear in one? For the demonstrative is of a composition, unfused in singularity, that is, in one hypostasis, by no means of a simple thing.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Of such sort is man like us, one nature and hypostasis from soul and body. CYRIL: "For 'one' is truly said not only of those things which are simple according to nature, but also of those which are gathered according to composition: as man himself is a certain thing from soul and body. For those things are diverse according to species, and by no means consubstantial with each other; but when they are united, they accomplish one nature of man, although in the reason of composition the natural difference of those things which are brought to unity is present."<sup><a href="#fn37" id="fn37-ref">37</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Are these not the words of Saint Cyril, which you bring forth with your mouth as if through delusion, so that you may be considered as thinking rightly, but in mind by no means? For unless you wickedly think "one according to nature and hypostasis" is the same as "one substance," you would not undeservedly stain those who confess rightly, while you transfer that composition without change, arising from confusion, into simple.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER SIX</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That Saint Cyril also with the same doctrines and concordant words rejected the vain calumny of those who, acting the part of Jews, were accusing him of constitution.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For it was of great concern to the heretics then, as also to you now, to convert the one nature proclaimed by the orthodox into equality of substance, as if to twist what is rightly disposed, asserting that even Saint Cyril, who shares the calumny with me, and he manifestly rejects it. For in the oration concerning that Christ is one, when he had first introduced another persona, namely that persona of him to whom he was speaking and with whom he was disputing, he thus said: CYRIL: "B. Are they therefore confused with each other and made one nature? — A. But who is so stupid and unlearned as to think either that the divine nature of the Word was changed into that which it was not, or that the flesh was transferred according to the mode of change into the nature of the Word itself? By no means can this be done; we say therefore that the Son is one and his nature one, even if He is acknowledged to have been made in the assumption of flesh having a rational soul. For His, as I said, the humanity was made; but He is conceived by us in no other way than as God and man at the same time."<sup><a href="#fn38" id="fn38-ref">38</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Behold, Saint Cyril said that Christ Himself is one nature, understanding "nature" not, according to you and the insistence of the impious, one and simple, which is the same according to substance, but one hypostasis, which arises from an unfused composition of those things which are not consubstantial with each other. Will you therefore here also, taking away a verse from the connected discourse of the sentences which follow and precede it and are found in the whole apparatus of the discourse, calumniate the wise Doctor and indeed confess that he said: "We say therefore that the Son is one and his nature one," but will you turn his very words into a crime against him and his authority, and say that he also wrote when sending according to the epistle to Succensus: CYRIL: "For if, after we said 'one nature of the Word,' we had remained silent, not adding 'incarnate,' perhaps the discourse itself, and indeed not inept, would be for them to question similarly: Where is the perfection of humanity, or how does the substance like us subsist?"<sup><a href="#fn39" id="fn39-ref">39</a></sup> Why, therefore, will you say, did he now remain silent concerning "incarnate," and placed the bare sentence: "We say therefore that the Son is one and his nature one," without adding "incarnate"? But the words which precede and which follow in the excerpted place repel your calumny and do not close the impudent and unlearned mouth, in which he rejected and removed change and confessed the assumption of flesh animated by a rational soul. For he also added: CYRIL: "even if He is acknowledged to have been made in the assumption of flesh having a rational soul. For His, as I said, the humanity was made," after he had previously removed the suspicion of change, and had said in the preceding: "But who is so stupid and unlearned as to think either that the divine nature of the Word was changed into that which it was not, or that the flesh was transferred according to the mode of change into the nature of the Word itself? By no means can this be done."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">If therefore we hear God and our Lord Jesus saying in the Gospel: "Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment,"<sup><a href="#fn40" id="fn40-ref">40</a></sup> let us also consider the sentences which follow my verse and the place thus terminated. For in the things which I wrote to Nephalius, I placed the passage of Athanasius which is found in the book of the conversation of Anthony, the chief of monastic life and true philosophy, composed in the manner of a narrative, where he relates his wrestling with the Calumniator and the consequent victory; and he says thus: ATHANASIUS: "For he who thought himself to be like God was deluded by a youth, and he who gloried against flesh and blood was conquered by a man bearing flesh. For the Lord helped him, who for us bore flesh and gave victory to the body against the Calumniator."<sup><a href="#fn41" id="fn41-ref">41</a></sup> Afterwards I added these words of Saint Athanasius: "Behold how both concerning man like us and concerning the Lord, Athanasius could speak. For as we, who are said to be, are one thing, one nature, soul and body, by no means another and another, in the same way also the Lord Himself with His own flesh, clearly animated by a rational soul, without change became also one."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Why have you taken away these things and transcribed one verse dissected? Are you just and do you rejoice in the truth and are you zealous for the faith? For when you hear that the Lord without change became one with His own flesh, and from an ineffable concurrence into unity one nature and hypostasis is accomplished, you pursue with the reproof of change those who do not confess change; and you are not ashamed to understand Him as one according to nature on account of the singularity according to hypostasis, who is composed unfusedly from things diverse according to substance, as if He had suffered confusion. But when the passage which precedes the verse, violently excerpted and calumniating the unlearned, is also adjoined, it cries out the audacity of violence and manifestly shows the truth. For it is thus: "For as we, who are said to be, are one thing, one nature, soul and body." For to the word "we" the context of the discourse consequently refers, having itself thus: "we, that is, every man, are one thing; we are one nature, soul and body." But having removed the words "one thing we are," you have separately read the words "one nature, soul and body"; and when you saw that from the cutting off indeed you were gaining an advantage—for the very word refuted the calumny of confusion—you brought the name "nature" to the name "substance," and you interpreted that "according to nature, that is, according to hypostasis one," as said as "same and connatural and homogeneous substance!"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">You ought indeed to consider also that: namely, if I had affected the example of man with confusion and had said that through change of soul and body there is one substance and nature by equality of substance, I would not immediately have joined to the discourse about Christ and written: "without change He became one with His own flesh," from which I had changed the example and affected it with confusion. For I would have acted unwittingly in the same way as one who had constructed a certain machine for storming walls, but after he constructed it, when he ought to apply it and use it to shake the walls and work elaborately for the purpose and effect for which it was constructed and diligently prepared, this indeed he does not do, but rather strengthens the walls themselves and the machine itself blocks every approach.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">To what end, therefore, do you labor in vain, O good man, who when you hear from us proclaimed that the ineffable union of God the Word with humanity is immutable, you bring forward the accusation of change, and in your unlearned booklet you ask me, saying: THE GRAMMARIAN: "Who of the teachers of the Church taught you these things, O man? Cyril? Or does he deliver such things and write to presbyters, deacons and fathers of monks: namely, that the Virgin Mary is the God-bearer, just as also the soul of man is generated with its own body and is considered as one something with it, although it is understood and is according to its own reason diverse in nature from it?"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But hear the same Cyril saying—unless you can hear his doctrines only in part—that the soul and body of man, although according to nature they are understood and are diverse from each other, accomplish one nature through congregation among themselves and the union of natural immutable concurrence. For he wrote in the epistle to Valerian: CYRIL: "For one nature and constitution of man is proclaimed."<sup><a href="#fn42" id="fn42-ref">42</a></sup> Say therefore also to him, struck with the insanity of unlearning and pricking me in vain: THE GRAMMARIAN: "If you say that the soul of man is understood and is diverse according to nature from its own body, how is there one nature and constitution of man? And are you not ashamed to place the soul and body as the same?"<sup><a href="#fn43" id="fn43-ref">43</a></sup> For these things have been manifestly uttered by you also against us. But Cyril meets you, saying, and indeed very easily: "Insane one, do you think you are hidden while you wickedly or unlearnedly reduce the name of nature to the name of substance and understand one nature, that is, hypostasis, as one and the same substance? For where I said that the soul of man is diverse according to nature from its own body, I proclaimed that each is neither connatural nor consubstantial. But where I said: 'For one nature and constitution of man is proclaimed,'<sup><a href="#fn44" id="fn44-ref">44</a></sup> I signified that from immutable congregation and natural union one nature and hypostasis is accomplished. Or have you not heard me, when I wrote to Succensus and said: [CYRIL]: 'For those things are diverse according to their species, and by no means consubstantial with each other; but when they are united, they accomplish one nature of man, although in the reason of composition the natural difference of those things which are brought to unity is present.'<sup><a href="#fn45" id="fn45-ref">45</a></sup> But that when we confess that one nature is also accomplished, soul and body concurring into natural union for one animal hypostasis, we by no means speak of equality of substance and confusion, but one hypostasis from both together, the things which were written to Valerian show thus: CYRIL: 'For one nature and constitution of man is proclaimed, although it is conceived from diverse and according to their species differing things. For body is certainly diverse according to nature, if compared to soul; nevertheless it is its own and together with it perfects the hypostasis of one man.'<sup><a href="#fn46" id="fn46-ref">46</a></sup>"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, when you hear that one nature is accomplished, soul and body concurring into one through natural congregation, rightly understand that one hypostasis is indicated. For hear the wise Doctor, who said that its own body is proper to the soul and together with it perfects one hypostasis of one man. But do not, by twisting what is rightly disposed into a perverse understanding, accuse that one nature is said as one substance, as if those things which are diverse according to their species and by no means consubstantial with each other, from which union is made, were confused into equality of substance; nor impudently rebuke, audaciously and unlearnedly turning the discourse to me and saying: THE GRAMMARIAN: "Are you not ashamed to say that we are flesh-bearers, but to place the same substance of soul and body?"<sup><a href="#fn47" id="fn47-ref">47</a></sup> Where have you hidden yourself, sought by those who judge rightly, to demonstrate your accusation with the very words? Explain where in my words I have placed the substance of soul and body as the same. Show to the judges that the understanding of the things which I said agrees with the understanding of your accusation, so that they may pronounce sentence for you. But you cannot speak, unless perhaps, as you are accustomed, you lie; and again you are convicted of lying.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER SEVEN</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>What machination, having declined from proof of the accusation from the beginning, he glued it on at the end.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, when you began, in this excellent booklet, you were vehemently with great pride reproving us as sinning against the laws of Gregory the Thaumaturge and the great Athanasius, because the former indeed said: [GREGORY]: "If anyone says that the flesh of Christ is consubstantial with the divinity, let him be anathema,"<sup><a href="#fn48" id="fn48-ref">48</a></sup> and the latter again said: [ATHANASIUS]: "What infernal being has dared to say that the body born from Mary is consubstantial with the divinity of the Word, or that the Word was changed into flesh and bones and hair and into the whole body?"<sup><a href="#fn49" id="fn49-ref">49</a></sup> But because you could not show that I ever said that the body assumed from Mary the God-bearer is consubstantial with God the Word, or that God the Word was converted into flesh, you fixed the stern, as it is said, and desisted from the accusation, saying: THE GRAMMATICIAN: "But now is not the time for arguing their impious doctrines."<sup><a href="#fn50" id="fn50-ref">50</a></sup> Fearing to join his calumny and to compose it with the words of the holy Fathers, lest considered together they would bring great shame upon you. For if they indeed reject these things, namely that it is impiously said that the body assumed from the holy Virgin is consubstantial with God the Word, and likewise that God the Word underwent change into flesh; but the accusation shows that we have nowhere said any such thing: what else are you going to do but cause great laughter at yourself, when the paternal laws show your calumny to be vain, and none of those things which they abominate is in it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Which calumny, although you astutely distinguished it, I subjoined to the laws of the Fathers, so that they might refute it at close quarters and say directly: "Show that he who is reproved has spoken those things which we abominate; show that he has said that the body is consubstantial with God the Word; convict him of having anywhere written that God the Word was transferred and changed, and the incorporeal nature was converted into body. But if you cannot show, you rather sin against us, by no means he who is undeservedly accused. Perhaps, however, you foolishly thought us to be assistants as witnesses and favorers of falsehood, and forgetful of the divine words, of which we are interpreters, saying: 'A false witness shall not be unpunished; but he who kindles malice shall perish by it.'<sup><a href="#fn51" id="fn51-ref">51</a></sup> And the ministers indeed of the Holy Spirit, Gregory and Athanasius and their laws, because of your calumny rise up against your head, and these cry out all the day and will cry out at all time in the future."</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER EIGHT</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>A manifest confutation of the accusation appended at the end, showing the falsification and audacious calumny which he foolishly and vainly fabricates against many genuine statements.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But you do not cease "to kindle malice"<sup><a href="#fn52" id="fn52-ref">52</a></sup> against divine words, and you place vanity upon vanity, as the divine Job said in a certain place,<sup><a href="#fn53" id="fn53-ref">53</a></sup> and you revolve ineptly in the same lies. For again concerning me you say these things: THE GRAMMARIAN: "But I attend also to the interpreter of impiety. For he did not cavil such things with pride in vain; but as he says that the substance of soul and body is one, so he asserts that the Lord with His own flesh became one thing, clearly one according to substance, and by no means according to person, as is manifest from the passage appended from him."<sup><a href="#fn54" id="fn54-ref">54</a></sup> It would be opportune for someone to say to this distinguished one, who wrote these things, that which was appended by one of the prophets: "O city of bloods, wholly lying and full of impiety."<sup><a href="#fn55" id="fn55-ref">55</a></sup> For as we have manifestly shown: that which I said, namely that the substance of soul and body is one—and this indeed he could not show to be placed in my words, but only that there is held the one nature and hypostasis of man consisting of soul and body—he wickedly changes into "one and the same according to substance," so now also he says that by me, according to the example of this confusion, it has been added that the Lord Himself in the same way became one thing with His own flesh, after he removed from the midst the voice "without change," and suppressed the voice "clearly animated by a rational soul"; and after the impudent theft and cutting off, he divines concerning me to the hearers: "he says that the Lord became clearly one according to substance, and by no means according to person."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Excellent, as it seems, interpreter of my mind I have obtained, who by cutting off and removing voices and changing significations, and explanations of the senses of words, has woven! But the things which have been written by me are thus; I shall again append them integrally for enlightening those who come upon them, and for the confutation of detraction and of the strong adversary, although they have been placed above: "Behold how both concerning man like us and concerning the Lord, Athanasius could speak. For as we, who are said to be, are one thing, and one nature, soul and body, by no means another and another: in the same way also the Lord Himself became one thing without change with His own flesh, clearly animated by a rational soul."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">When this wonderful one was reproving these things, he stole the words "without change" and suppressed the words "clearly animated by a rational soul," and, as I said before, he divines concerning me, feigning himself an interpreter of my mind and asserts that I have said the Lord became one, not according to person and hypostasis, but through confusion and change according to substance. With what condemnation, therefore, would that good man not be struck, if even in a judgment disputing about a certain matter, he had stolen or cut off a word from the writings and things submitted for examination? Would not both his hands and his very tongue be cut off? But because it concerns divine doctrines, and concerning the faith, than which nothing is higher for those knowing and loving the truth, he dared to do this very thing, not by men has the sentence of condemnation been pronounced against him, but we commit it to Him who said: "Vengeance is mine, and I will repay."<sup><a href="#fn56" id="fn56-ref">56</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Worthy of wonder is how, as the wise Paul said,<sup><a href="#fn57" id="fn57-ref">57</a></sup> the intellects of the unbelievers are darkened with darkness. For he has become insane in this matter to such an extent that he even stole words and committed the deed of falsifiers, perhaps only shaken by this among words, by that excerpt which he thought he was refuted by, stolen and cut off, he omitted adulterately those things which in this very discourse written by me to Nephalius are contained and fully repel his calumny. For I appended the passage of the epistle of Saint Cyril to the monks—to recall a few from many, while I pursue that which is perfect, namely the demonstration of truth together with brevity—in which these things are contained. CYRIL: "For it is proper, as I said, that the Word of God and His Only-begotten is from the substance of God and the Father. But because He assumed flesh and made it His own and is called Son of Man and was made like us, I think it is by no means absurd, but necessarily to be confessed that He according to the flesh is born through a woman, just as also the soul of man itself is generated together with its own body and is considered as one something with it, although it is understood and is according to its own reason diverse in nature from it. And if anyone wishes to say that the mother of someone is flesh-bearing, but not at the same time also soul-bearing, he utters entirely vain words. For the generated being, as I said, a living being harmoniously composed from dissimilar things, and indeed consisting from two but one true man, while each remains that which it is, but those two concur into natural unity and have mixed, as it were, with each other that which each had as its own."<sup><a href="#fn58" id="fn58-ref">58</a></sup> To these, after I had thus appended, I added thus: "You see that he has delivered that from two He is to be understood as one, when he compared the incarnation of our Savior to the constitution of man, and did not permit division into two, but preserved union without confusion, saying 'while each remains that which it is, but those two concur into natural unity.'"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">When therefore these words of the wise Cyril—which if anyone calls a balance of dogmas, he will not sin—are appended in the discourse to Nephalius, and are thus rightly understood by me, as the things which have been transcribed and which you have also now heard show, with closed eyes, that is, with a mind heavy with the stone of heretical stupidity, overwhelmed, this wise and prudent man, having dismissed these things, brings forward the same to me as if to an ignorant person, saying: THE GRAMMARIAN: “Who among the teachers of the Church taught you these things, O man? Cyril? Yet he teaches such things, writing to presbyters and deacons and fathers of monks: namely, that the Virgin Mary is the God-bearer, ‘just as also the soul of man is generated with its own body and is considered as one something with it, although it is understood and is diverse in nature from it according to its own reason.’ How therefore, after you have neglected to examine such things, do you transfer us to another way, namely of perdition, not knowing the fathers and the common notions, and are you not at all ashamed to say that we are flesh-bearers, but to place the same substance of soul and body!”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">To you again and to the vanity of your insane and superfluous accusation it is necessary to say these words of Job: “There is no savor in your words, because even tasteless bread will be eaten; for indeed the mind approves words, but the throat tastes food.”<sup><a href="#fn59" id="fn59-ref">59</a></sup> Not only has your mind, O good man, never rationally savored or approved, but with the greatest madness you act to eat tasteless bread. For the words of Saint Cyril which we adduce, these very words, and indeed not understanding them, you ignorantly bring against us as if they were opposed. After I had shown the right sense of the institutions and doctrines of this wise teacher, I said: “You see that he has delivered that from two He is to be understood as one, when he compared the incarnation of our Savior to the constitution of every man, and did not permit division into two, but preserved union without confusion, saying: ‘while each remains that which it is, but those two concur into natural unity.’” And with audacity and ignorance you revile, saying against me: THE GRAMMARIAN: “Are you not ashamed to say that we are flesh-bearers, but to place the same substance of soul and body, and that there is no difference between them!”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Alas! Do you not think that difference is indicated and at the same time the separation which you proclaim is removed by these words: “remains indeed each of them that which it is; but they concur into natural unity”? Consider therefore whom it is fitting to fear and be ashamed: whether you, who lie about such evident things and are opposed by written and reproving arguments, or us, who with many arguments are shown free from your accusation? But because you have the face of a harlot, as Jeremiah said, and have acted impudently in all things,<sup><a href="#fn60" id="fn60-ref">60</a></sup> and remain in the same, you say about me: THE GRAMMARIAN: “This man does not abandon one substance, but disturbs and confounds all things, and is wholly a dog, and has lost the rational soul,” and again: “We shall say to him, borrowing words from the prophetic voice: ‘This man is foolish, and not at all prudent?’”<sup><a href="#fn61" id="fn61-ref">61</a></sup> — indeed to bring reproach upon you we use sentence and apostolic words; we are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are not prudent in Christ,<sup><a href="#fn62" id="fn62-ref">62</a></sup> who do not hear Him saying: “When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own.”<sup><a href="#fn63" id="fn63-ref">63</a></sup> For how is it not proper to you, that which is held as altogether your own in words, as has already been shown? But the wise, according to the Paroemiast, do not turn away from the heart of the Lord; but what is considered the mouth of the Lord if not the truth, in which of old He spoke in many parts and in many ways in the prophets, but in the last days He has spoken<sup><a href="#fn64" id="fn64-ref">64</a></sup> in truth and through truth, not indeed in another as in the former type? Wherefore He also said: “I who speak, am here,”<sup><a href="#fn65" id="fn65-ref">65</a></sup> and: “I am the truth.”<sup><a href="#fn66" id="fn66-ref">66</a></sup> But as for the audacity which many times revolves and casts away discipline, and is not ashamed, nor considers into what way these words lead it and to what end they turn it — for, as it is written, “the impious man stands with a bold face; but he who is upright understands his ways”<sup><a href="#fn67" id="fn67-ref">67</a></sup> — again we will place and pour upon you other sayings,<sup><a href="#fn68" id="fn68-ref">68</a></sup> which strongly restrain your calumny against us, although you have neglected and deservedly despised them, because you did not want the truth to appear.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For indeed, in the oration to Nephalius, besides that from which you strove to construct your accusation and false writing, it is contained in these very words: “But adhering without adulteration to the doctrines of the God-bearing Fathers, by the grace of God we are in good opinion and stand upon the rock, confessing God the Word to have been incarnate from the holy God-bearer ever-virgin Mary and from the Holy Spirit, with flesh consubstantial with us animated by a rational and intelligent soul: for the Virgin is consubstantial with us, from whom the Holy Spirit formed this holy body; for it was not from human seed, etc. So we confess the same consubstantial with the Father according to divinity, and the same consubstantial with us according to the incarnation: we say the same, not another and another; for the things from which our Savior is are different and different, not another and another. For from two natures we believe Him to be one, that is, from perfect divinity and from perfect, without sin, humanity, without change, without confusion, no confusion or mixture having been made, as we said above.”<sup><a href="#fn69" id="fn69-ref">69</a></sup> And again after a little: “If anyone says from heaven that the flesh of the Lord descended, or passed through the Virgin as through a channel, but does not say that it was formed from her according to the law of conception, though without a man, let him be anathema. For neither the conception, nor the birth from Mary, nor the conversation with men, nor the cross, nor the burial, nor the resurrection from the dead, nor the ascension into heaven happened according to fantasy, but all according to truth: for we who truly sinned needed true healing. Therefore we also expect Christ to come according to truth, in this very body in which He endured the saving passion of the cross; for thus He will be seen by those who pierced Him.”<sup><a href="#fn70" id="fn70-ref">70</a></sup> For we do not hold theopaschism thus said, etc., but we say, as it is written, that the Lord of glory suffered in the flesh.<sup><a href="#fn71" id="fn71-ref">71</a></sup> For whatever is proper to the body suffers, yet the impassible Word was united to the body capable of suffering; and because the body is His own, His also is said to be the passion. But neither without soul nor without mind, but we believe the incarnation of the Lord to be animated and endowed with mind and intellect. For we anathematize the fantasy of Eutyches and Valentinus and the impiety of the Manichaeans and the madness of Apollinarius and the evil division of the economy of Nestorius.”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">These things were written in the oration to Nephalius; against them you raised an accusation; but you did not oppose your ignorant booklet to them; you presume to teach him who said these things so fully and with such words, that the body assumed from the Virgin is not consubstantial with God the Word. Nor do you perceive, O Grammarian, that you are teaching Minerva?<sup><a href="#fn72" id="fn72-ref">72</a></sup> or those who, like dogs, explain the volumes of Homer: “I teach something new,” Phaidimus or Hippodemus or Polynices; nay, if I may say something of my own, by despising mythological things you teach Israelites, though you are a foreigner, to say in prayer: “Adonai Lord, Elohim Sabaoth,” or you teach the apostles to work signs and virtues in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">However, because you seem to have read a letter written by me to Maron — for you indicated this in your immense booklet, in which you recalled a passage placed in it, which the preceding oration will consider in its time — I will take a few words from it and place them here, and show manifestly to the hearers that you, with many refuting your calumny, have scattered wisdom,<sup><a href="#fn73" id="fn73-ref">73</a></sup> and have said in your mind that which the prophetic word says about those who act with audacious impiety: “The Lord has forsaken, He does not regard the earth.”<sup><a href="#fn74" id="fn74-ref">74</a></sup> But to these a certain wise man advises, saying thus: “Do not say: I shall be hidden from the Lord, and from the heights who will remember me?”<sup><a href="#fn75" id="fn75-ref">75</a></sup> “He who is diminished in heart thinks these things, and a man without understanding devises this cause.”<sup><a href="#fn76" id="fn76-ref">76</a></sup> Hear therefore this and understand, when you were unwilling to understand, thus you wholly delivered yourself so that you rush into calumny and, as Jeremiah the prophet says, you are taken in your own will.<sup><a href="#fn77" id="fn77-ref">77</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">I wrote therefore to Maron, about the constitution of every man these things: “As the soul of man is perfect according to its own reason — for it did not assume a body for completion — so also after its separation from the body, it appears in its own hypostasis. For we ought to believe Paul indeed speaking about the souls of the just: ‘The spirits of just men made perfect’<sup><a href="#fn78" id="fn78-ref">78</a></sup> and ‘the church of the firstborn, who are enrolled in heaven.’<sup><a href="#fn79" id="fn79-ref">79</a></sup> But Peter, who wrote about those who were in sins: ‘In which also coming He preached to the spirits that were in prison: which had been disobedient formerly, when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being built.’<sup><a href="#fn80" id="fn80-ref">80</a></sup> If therefore the soul, to which an incorporeal nature belongs, is believed to be part of the constitution of man according to nature, and indeed while it is perfectly as soul and in no way suffers confusion, which arises from mixture: how, when we hear that God the Word is hypostatically united to flesh, shall we be burdened and call that an impossible thing, pretending causes of this sort? For man also, whom we call man, consists of soul and body. He is perfect indeed as man, but is part of the whole creation, and has nothing perfect by nature except God alone.<sup><a href="#fn81" id="fn81-ref">81</a></sup> But He who is perfect in all things deigned without change to become part of the creation, without leaving anything or diminishing His perfection, but has integrity in Himself and remains above creation. And this again Saint Cyril manifestly teaches in the epistle to the monks, which begins: ‘Zeal and diligence’;<sup><a href="#fn82" id="fn82-ref">82</a></sup> for he wrote thus: CYRIL: “For if being God He became man, He did not cease to be God; if He became part of the creation, He remained above creation; if being lawgiver as God, He was made under the law, and is still lawgiver; and being Lord according to divinity, He accepted the form of a servant, and did not lay aside the dignity by which He is Lord: if being the Only-begotten, He became the firstborn among many brethren:<sup><a href="#fn83" id="fn83-ref">83</a></sup> and is the Only-begotten: what wonder, if the humanity suffered in the flesh, the impassible life is thus understood divinely?”<sup><a href="#fn84" id="fn84-ref">84</a></sup> If however you say it is an insult that the Perfect should become part of the creation, you have the opportunity of time to despise the whole skill of the economy, by which He made all things His own and gave me of His splendor and by the very things made known the extinction having perfection and in humiliation height.”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">O, when you read these things thus, if you had understood, and not through malice or ignorance neglected, in your marvelous booklet you would in vain, as if contending with a shadow, nor, like the insane, while you strike the air with fists, think that men being beaten are struck by you, nor would you ridiculously compose syllogisms about those things which are certain to all the wise, nor would you say:</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER NINE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That one nature is said, not only of substance, which in generic signification comprehends many hypostases, but also of one person and one hypostasis even from things diverse in species and not consubstantial, composed without confusion into one.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">THE GRAMMARIAN: “For not because the inner and outer man is one, therefore soul and body are of the same substance; but we know the singularity of person, even against your will, yet we dare not say that the soul and the body are the same substance.” And again: “For if body and soul are of the same substance, but the definition of consubstantial things is the same, and the body is corruptible: therefore the soul also is corruptible, and to say the soul immortal appears false.”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">O subtle and most wise inventions of the mind! O soul learned, according to the Paroemiast,<sup><a href="#fn85" id="fn85-ref">85</a></sup> in cunning speeches, from which there is no escape! I would gladly ask your wisdom whether after long vigils you brought forth these for me, or in a moment of time you emitted such acute […]? For the whole world would have been in error, unless you knew that the human body is corruptible, but the soul immortal. But because we know this through you, we also know without you that by the concurrence and union of soul and body one nature and hypostasis is accomplished, not the equality of substance, which is destroyed, as you thought, the difference of those things which are gathered into one.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And with suitable testimonies placed above, Saint Cyril again comes forward into the midst and at the same time teaches that which from an unfused composition is in singularity, is both one person and one hypostasis and one nature equally said. For when he himself had said, in the eighth chapter or anathema, that it should not be said that the man who was assumed is co-adored and co-glorified with God the Word, but rather that Emmanuel is to be honored with one adoration, as one Lord and God and Son and Christ,<sup><a href="#fn86" id="fn86-ref">86</a></sup> the impious Andreas rebuked him and said: “Behold you wrote that the Son sits with His Father with His flesh: but the preposition ‘with’ does not differ from the preposition ‘with’.”<sup><a href="#fn87" id="fn87-ref">87</a></sup> But he defends himself against this, saying: CYRIL: “Therefore let us refute them because they have ignored the force of the sayings, and have not considered the nature of things. For when concerning one person and nature and one hypostasis, considering the things from which it is or is constituted naturally, he adds the preposition ‘with’ or ‘with’, he preserves even thus that which is one according to composition and does not define it separately into two. But when hypostases are first divided into two and for this, that each should be conceived singly and separately, the preposition ‘with’ or ‘with’ is said, then we say the signification is made of two or many, not at all of one according to composition. For example, if perhaps I say that the soul is co-honored with its own body if any honor is made by someone towards one man, who is from both; or if anyone says that the soul is one man with its own body, he in no way defines this one man into two men; but rather seems not to be ignorant of those things from which man is or is composed naturally. When however I say: Peter and John are called men together, or: With Peter also John was going up into the temple, now the preposition ‘with’ or ‘with’ does not make the signification of one certain thing. For Peter is not composed with John, nor do both come together into the constitution of one man. Why therefore do they machinate against the truth and ignorantly divide one into two Christs?”<sup><a href="#fn88" id="fn88-ref">88</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">These things manifestly signify that Emmanuel, since He is ineffably and unfusedly compacted from divinity and humanity, which are perfect, into one, is conceived and said to be one hypostasis, one nature and one person; just as also every man, Peter or John, composed of soul and body, is one person and one nature and one hypostasis; and he who does not confess this, according to the word of the God-bearing doctor which we just heard, machinates against the truth and ignorantly divides one into two Christs. How therefore are you not ashamed, who turn worn and by all proclaimed things to the distortion of truth? And perhaps you think you are speaking to youths who are instructed by you, and you turn upon yourself the instances of youths and solve those things which are not bound but are placed by you as if through fiction of implication and binding. For what adversary do you introduce responding and asking you: “How do you say the humanity is one nature?”; but you respond to him as if bringing forth from hiding a certain secret and ineffable word, unknown to those who walk upon the earth, that you call one nature according to the common notion of any substance, indicating the whole human race.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But know, O most wise and sagacious of grammarians, that one nature is also called the hypostasis of a certain one, as in the sentences just placed Saint Cyril declared, who more than you and not as you knew the signification of nature: for it indicates now genus, then species, as the very name of humanity also shows. For indeed, when we hear the book of Psalms saying: “Man, his days are as grass,”<sup><a href="#fn89" id="fn89-ref">89</a></sup> we understand the whole human race to be signified by this name: for the word extends over all nature, which like grass flourishes and immediately withers. But in another psalm when the psalmist says: “Behold the man who did not make God his helper, but trusted in the abundance of his riches,”<sup><a href="#fn90" id="fn90-ref">90</a></sup> we look to one hypostasis of a certain one: for now the name “man” is indicative of one person: for he extends the word to one evil and impious man, namely to Doeg the Idumean or Syrus, to whom also the title of the psalm is held. Indicative of particular signification, not generic, is also that which is written by Luke about him whose hand was withered thus: “And looking round about upon them all, He said to the man, Stretch forth your hand.”<sup><a href="#fn91" id="fn91-ref">91</a></sup> And in the Acts Agrippa says about Paul: “This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.”<sup><a href="#fn92" id="fn92-ref">92</a></sup> It is long and altogether indecent to gather many such manifest things from divine Scripture. Thus therefore the very name of nature is significative now of genus, now of species.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TEN</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That, when one composite nature or hypostasis is spoken of, it indicates the things from which this one nature is constituted without change.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And indeed concerning this matter, all these things have been said: for there is no need to say more to the prudent. But that also it is often said about a composite into one something, which is effected without confusion and without division, gathered, again Cyril testifies, who is a perfect and wise teacher in all things. For he wrote in the Scholia thus: CYRIL: “In the Song of Songs our Lord Jesus Christ is introduced to us, saying: ‘I am the flower of the field and the lily of the valleys.’<sup><a href="#fn93" id="fn93-ref">93</a></sup> Just as therefore odor is an incorporeal thing, but uses, as its own body, that in which it is; yet one from both is understood as the lily, but the reason of its departure altogether corrupts the one — for the odor is in the subject and the subject is the body — and concerning Christ we cease to understand: the odor of His divinity also, more excellent than the world, sweetly smells in the world in His humanity, as in a subject; and that which is incorporeal according to nature, according to the economical union has become, so to speak, corporeal, because He wished to be known through the body: for in it He worked the things that befit God. Rightly therefore is understood that which is incorporeal in its own body, just as also in the flower the truth of the odor is understood as in a subject; but the lily is thus said?”<sup><a href="#fn94" id="fn94-ref">94</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Desist therefore from such vain and foolish loquacity, knowing that thus by us is proclaimed one nature of God the Word incarnate and one person and one hypostasis, as every man Peter or John is proclaimed. For I recall the words of Saint Cyril: that from rational soul and body one person and one hypostasis and nature is composed. Nor understand one nature according to generic signification in the underlying formula: for you hear one hypostasis and person as one. Nor again foolishly think that one nature and hypostasis is the same as one substance, when you know that without change through the natural congregation of soul and body one man is reckoned.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That in the manner of the former heretics, who divided one Christ in Jewish fashion, this man also calumniously brings against us the crime of change and confusion.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">If indeed, even after you have learned these things, you still bring against us the crime of mixture on account of the affinity of the natures from which the one Christ is, indicate the affinity and audacity of the accusation. Thus also Theodoret, your father and leader of the Chalcedonian synod, because he persisted in the same vain accusations and reprehended mixture up and down as an accusation, heard from the wise Cyril in the defense of the fourth anathema these things, which I also say to you, not untimely, which are thus: CYRIL: “But I am so far from saying that the natures were mingled with each other and suffered mixture and confusion and conversion, as you rightly think.”<sup><a href="#fn95" id="fn95-ref">95</a></sup> And again, in the defense of the fifth anathema: “But what I have very often said, this now also I necessarily say. No one saying that the divine and immortal nature of the Word was changed into the flesh which is from the earth, but all confessing it to be unchangeable, cease to bestow superfluous labors on that which you ought to persuade those who are not at all deceived, that the Word, which is from God, is immutable and inconvertible according to nature. For who is so stupid and insane as to wish to think or say such base things, perhaps even suggested by the unwise themselves?”<sup><a href="#fn96" id="fn96-ref">96</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore it is not unknown to those who read the words of Scripture and the teachers of the Church inspired by faith, from what mind you fabricate accusations which do not stand and, so to speak, through the things which you do, you cry out to the orthodox: “Confess, O you, change, confusion, corruption of substances; turn the fantasy in the great and divine mystery of the incarnation. Think beyond what you ought to think; go away into a reprobate sense,<sup><a href="#fn97" id="fn97-ref">97</a></sup> transfer yourselves into that which is opposed to our error. Give opportunity for battle; for we also wish to oppose you directly against confusion with division, against conversion with duality, against fantasy with anthropolatry, we refuse. Grant battle with fitting appearance and cause. Do not say that Emmanuel is from two natures, from divinity and humanity according to their own reason perfect; do not say the same consubstantial with the Father according to divinity and the same consubstantial with us according to humanity; do not say one nature and hypostasis of God the Word incarnate. ‘Speak to us other things,’ act, report to us also another error and lead us back from the right way: take away from us that opinion and transfer from us the word of Israel.”<sup><a href="#fn98" id="fn98-ref">98</a></sup> But if you are unwilling to do this, shall we not ourselves find a beginning and cause to do this very thing? We will calumniate you, as saying that the body assumed from Mary is consubstantial with God the Word, or we will fabricate that other crime, namely that you assent to conversion of the flesh and change into the divine nature: and thus in a specious persona we will fight against you, so that for right opinion you may choose our definition, which from opposite error we impose upon you by force and, as it is said, by all and any […].”</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Did not Diodorus, the teacher of Nestorius, use this method? For against the followers of Apollinarius and against the Polemonians or Synostasiasts, whether in appearance or in reality, glorifying himself as fighting, he introduced a different opinion and attacked the truth and divided the one Christ into two. But he heard the wise Cyril saying to him, though dead: CYRIL: “Against which heresy do you fight, who have said these things, O Diodorus? Against which walls do you bring war machines? Against which cities do you stretch the bow? Do you hasten to rise up against those who wish to adhere to the opinions of Apollinarius? Do you against those who are called Polemonians or Synostasiasts?”<sup><a href="#fn99" id="fn99-ref">99</a></sup> And again, after a little: “And religion indeed is the cause of the fight against these […] but moreover, he boldly pursues those among whom the faith is found not immediate, which in the things that are approved for themselves he dares to push down.”<sup><a href="#fn100" id="fn100-ref">100</a></sup> He also rebukes Theodore, who had feigned the same pretext: who sowed impious opinions akin to those of Diodorus; and in those things which he wrote to him, he says [CYRIL]: “For he wrote a book against those who are called Synostasiasts; and although it was fitting to rebuke their ignorance and them thinking not rightly, who believed that the flesh was changed into the nature of the Word or the Word was changed into the nature of the flesh, that indeed, I know not why, this wise man omitted, but applied all his impetus to constructing calumnies against the truth, when he dared to mock the faith and doctrine, right and sincerely of the holy Fathers concerning Christ.”<sup><a href="#fn101" id="fn101-ref">101</a></sup> But Nestorius, often seizing the same excuse in his writings and thence making war against the truth, the Spirit-wise Cyril attacks in the same way, laying bare the pretexts of stripping, everywhere indeed, but also in the fifth tome of those against the blasphemies of this miserable one, thus: CYRIL: “But if anyone of those educated in sacred Scriptures considers it abominable, even if he hears only that a conversion was made in the Only-begotten, why does he accept such base and by the vote of all condemned and altogether rejected things as true which have been said, and strive to dissect that indivisible, and that after the union?”<sup><a href="#fn102" id="fn102-ref">102</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TWELVE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That to the same pattern of heretical fraud is composed the impious Tome of Leo, when under pretext of impious fantasy of Eutyches it fights against piety.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Having imitated these equipped for battle, the impious also the Tome of Leo — which the Chalcedonian synod called a pillar of orthodoxy<sup><a href="#fn103" id="fn103-ref">103</a></sup> — and having observed these chief men, pretending the cause of fighting the impious Eutyches, moved arms not of piety but of anthropolatry against the adversary: and indeed he seemed to look to the appearance of battle, but the purpose of the battle was against the truth; and against him indeed he was thought to stretch the bow, but secretly he aimed darts at the orthodox faith. And this is marvelous: he is thought to fight against the doctrine of fantasy, when he does nothing else but introduce the impious doctrine of anthropolatry into the holy churches, and divide the one and indivisible Christ into two natures and into two forms latently working a duality of person, speaking, preserving without defect, and separately vindicating to themselves their own proper things, and thus dividing the indivisibility of the divine economy more than those who divided the garments of our God and Savior crucified and did not wish to divide the seamless tunic woven from above,<sup><a href="#fn104" id="fn104-ref">104</a></sup> which is the type of the body of the Church, which they do not fear to rend, who only study to corroborate their own opinion and human invention, but that foundation upon which the Church is, which is divine and firm, as much as in them is, they root out.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But not even this deceit of the abominable strategem of the Tome of Leo, which armed the bishops gathered in Chalcedon, was passed over by the most vigilant shepherd Cyril, but was revealed beforehand, the Holy Spirit touching his mind as a harp. For he wrote in those things which he composed against Diodorus, thus: CYRIL: “Therefore I also say that the heresy of the Phantasiasts is vain and most frigid, but they ought to show, not by such sentences, which reduce the whole mystery of piety to nothing and through which the worship of man is subtly introduced and harm is brought to those who are called from the error of polytheism to the true knowledge of God through Jesus Christ, taught indeed through the Only-begotten incarnate, who alone is the true God and Son of the Father.”<sup><a href="#fn105" id="fn105-ref">105</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">When you also, O Grammarian, walked in this way of the Fathers, and followed in their footsteps, and strove, as you said, to become the advocate of those who were gathered in Chalcedon, you dismissed the defense at the beginning of your booklet, and brought against us the crime of the Synostasiasts, so that you might persuasively weave the error opposite to that against which you fight; and as much as they are pressed down, so much you fell upon the opposite rock, that you might find depravity in the opposite and divide Emmanuel by the division of two natures.</p>
