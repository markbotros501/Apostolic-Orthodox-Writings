        <p class="paragraph subheading">PROLOGUE ON THE CHAPTERS OF THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE BOOK OF SAINT MAR SEVERUS PATRIARCH OF ANTIOCH AGAINST THE GRAMMARIAN</p>
        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTERS OF THE FIRST DISCOURSE</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I. He agglutinated — VIII. A clear refutation of the accusation appended at the end, showing the falsification and audacious calumny which he foolishly and vainly fabricates against many genuine statements. — IX. It is demonstrated that "one nature" is said not only of the substance which, in a collective signification, comprehends many hypostases, but also of one person and one hypostasis composed without confusion from certain things of diverse species and in no way consubstantial. — X. That, when we are about to speak of one composite nature or hypostasis, it indicates the things from which that one nature is constituted without change. — XI. That, in the manner of former heretics who divided the one Christ in a Judaizing fashion, this one also maliciously brings forward the charge of change and confusion. — XII. That he composes himself according to the same pattern of heretical fraud as the impious Tome of Leo, when under the pretext of attacking the impious fantasy of Eutyches, he assails piety.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTERS OF THE SECOND DISCOURSE</p>

        <p class="paragraph">I. Concerning substance and hypostasis; and how the Doctors of the Church took those terms from divine Scripture; and that substance is indeed comprehensive of many persons, but hypostasis is indicative of one person. — II. That "nature" is sometimes taken for substance and common notion, but sometimes for hypostasis and one person. — III. That the term "subsistence" (exsistemia), just as the term "nature", is taken in a middle sense, being used to signify either a common notion or each individual being. — IV. That a hypostasis, whether simple or composite, is also called a "person" when it subsists individually according to its constitution; but it is impossible to assign a proper person to each of those things which subsist in composition without change and confusion, because one hypostasis is realized from the two. — V. That a proper hypostasis is sometimes also itself called "substance", and thus it has been called by the Doctors of the Church. — VI. That, wickedly and foolishly, on account of the diversity according to substance of the divinity and humanity, from which Emmanuel is constituted, these impious ones imagine a duality of natures after the union. — VII. That all heretics who cut the one Christ into two propose the same insane questions, throwing forward the substantial diversity of divinity and humanity as a cause of division. — VIII. That it is the same thing, among the orthodox Doctors, both to confess "one nature of God the Word incarnate" and to say that Christ is one nature, that is, one hypostasis, composed from divinity and humanity without confusion. — IX. A refutation of the impious who, disapproving the saying of Gregory Thaumaturgus that he affirms and defines one Christ as two natures, calumniate him as if he were a fabricator. — X. A disputation against those who presume impiously to contrive and to say that to say "one Christ" is the same as "one nature of God the Word incarnate" and "a union of two natures", from the apostolic words of Athanasius. — XI. That it is necessary to confess the divinity and humanity, diverse from each other according to substance, from which the one Christ is, and to flee the section of duality after the union; and that it is not the same to say one Christ "from two natures" and impiously to say he is known "in two natures". — XII. A demonstration showing that the confession: "Christ, after the union, is two natures undivided" opposes this confession: "One is the incarnate nature of the Son", and a refutation of the corrupted and impious interpretation of the words of the wise Cyril. — XIII. That Nestorius also, when he said "a union of two natures", was caught confessing a union of affection, whose offspring is duality, just as the effect of a true union is one according to composition and one nature and one hypostasis of the Word incarnate. — XIV. That which is separated in thought and contemplation alone does not suit those who say two natures after the union; and that true and pseudonymous union are recognized from their effects. — XV. That heretics, as if by a pact made under a guise of peace, are accustomed to say: "Let us say the words, both ours and those customary to the orthodox"; a word which will never prove the truth. Hence it cannot be said that, after the inexplicable union, there are both two undivided natures and one incarnate nature. — XVI. That each of these formulas, by which we both confess Christ to be from two natures and say there is one nature of God the Word incarnate, establishes its own perfect signification, for the sake of which it was also adopted. An overthrow of this assertion: that what we say, "Christ is one nature of the Word incarnate", has the suspicion of heresies unless we simultaneously confess him also "in two undivided natures". — XVII. A refutation of the malice of the heretics who think to hide their impiety by a change of words, and who say the formula "in two natures" is to be understood as "in two substances". — XVIII. An investigation of refutation clearly signifying that the assertion: "Christ is in two substances according to the common signification of substance" leads to a most foolish blasphemy, namely that the holy Trinity is considered incarnate to the whole human race. — XIX. A demonstration concluding the matters considered and shown in the previous chapter, namely, showing the same blasphemy is prepared by this assertion: "In Christ is held the whole substance of divinity and the whole substance of humanity", and that he does not divide the substance of divinity who does not think so indecorously. — XX. Cyril's doctrine on substance and hypostasis, by which the impiety and insanity of the blasphemy is detected. — XXI. That, where we rightly confess Emmanuel from two natures, we say he is neither from two substances, insofar as he is conceived in conjunction and according to the commonality of substance; nor again: from two persons, as this impious one vainly suspected by calumniating us. — XXII. How the formula: "Christ from two natures or hypostases" is conceived and said, and offers a contemplation of the difference of those things which are gathered into one without defect, to be considered in the composition according to thought alone, and simultaneously after the union flees from the thought, introduced by the impious, of both substances and persons and hypostases and natures. — XXIII. That to hypostases, where they are individualized and separate substances, special persons are attributed; but where such hypostases concur into a natural union and realize one hypostasis from two, they have one person. — XXIV. That he twists the words of Saint Cyril audaciously and impiously, and says: the conjunction of hypostases according to natural union is a union of substances according to common signification. — XXV. That when this impious one asserted the union of Emmanuel to be of substances according to common signification, from ignorance he did not notice he was slipping and erring into a habitual union instead of a natural union. — XXVI. The diverse impudent interpretation, which claims the natural union of hypostases is a union of substances according to common signification, is overthrown by many arguments. — XXVII. That Nestorius also, intoxicated with the same impiety, came to such speech as to say the Trinity itself was incarnate, and accused the orthodox of dividing the divine substance. — XXVIII. That when the Doctors call the hypostasis of God the Word and the flesh from Mary, which he united to himself naturally, both "substances" and "natures" and "hypostases", they are not considered to be generic substances according to common signification, from which the one Christ is understood to be. — XXIX. A notification of the disputation already held in the previous chapter against the impious and insane question which elicits: If you say Christ is consubstantial with God and the Father according to divinity and consubstantial with us according to humanity, you are forced to say him in two substances. — XXX. That it is laughable what these impious ones say, namely that they say Christ is in two natures, lest they be caught saying, like Nestorius, that Christ is in two hypostases: for Nestorius himself also used to say Christ is both in two substances and in two natures. — XXXI. That these impious ones vainly mock from ignorance the sentence by which we confess one nature of God the Word incarnate after the union, as if before the union there were two natures, but after the union one of them had been removed. — XXXII. That Nestorius also argued a dissipation and defect of one nature; and that his zealots, contaminating their own blasphemy, vainly assert they say one Christ is not indeed two hypostases, but two substances; and that the Doctors of the Church also called the hypostatic union a union according to substances. — XXXIII. That, beyond impiety, that which is said also pertains to every innovation full of ignorance and novelty: "Because we say Christ is consubstantial with God and the Father according to divinity, and consubstantial with us according to humanity, therefore we confess him in two substances, but certainly not in two hypostases, because we do not say he is co-hypostatic with the Father, nor co-hypostatic with us." — XXXIV. That the word of the impious Grammarian is a lie, pretending he was not rebuked or refuted in Theodoret, confessing one Christ to be two natures after the inexplicable union, by Saint Cyril, who, as he says, kept silent concerning the naming of a duality of natures. — XXXV. That the wise Cyril refuted Theodoret by the name of "forms" changing natures into persons. — XXXVI. That through those things by which this impious one maliciously praised Theodoret on account of the opinion of two natures or two forms, he did not conceal himself, putting forward a defense of the Tome of Leo, who similarly divides the one Christ into forms and natures through the flesh which is subjected. — XXXVII. That they have handed down the name of communion and familiarity in another and varied and entirely diverse manner: those who confess the hypostatic and natural union, but not like those who feign a habitual and voluntary union, and set up two forms or two natures operating and properly dividing, and again appropriate the passions and miracles.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">XXXVIII. A full investigation, which clearly shows Theodoret mentioning two natures in a similar way as Nestorius also had mentioned them; and that it is not permitted to say he thinks well who, after the inexplicable union, speaks of a duality of natures, and entirely and wholly denies the hypostatic union, and hastens to a habitual union; and that these impious ones are not shown to think soundly from the fact that the Doctors brought forward their words to the truth, so that by their means they might constrain them. — XXXIX. That this impious and unlearned one contradicts himself, who says Theodoret mentioned two natures impiously, and contends that he himself confesses the hypostatic union and abandons the habitual union, while he mendaciously asserts two natures to be hypostatically united, and free of persons, as he says. — XL. A demonstration of this, that Leo also, in the Tome, introduces a habitual union from dignity, which the teachers of Theodoret held in mind: which the appended blasphemy also clearly signifies; and that they are accustomed to call this sort of union also "inhabitation" and "adhesion". — XLI. To what impiety is led that which Leo says: "while the lowliness of the humanity and the loftiness of the deity are in turn"; and what is the correct sense of the word "temple" and "inhabitant"; and that Nestorius, concordantly and consistently, just like Leo, made the negation of change of God and consumption of man a cause of this quasi-according-to-dignity union. — XLII. A destruction of such futile causes, which the heretics put forward, showing the true and hypostatic union to be free from them. — XLIII. That he who says God the Word united man to himself by an affect of mercy, and did not consume him by the majesty of divine dignity, by confessing a habitual union according to person, vainly names it that union which is according to hypostasis, since he is alien from that whose property it is to realize, without defect, one nature of the Word incarnate from two, shining forth thus also with those sempiternal and God-worthy honors. — XLIV. That those who say man is united to God the Word according to dignity indicate another Son: for the principal and highest dignity is that of sonship; and that they call this union also "inhabitation", and do not notice that they transfer our habitual conjunction, according to which we are called to the adoption of sons, to their Christ assumed among the sons. — XLV. That using orthodox words which hold a middle position, they interspersed among them that union which arises from dignity, so that through it the words, which are suspect, might be deemed rightly scattered; and a clear demonstration of this assertion are those things which were written similarly by Theodoret and by Leo. — XLVI. That it belongs to those who insanely propose that union which is according to dignity, to say God the Word called the flesh his own, so that from the two names there is held a union, and likewise to say that creation is subject to Christ as man and as God and adores him; for thence both two sons and two Christs are conceived, one indeed perfect, the other however imperfect and introduced surreptitiously: which the Fathers, whom we follow, anathematize. — XLVII. That Nestorius also, just like Theodoret and Leo, used to inweave the loss of person through words holding a middle position, when his own deceit and machination for saying he confesses both two undivided natures and divides only in thought was from dignity; and that he used to say they communicate with each other both will and operation. — XLVIII. That Leo called the union according to dignity a unity of person, just as both Theodoret and Nestorius; and that they are accustomed, to cover their impiety, to use permutations of names, and to call "assumed man" that which is assumed, and again to call "God" and "man" the divinity and humanity. — XLIX. That Theodoret also used to call that union a union "of person" singularly, not "of persons" plurally, containing that union through participation of dignity and glory and commonality; and that Leo, when he says: "so that we confess one Son of God and Word and flesh", is refuted because he gathers God and man into one name of Son; and that they pretended as a cause of the impious duality after the union that difference according to substance of those things which are gathered into one without confusion. — L. That in a division into two, even if one divides only in thought, immediately also the person of each nature or hypostasis is simultaneously understood; but the entering power of the hypostatic union destroys the very thought of duality, and shows one nature of the Word incarnate from two; and thence it appears that it cannot be that one says those natures, from which the one Christ is constituted, are substances according to common signification. That Leo, as often as he mentioned the union, called it either a unity of person, or a communion of authority and dignity, but nowhere did he name it natural or hypostatic. — LI. That the Chalcedonians, defining Christ in two natures and one hypostasis, used the name "hypostasis" for the appellation "person": which formula, through that union which is according to dignity, comprehends in the one name of Christ and Son one nature, and that Theodoret wrote manifestly, interpreting their definition. And that in those things which were written in the synod itself, the formula which says one Christ from two natures was indeed rejected, but the formula which defines him in two natures united and undivided was accepted, so that the mention of Cyril's epistles in the definition itself, placed as if through illusion, might become idle. — LII. That John of Cilicia and Dorotheus of Marcianopolis, open Nestorians, said their opinions were proclaimed by Leo's Tome; and that Theodoret also, when he spoke in concordance with the words of these, showed from the writings of Nestorius how the Chalcedonian synod said the one Christ is understood in two natures and in one person and hypostasis. — LIII. That after Theodoret, compelled at Chalcedon, anathematized Nestorius, the same man again interpreted the definition of the synod itself from the very words of Nestorius at Chalcedon. And that he is ridiculous and self-contradictory who becomes a defender of the synod and praises Theodoret and says he confesses Christ himself composed from two natures: which neither the synodus said, nor the Tome of Leo, but on the contrary gave a pseudonymous union according to dignity. — LIV. That anathematizing John of Cilicia, they neither again refute Theodoret, nor the wickedness and impiety of them; and that Theodoret, remaining in his own impiety, very often changed with the times. — LV. A refutation of the impious Grammarian himself, who said Theodoret, in the reprehensions of Cyril's chapters, provoked only a suspicion of the accusation of two persons, when Theodoret manifestly said there are two christs and sons and that Christ according to the flesh, as a prophet, received revelations. And what sort of blasphemy this is, is understood from those who formerly labored with such heresies and from the orthodox institution of the holy Fathers. — LVI. A clear investigation of other blasphemies of Theodoret also, and a comparison of similar words of Leo, by which they lead two persons into two forms and two natures, varying their impiety by a changed use of names and, as is fitting for duality, asking: which nature suffered; and it is shown this is alien to those who think Christ is one. — LVII. That those who define Christ in two undivided natures, and assert they say he is one and the same, say this very thing by contriving a union of person and from dignity; which union of person this impious defender, when he appended Leo's words, blushing, cut off.</p>
