    <h1>Against the Impious Grammarian<br>Second Oration</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph subheading">SECOND ORATION</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER ONE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>On substance and hypostasis; and how the doctors of the Church took those terms from divine Scripture; and that substance indeed is comprehensive of many persons, but hypostasis is indicative of one person.</em><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fn1-ref">1</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Since therefore the apparatus of accusation<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fn2-ref">2</a></sup> has been so constituted by you and, as you see, has been dissipated and none appears, I shall desist from the defense of that patron which you wished to make and strenuously show, if you think you have anything that no one can impugn. Will you now also again seem to be a fugitive and decline the fight, like those who decline the reproof of disaster? For you wish to cover the audacious section of the duplicity of natures after the inexplicable union, while you are ashamed of the revelation of your blasphemy. With these things evident, you clearly see that, according to the prophetic word, you have labored in the multitude of your ways.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fn3-ref">3</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But, because you judged that a discourse on substance and hypostasis and nature ought to be proposed to the hearers at the beginning of your defense, I also judged it necessary to bring forth fully and perfectly in public the statements about these things from inspired Scripture and, as much as I can, the institution of the holy Fathers, so that those who encounter these explanations and those who scrutinize my and your words may clearly perceive them.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, the name "substance" is significative of something that is; for it befits us to produce defined demonstrations of the words themselves, adducing the sentences and words of divine Scripture. Concerning this matter, therefore, by a voice as if from the person of God and the Father coming to Moses and saying: "I am who I am. Thus shall you say to the children of Israel: He who is sent me to you,"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fn4-ref">4</a></sup> and John the theologian and evangelist concerning the Son and the living and subsisting Word and begotten from the Father before the ages, saying, in the gospel indeed: "In the beginning was the Word,"<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fn5-ref">5</a></sup> in his epistle: "That which was from the beginning,"<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fn6-ref">6</a></sup> in his Apocalypse: "Who is and who was and who is to come,"<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fn7-ref">7</a></sup> and Job the philosopher concerning the Holy Spirit, who proceeds eternally from God and the Father and is in hypostasis, saying: "The divine Spirit who is in my nostrils,"<sup><a href="#fn8" id="fn8-ref">8</a></sup> and through this they clearly signify Him to be perpetual and to subsist and to be comprehensive of all creation, and we in Him live, move, and are. The deifying mystagogues of the Church defined the holy and most exalted Trinity to be of one substance. For if the Father is, and the Son is, and the Holy Spirit is, whose being and equality of dignity and eternity are the same, it is certain that their substance is one and the same. For it is manifest that the name οὐσία (ousia) is derived from the participle ὤν (on, being). Therefore this term is not ἀγραφος (unwritten), as the frigid and lamentable little orations of the Arians bark, but it is known, and indeed thoroughly known to divine Scriptures.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"Hypostasis," however, with respect to the signification of existence, is the same as substance. For just as substance signifies being (ens), so also hypostasis indicates subsisting being (subsistens). Now "being" and "subsisting" do not differ from each other. Thus God is introduced saying through the prophet Jeremiah: "If they had stood in my hypostasis,"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fn9-ref">9</a></sup> and He who said: "I am who I am,"<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fn10-ref">10</a></sup> also said: "If they had stood in my hypostasis,"<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fn11-ref">11</a></sup> and signifies that He who is and subsists was perpetually and never was either not being or not subsisting, He who gathered in Himself all that, namely eternal being and subsisting.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The same, with respect to the signification of being and subsisting, is also the name "existentia."<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fn12-ref">12</a></sup> For between being and subsisting and existing there is no difference. Thus also the prophet singing says: "God will hear and humble them, existing before the ages."<sup><a href="#fn13" id="fn13-ref">13</a></sup> Therefore, with respect to this indeed, communion is had between substance and hypostasis and existence, but with respect to another there is great distance and difference. For substance indeed is also significative of genus and of a notion comprehending many species;<sup><a href="#fn14" id="fn14-ref">14</a></sup> hypostasis, however, is a certain limitation significative of one form, that is, of person, when it does not have communion with homogeneous things according to property and includes a subject with distinct character;<sup><a href="#fn15" id="fn15-ref">15</a></sup> existence, however, we find taken sometimes indeed from common genus and notion, as substance, sometimes from the distinct and defined notion of a certain one, as hypostasis.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But it is necessary to place before our eyes, as clearly as possible, that which is said, and the demonstration should be such that it falls as little as possible from our present contemplation. The name "man" is indicative of the genus and of the whole human nature, as in a certain place God said in the book of Genesis to Noah and to his sons: "Who sheds the blood of man, his blood shall be shed,"<sup><a href="#fn16" id="fn16-ref">16</a></sup> "for in the image of God I made man."<sup><a href="#fn17" id="fn17-ref">17</a></sup> For here He does not name one man, this or that, but comprehends the whole genus in the appellation "man"; for He established the law equally over the whole genus, avoiding the killing of any man, because we are all equally made in the image of God, because we are created rational, inasmuch as to us alone of all living beings upon earth a rational, free, and principal soul is given,<sup><a href="#fn18" id="fn18-ref">18</a></sup> and capable of wisdom and exercise and excellent things of religious service, by which it is possible to imitate God. Nor can anyone say that one rational and intelligent being belongs to this one, but not to that one; for we are all equally adorned with intellectual faculty and the principal ornament of the soul, inasmuch as we are said to be made in the image of God: for to be without reason and intellect, and to be led by sensuality alone, is proper not to the human soul but to beasts.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Similarly also that which Isaiah the prophet said: "All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man is as the flower of grass,"<sup><a href="#fn19" id="fn19-ref">19</a></sup> comprehends the very substance, the whole genus of men: for it indicates the origin of flesh from the earth, and its corruptible and mortal nature, and, just as things which are outside and around it, it is produced on the same day and immediately falls, equally passes over the whole humanity, as also Job says: "Remember that you fashioned me as clay, and into earth you return me."<sup><a href="#fn20" id="fn20-ref">20</a></sup> And again: "For man born of a woman is short-lived."<sup><a href="#fn21" id="fn21-ref">21</a></sup> For in this he does not differ from his neighbor; therefore Elihu also said to Job: "You have been made from clay as I also; from the same we have been made."<sup><a href="#fn22" id="fn22-ref">22</a></sup> Of this sort is also that which Job again said: "Death is rest for man."<sup><a href="#fn23" id="fn23-ref">23</a></sup> For here he calls every man "man," because death is similarly the unique end for all men.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From these words and sentences of divine Scripture the definition of man is also gathered: for he is defined to be a rational, mortal animal, capable of intellect and knowledge. And this every man is, and no one among men is outside this definition. For anyone who is man is certainly rational; anyone who is man is certainly mortal; anyone who is man is certainly capable of intellect and knowledge. Therefore, the name "man," as we said before, is significative of substance, signifying the community and co-equality and identity and co-substantiality of the whole genus.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">If, however, someone perhaps names Job or Elkanah, the father of Samuel, by proper appellation, he indicates, so to speak with a finger, one man, this or that, and his one hypostasis. For as soon as someone hears "Job," he understands a man indeed, but not every man, but one from those who are under the substance and under the common genus of humanity. For the mind of the hearer does not spread the proper appellation "Job" to the amplitude of quantitative diffusion and comprehend all men, but by the property of the nomination it restrains and limits the intellect and directs it to the one hypostasis of this one, and separately signifies the things that represent this same one. For it provides to understand Job, the king and inhabitant of the land of Uz, who was a proven witness to God in all justice, who was delivered to the evil demon and Satan as for a contest, that is, for all temptations, to give proof of this testimony; who, troubled for the ignorant thoughts or sins of his sons, daily offered prayers and victims to God and was despoiled of them and at the same time of his whole possession, and in the privation of sons and poverty after the abundance of sons and riches uttered this grateful voice, marvelous and in no way obscured by time: "The Lord gave, the Lord took away; as it pleased the Lord, so it has been done; blessed be the name of the Lord;"<sup><a href="#fn24" id="fn24-ref">24</a></sup> who moreover was struck with an ulcer over his whole body and showed himself strong against intolerable pain and long enduring, and against the reproof of his friends, who reproved him through ignorance of pain, and who obtained the testimony from God and was crowned with testimony and received divine praises of testimony.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Likewise, if someone hears "Elkanah," from the proper appellation he sees in mind the characteristic forms of one man, not of many but of one hypostasis. For as it were in thought he recalls him who is known to be from the region of Ramah; who lived according to the law; who diligently fulfilled the victims and offerings prescribed through Moses and the other things, at the recurring set times, and ascended to the usual place of the tabernacle; who lived with Hannah, a chaste wife and most loving of God, who loved conjugal intercourse for the procreation of children and was not sterile, but by her prayer and her tears overcame the defect of nature and received offspring from petition; who brought up Samuel, who became famous among the prophets and great among those who invoke the Lord, to whom it was entrusted to anoint the kings of Israel and who inviolately foresaw what was to come and prophesied what would be, so that from all his words not one fell to the ground, as divine Scripture says; therefore Elkanah also is read, who through the things said by us is known to be a man indeed as Job, but is another of them and separately and properly subsisting. For hypostasis at the same time posits the identity of existence to the homogeneous, and by distinct and unconfused characters separates him who is indicated from those who share the genus and substance with him. For Elkanah will never be thought to be Job because he, like him, is man through the form of existence; nor again will Job himself ever pass into that which is Elkanah: for each of them firmly remains in his own hypostasis, neither mixed nor blended with the other, although they are joined by the very identity of existence. Therefore divine Scripture, when it was about to speak about each of those who have been mentioned—I mean Job and Elkanah—began dissimilarly: "A certain man was in the land of Uz"<sup><a href="#fn25" id="fn25-ref">25</a></sup> and: "A certain man was from Ramah;"<sup><a href="#fn26" id="fn26-ref">26</a></sup> and through this word "man" it placed the identity and community of existence of each of them, but by saying "certain" and "in the land of Uz" and "from Ramah," it unconfusedly determined each one of the hypostases. However, if it had said only: "Man was," the name would be indicative of existence; but since it falls into indetermination, it is significative of any man and indicative of substance, not of this or that man, as is that: "Man, when he was in honor, did not understand; he is compared to senseless beasts, and is made like to them."<sup><a href="#fn27" id="fn27-ref">27</a></sup> But by that which Scripture placed besides "man": "certain" and "in the land of Uz," it determined existence to proper signification.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore existence, when it is said indeed without determination, effects generic indication and is distinguished very little from substance; but when it is joined to proper distinction, it obtains the force of hypostasis. And the name "man," when placed indeterminately, one can call it both substance and generic existence; but that: "A certain man was in the land of Uz," is called both hypostasis and proper existence. And according to this sentence, "existence" is taken sometimes indeed for substance, as I said before, sometimes for hypostasis.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But now let us pass to the discourse on the holy Trinity, being directed somewhat obscurely by that demonstration which appeared before. The name "God" is common to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. For, as God is the Father, so God is the Son, so God is the Holy Spirit; and as God the Father is without time and eternal, so God the Son is without time and eternal, and likewise the Holy Spirit. And as the Father is, without ever beginning to be—for He is always—so also the Son and the Holy Spirit are; as we said before. Therefore, if there is one divinity of those three, and the same and equal in dignity and in no way diverse, there is one substance of the divinity of those three, since it is evident that substance is understood as divinity because it exists and appears commonly in those three, in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, with no difference at all existing in anyone, whether superiority or inferiority. Hypostasis, however, is indeed one of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TWO</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That the term "nature" is sometimes taken for substance and common notion, sometimes for hypostasis and person.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And let these things be said concerning substance and hypostasis: but the name "nature" is sometimes significative of that which is common and of genus, as "substance," sometimes of one species and subject, as also "hypostasis." And receive, if you please, a witness speaking openly and precisely of this assertion, Saint Cyril—we could also adduce very many testimonies from other wise doctors—; for he wrote in the fourth tome against the blasphemies of Nestorius thus: CYRIL: "For one is the nature of the divinity; but properly subsists the Father and also the Son, and likewise the Holy Spirit."<sup><a href="#fn28" id="fn28-ref">28</a></sup> And again, after other things: "For one nature of the divinity is understood in the holy and consubstantial Trinity."<sup><a href="#fn29" id="fn29-ref">29</a></sup> And here indeed he said the name "nature" for "substance" and common notion; but truly, in the epistle to the queens, whose beginning is: "The ornament indeed of the whole earth,"<sup><a href="#fn30" id="fn30-ref">30</a></sup> he used the name "nature" for proper hypostasis, thus writing: CYRIL: "We say that He, ineffably begotten from the substance of God and the Father, His Only-begotten Word, the maker of the ages, through whom and in whom all things are, the true light, giving life to every nature—for life appeared as from the life of the Father—in the last times of the age, the Father willing to save the earthly genus fallen into curse and precipitated through sin into death and corruption, took hold of the seed of Abraham, as it is written, and shared in blood and flesh, that is, was made man."<sup><a href="#fn31" id="fn31-ref">31</a></sup> Behold clearly he calls the Only-begotten Word, the one hypostasis of the Son, one of the Trinity, "giving life to every nature," taking the name "nature" for hypostasis.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This Saint Alexander also, bishop of the great and most God-loving city of the Alexandrians, and president of the celebrated synod of 228 Fathers, in the encyclical epistle to the bishops against Arius and his followers, clearly showed with these words: ALEXANDER: "Those who indeed accepted the words of the salutary passion and humiliation and emptying and so-called poverty of His, and of those things which our Savior undertook for us, remembering them, apply them to the supreme divinity of His from the beginning to be rejected; but those words which are significative of His natural glory and nobility and dwelling with the Father, they consigned to oblivion. Of such sort is that: 'I and the Father are one;'<sup><a href="#fn32" id="fn32-ref">32</a></sup> which the Lord said, not calling Himself the Father, nor signifying that two natures in hypostasis are one, but because the Son, being prepared by nature, most exactly preserves the paternal likeness of the Father, since He has the likeness of Him in all things from nature, and is the undissimilar image of the Father and the expressed figure of the prototype."<sup><a href="#fn33" id="fn33-ref">33</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Here it is to be considered and observed how this saint calls the hypostases of the Father and the Son two natures and, signifying that he takes the name "nature" for proper signification, said "two natures in hypostasis," knowing also that the name "nature" is often said for substance. But this is to be seen not only concerning the divinity, but also concerning humanity; for the name "nature" is assumed sometimes for substance and generic signification, sometimes for proper signification and of one hypostasis. And indeed it is taken for substance and the whole genus of men, as the wise Cyril indicated in the third tome against the blasphemies of Nestorius, writing thus: CYRIL: "The nature of man fell down from the transgression of Adam into curse and death; but it labored moreover with facility of sinning, since it is drawn to evil concupiscences by the law which wars in the members of the flesh. God sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and condemned sin in His flesh, that the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit."<sup><a href="#fn34" id="fn34-ref">34</a></sup> But to that which is taken again for hypostasis, we adduced above Saint Cyril writing against the reprehensions of the impious Andrew concerning the eighth anathematism, writing these things: CYRIL: "Since indeed concerning one person and nature or one hypostasis, considering from which things it is or is composed naturally, he adds the preposition 'with' or 'with,' he preserved even thus that which is one according to composition and defined it as in no way to be divided into two."<sup><a href="#fn35" id="fn35-ref">35</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">It appears therefore that here also nature is called one person and one hypostasis; but where the Doctor said that the nature of man fell down on account of the transgression of Adam into curse and death, by the name "nature" he signified the whole genus of men. Therefore "nature" signifies sometimes substance, sometimes hypostasis.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER THREE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That the term "existence," like the term "nature," holds a middle position, since it is taken to signify either common notion or each individual.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Thus also "existence" is significative both of substance and of hypostasis, and is a certain middle term; and it signifies now this, now that, according to the underlying sentence. Which Saint Athanasius will immediately show with few words, writing to the bishops of Africa thus: ATHANASIUS: "For hypostasis and substance is existence: for it is and exists."<sup><a href="#fn36" id="fn36-ref">36</a></sup> But the same, in the oration on the salutary manifestation of Christ, takes existence for generic notion, that is, for substance, against those who impiously profess the errors of Apollinaris and fantasy, contending thus: ATHANASIUS: "And what benefit for men would there be in these things, unless the Lord had appeared in the identity of existence and nature and in the novelty of nature, as the Apostle said: 'Which He renewed for us, a new and living way,'<sup><a href="#fn37" id="fn37-ref">37</a></sup> saying: 'I am the way and the life and the truth'?<sup><a href="#fn38" id="fn38-ref">38</a></sup> But you say that believers are saved by likeness and imitation, not by renewal and firstfruits: for therefore also Christ became the firstborn among many brethren and the firstfruits of those who sleep, who is the head of the body of the Church."<sup><a href="#fn39" id="fn39-ref">39</a></sup> And again, in the epistle on the Holy Spirit, he similarly wrote these things: ATHANASIUS: "But the Trinity is, not as to name only and as to the species of the word, but according to truth and existence the Trinity. For as the Father is He who is, so His Word, which is, is God over all, and the Holy Spirit is not non-existent, but truly is and subsists. Nor does the catholic Church think anything less than this, lest it fall to the imitators of today's Caiaphas and to Sabellius; nor does it understand anything more, lest it fall into the polytheism of the pagans."<sup><a href="#fn40" id="fn40-ref">40</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But we find the wise Cyril in many places using the name "existence" for proper hypostasis. For he wrote in the seventh book of the exposition of the gospel of John thus: CYRIL: "For they confess the holy Trinity to be indeed in proper existences: for the Father is Father and not the Son; and again the Son is Son and not the Father, and the Holy Spirit is properly the Holy Spirit. Yet they do not at all recede from communion and unity among themselves. But we do not think of them singly, who are acknowledged, as our bodies, divided from unity among themselves; but we esteem them to be indeed in one substance and in unity of nature without any controversy; nevertheless separately in the property of hypostases and persons each is incomprehensibly compacted, so to speak, into that which he is, and remains in himself; for thus we see one divinity in the holy and consubstantial Trinity."<sup><a href="#fn41" id="fn41-ref">41</a></sup> And the same again, in the seventh book of the exposition of the gospel of Matthew, said thus concerning the same contemplation: CYRIL: "For the holy Trinity is known in the Father and in the Son and in the Holy Spirit; but the appellation of each one of those who are numbered signifies not a part of it, but the whole absolutely. For God is indivisible and simple; for He is separated indeed in existences and in names and in persons to each according to proper constitution, but the unity of nature conjoins them into one glory and dignity and adoration: for one is the divinity to us."<sup><a href="#fn42" id="fn42-ref">42</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">The wise Basil also, in the oration of syllogisms against the proud and impious Eunomius, takes existence for proper hypostasis, where he says that the name "unbegotten" underlies the signification of a certain existence, not of substance; for that name does not show what the Father is according to substance, but shows only the mode of existence, signifying that He is not from anyone, but is unbegotten; where he also strives to reduce that unlearned man to absurdity, thus writing: BASIL: "If impossible is contrary to possible, and foolish to wise, and all things that are opposed are contrary to each other, unbegotten is contrary to begotten. Therefore the Father is contrary to the Son according to substance, if unbegotten is not a mode of existence but substance."<sup><a href="#fn43" id="fn43-ref">43</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Saint Cyril, however, not only concerning the divinity, but also concerning our humanity, used the appellation of existence for hypostasis, when to Nestorius, who conjoined God the Word and Him who is from Mary, man, through adhesion, as he said, of the dignity of sonship and, as he raved, equality of dignity thence following, in the second tome against the blasphemies of this impious man, Cyril thus wrote: "But you ignorantly call adhesion equality of dignity. For what is this mode of adhesion? Do you not know that it is pleasing to those who are in the world to be in worldly splendors? Who are enriched by princes with dignities, but sometimes, while they are strong with equal dignities, are separated among themselves, I say by singular existence, nay in that very thing that it pleases them to think and do the same things."<sup><a href="#fn44" id="fn44-ref">44</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">You see how the doctor of piety wisely said that men, who hold the same grade of equality of dignity, are separated by singular existence, that is, by proper hypostasis. For they are not separated by generic existence, for men are equally and conjointly substance. Therefore existence, like nature, is significative sometimes of substance, sometimes of hypostasis.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER FOUR</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That hypostasis, whether simple or composite, is also called person when taken singly according to constitution; but to those things which subsist in composition without change and confusion, it is impossible to assign proper person to each, because one hypostasis is absolved from the two.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Moreover, we know that hypostasis has been called person by the mystagogues of the holy Church, and that has been premised in the testimonies adduced above, when Basil wrote to Amphilochius concerning the holy Trinity thus: BASIL: "...so that through all things both unity is preserved in the confession of one divinity, and the property of persons is proclaimed in the discretion of those properties which are conceived in each."<sup><a href="#fn45" id="fn45-ref">45</a></sup> And Saint Cyril said in the seventh book of the exposition of the gospel of John: CYRIL: "...but we shall esteem them to be in one substance and in unity of nature without any controversy; nevertheless separately in the property of hypostases each is incomprehensibly compacted, so to speak, into that which he is, and remains in himself."<sup><a href="#fn46" id="fn46-ref">46</a></sup> But Gregory the Theologian also manifestly teaches the same in the oration on the holy Lights, saying: GREGORY: "Moreover, when I say God, be illuminated on all sides by one light and three lights: three indeed, according to the properties or hypostases and, if it pleases anyone to call them thus, according to persons—for we shall not dispute about names, provided the words lead to the same sense—but one, according to the reason of substance or divinity."<sup><a href="#fn47" id="fn47-ref">47</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">The name "person" has been taken with respect to the Trinity for the accurate signification of distinct, and in no way confused or commingled, individuality of the three hypostases, but not so that we fashion human form or some circumscribed and figured image for that incorporeal substance, unfigurable and above all. For we hear Paul, in the Acts, speaking to the crowds at Athens and saying: "We ought not to think that the divinity is like gold or silver or stone sculpted by art or thought of man,"<sup><a href="#fn48" id="fn48-ref">48</a></sup> for He is above every movement of intellect and thought and corporeal imagination. But each one of men and his hypostasis we have previously called person, as Saint Cyril indicated, in the writings against the impious Andrew, who had reprehended the eighth chapter; constructing a defense he says these things: CYRIL: "For since concerning one person and nature or one hypostasis, considering from which things it is or is composed naturally, he adds the preposition 'with' or 'with,' he preserves even thus that the thing signified is one according to composition, and defines it as in no way to be separated into two. But when hypostases are first divided into two, and for that, that each should be conceived singly and separately, the preposition 'with' or 'with' is said, then we say that the signification is made of two or many, and in no way of one according to composition. For example, if perhaps I say that the soul of man is co-honored with its own body, if any honor is made by someone towards one man, who is from both; or if anyone says that the soul of man is one animal with its own body, he in no way defines this one man into two men, but seems rather not to be ignorant of those things from which he is or is composed naturally. When however I say: Peter and John are called men together, or: With Peter also John was going up into the temple, now the preposition 'with' or 'with' does not make the signification of one man. For Peter is not composed with John, nor are both in the constitution of one man. Why therefore do they machinate against the truth and divide this one into two Christs?"<sup><a href="#fn49" id="fn49-ref">49</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore from those things which have been said and adduced, it is to be understood that hypostasis signifies proper person when it subsists in distinct subsistence, whether it is simple or composite. That simple indeed, as concerning the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; for we have heard how Doctor Cyril, in the exposition of the gospel of Matthew, said that existences, that is, hypostases and persons and names, are separated according to proper constitution. Composite truly, as where it is said concerning Peter or John subsisting from soul and body perfectly having themselves according to their own proper reason, since indeed in their own constitution both Peter and John subsist: for again we have heard the word of the Doctor declaring that Peter is not composed with John, nor are both in one hypostasis of man, even if it is said that the other with the other was going up into the temple or they are called apostles together. And so, when soul and body, from which one man is had, preserve their unconfused hypostasis—for neither is changed into the other, because they subsist in composition, not in singular subsistence—proper person is not ascribed to them; but that which is absolved from them shows one hypostasis and one person. So also Emmanuel from divinity and from humanity, that is, from human flesh animated by a rational soul, perfectly having themselves according to their own reason, is one person through concurrence, without change and without confusion, from two into unity, with God the Word holding His hypostasis, I say His divinity more ancient than the ages without change, and humanity, which He inexplicably united to Himself in His hypostasis without change remaining, since it cannot be that proper person is ascribed to each of them, I mean to the divinity of the Only-begotten and to the humanity itself united to Him, because they appear in composition and in no way subsist separately in the property of subsistence and are found separate, but from the suitable and incomprehensible commingling of them among themselves one hypostasis is absolved from both, from divinity and from humanity, and consequently one person, that is, of the incarnate Word Himself: which Word indeed eternally and before the ages subsisted incorporeally, but in the last days for mercy deigned to be implicated in flesh animated by a rational soul, that He might be acknowledged corporeal on account of the economy, He who according to divine substance is incorporeal and thus fills all things, nay holds all things ineffably and as He alone, with His Father and the Holy Spirit, knows.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Now, that in a composite, as in Emmanuel and in any man, those things from which they are composed indeed remain without change in their hypostasis, but proper person is not ascribed to each element; but that those things which subsist in proper subsistence, because they are separated in hypostases, are also defined in distinct persons: that we clearly see, if we give docile ears to the wise Saint Cyril rebuking Nestorius, who divided the one Christ into two natures or hypostases and deceitfully asserted that he confessed one person of both, because there is one dignity of both and one name of sonship. For as unlearned, Cyril teaches him that it cannot be that hypostases, which through natural union do not concur into one, but subsist in proper subsistence, have one person, but they are to be called two persons, even though they have one rank and one dignity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And in the second tome against the blasphemies of this foolish man he says thus: CYRIL: “You see how the rule of discourse is variously turned about and how he tries to show that the generation of the Only-begotten would not have been otherwise unless some confusion or mixture of the hypostases among themselves had taken place, even though the doctors of the Church did not hand down this mode to us mystically. For we say that a true conjunction was made, the Word uniting the body to Himself, while remaining what He was. But this man, having nothing of such doctrines in his mind, labored with immoderate impiety, separating Christ into two persons and into two hypostases entirely distinct from each other, while assigning to each of them the words proper to it; and again he says that there is one Christ Jesus the Lord, as a man adhering to God by dignity alone, not by a true union, that is, a union according to nature. How then is Christ already one and the Son and the Lord, if, as you have divided them, it befits both separately, so that they may be so named and truly be, since the hypostases are in no way united among themselves according to union, but are united according to dignity or authority or power alone? Moreover, investigating the nature of things, we will not see that those which are in equality of dignity lose on that account what they are in the property of subsistence; nor again will that which they are in glory, being equal, suffice for having union. For example: Peter and John were among the apostles and were holy and adorned by the Spirit with equal honors and virtues from the Savior of all, Christ; for they heard, among other things: ‘You are the light of the world,’<sup><a href="#fn50" id="fn50-ref">50</a></sup> and again: ‘Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons.’<sup><a href="#fn51" id="fn51-ref">51</a></sup> Therefore, on account of the equality of dignity and equality of authority which they had, shall we say that both are reckoned as one man, and that this suffices for them for union, that union, I say, which is held in hypostasis? Otherwise, how would it not rightly be judged most foolish to think so?”<sup><a href="#fn52" id="fn52-ref">52</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, hypostases, where they indeed subsist separately, are also separated into two persons, and to each of them Cyril attributes a proper person as subsisting in the property of subsistence; but where they are gathered together among themselves through a natural union, they indeed do not suffer that mixture which is from confusion, but they absolve one hypostasis from both and one person. For there are not two, because they ceased, according to the word of the Doctor, to subsist in the property of subsistence. For he says also, in the third tome against the blasphemies of Nestorius, these things: CYRIL: “Therefore, if the hypostases, as you say, are divided into two and understood to exist separately and singly, how will their coming together into one person be accomplished?”<sup><a href="#fn53" id="fn53-ref">53</a></sup> Likewise in the oration addressed to the most pious emperor Theodosius, he said: CYRIL: “Do not, I pray, separate nor divide, after the union, into a man singly and the Word of God, and thus have two persons for us. What a fantasy!”<sup><a href="#fn54" id="fn54-ref">54</a></sup> But in the Scholia he wrote: ‘Even though the Word has come together with humanity into true union, the hypostases have remained unconfused; nevertheless, they are not signified as two persons; for they have come together into true union, since they do not subsist in the property of subsistence.’<sup><a href="#fn55" id="fn55-ref">55</a></sup> Therefore also, writing to Nestorius the third synodical letter, he said thus: CYRIL: ‘Therefore let us attribute all the evangelical utterances to one person, to the one hypostasis of the incarnate Word: for there is one Lord Jesus Christ, as it is written.’”<sup><a href="#fn56" id="fn56-ref">56</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What has been said by us, summarized, is these: substance indeed is significative of community and generic notion; but hypostasis represents one separately subsisting subject, which we also call person, where it subsists in the property of subsistence, whether it is simple or gathered from composition into an individual union. To those things, however, from which the composite is, even though they are preserved unconfused, because they subsist in composition and not at all separately, proper person is not ascribed. For how would those things bear this, which from an inseparable concurrence with each other have absolved one person and one hypostasis? But we have recognized nature and subsistence to be one and the same, and they are taken sometimes indeed for substance, but sometimes for hypostasis.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER FIVE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That the proper hypostasis is called by the name "substance" and thus is so called by the doctors of the Church.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">With these things thus distinguished, and the virtue and meaning of each of the terms set before our contemplation, as far as possible, illuminated, it must be known that we find the distinguished doctors of the holy churches often using the name “substance” for the proper hypostasis. And see, I pray, Basil, wise in the Spirit, writing in the first of the orations against the impious Eunomius these things: BASIL: “Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the words spoken about Himself, when He signifies grace and mercy from the economy to men, by certain terms appearing in Him, signifies this one, calling Himself the door, the way, the bread, the vine, the shepherd, and the lamp. Not because He is many-named—for not all names lead to the same sense among themselves, since one thing is signified by ‘light,’ another by ‘vine’—but because, since He is one according to subject and one and simple and in no way composite substance, He names Himself now in one way, now in another, accommodating appellations diverse among themselves to perceptions: for according to the diversity of operations and according to the relation to those who are benefited, He also imposes diverse names upon Himself.”<sup><a href="#fn57" id="fn57-ref">57</a></sup> But he said Christ is “one simple and in no way composite substance,” that is, the one hypostasis of the Only-begotten Word, who was simple in the nature of divinity before He was incarnate, and who for the sake of the salvific economy is united to humanity: for Basil was disputing with the unclean Eunomius concerning the bare and separately understood hypostasis of God the Word Himself.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Nor is it to be wondered at if he called Christ “He who, before He was incarnate, was simple and in no way composite”: for the God-taught synod of 318 holy Fathers did the same, when they established for us the definition of the true faith. For they said: THE NICAENE SYNOD: “We believe also in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-begotten, born of the Father, that is, from the substance of the Father,”<sup><a href="#fn58" id="fn58-ref">58</a></sup> even though the name of Jesus Christ in no way suited Him when before the ages He was begotten of the Father: for that name is new and acquired and made proper on account of the incarnation. But the Fathers did not simply say these things, nor confounding theology and economy, but diligently they called Him by these new names, while speaking of His generation older than the ages and signifying that He who was before the ages is not one and He who came in the last times another, but one and the same, who indeed before was without flesh, but in His own times and afterwards incarnate from Mary, and called Jesus Christ. For these names have received their beginning and cause from the economy, just as Saint Cyril also teaches in what he wrote to the impious Diodorus, saying these things: CYRIL: “But Christ or Jesus is understood to have been called by no one before He was made man, that which is the Word from God the Father.”<sup><a href="#fn59" id="fn59-ref">59</a></sup> For “Christ” indeed signifies anointing, but “Jesus” is a name imposed manifestly by the voice of the angel and before the conception in the holy Virgin upon Him who from her according to flesh was born.<sup><a href="#fn60" id="fn60-ref">60</a></sup> And similar things he says also in what he wrote to the most pious queens thus: THE SAME: “For when the Word became flesh, then we say that He was also named Christ Jesus.”<sup><a href="#fn61" id="fn61-ref">61</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But he, the divine Basil, also in the second oration against Eunomius seems to call the hypostasis of the Only-begotten “substance,” writing thus: BASIL: “But He is called and is the begotten image and the Son: for He is the brightness of the glory of God, and the wisdom and power and justice of God, not as a habit or [aptitude], but a natural substance and operating and the brightness of the glory of God, because He shows the whole Father in Himself, resplendent from all His glory.”<sup><a href="#fn62" id="fn62-ref">62</a></sup> The same also, he who emits spiritual rivers from his intellectual womb and pours them forth soundly and copiously through his tongue, John, bishop of Constantinople, in the fourth oration of the exposition of the Gospel of John, wrote thus: JOHN OF CONSTANTINOPLE: “But this Word is a certain hypostatic substance; which proceeded from the Father without passion, for this, as I said before, He signified through the appellation of the Word.”<sup><a href="#fn63" id="fn63-ref">63</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, here indeed, the doctors of orthodoxy called the divinity of Christ, that is, the proper hypostasis of the Only-begotten, substance; but often they also call His humanity, that is, the flesh endowed with a rational soul and mind which through the economy He made His own when united to His hypostasis, by the name of substance. Which is easy to see immediately from what Saint Cyril wrote to Succensus the second time thus: CYRIL: “For if, after we said ‘one nature of the Word,’ we had remained silent, as if we had admitted ‘incarnate,’ perhaps excluding the dispensation, there might be for them an argument, and indeed not inept, for feigned questioning: Where is the perfection of humanity, or where also does the substance like to us subsist? But because both the perfection in humanity and the designation of our substance is brought in through this, that we said ‘incarnate,’ let them cease to lean on a reed staff.”<sup><a href="#fn64" id="fn64-ref">64</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">It is recognized therefore that also that human flesh animated by a rational soul, which is hypostatically united to the Word, is called “substance,” because the name “substance” is sometimes taken by the doctors for proper designation.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER SIX</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That these impious men wrongly and foolishly imagine a duality of natures after the union because of the diversity according to substance of the divinity and humanity, from which Emmanuel is constituted.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">With these prior testimonies having been considered without any controversy and placed before the hearers, let us see now how this vigorous Grammarian has arranged the defense for those things which were renewed in Chalcedon. THE GRAMMARIAN: “Let us turn our speech to those who calumniate the holy synod of Chalcedon, and to those who do not say that there are two natures or two substances in Christ. In the first place we will ask them this: The nature, that is, the substance of divinity, is it body or incorporeal? And we will say evidently that it is incorporeal, unless they have fallen from right thoughts. And again we will ask them: What is the nature of flesh? And it appears to all that they will confess it to be body: for it is palpable; but whatever is palpable is body. How then is the Son of God after the economy in one substance, and acknowledged to be in perfect divinity and in perfect humanity?”<sup><a href="#fn65" id="fn65-ref">65</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Again you are concerned with the same ineptitudes and foolish calumnies, which you placed at the beginning in this little book. For which of us will you accuse—as I have often said before—of having thought, that is, of having raved, that the divinity of the Only-begotten and the flesh, which is taken from the God-bearing Virgin Mary and is consubstantial with us and rationally animated and united to the Word Himself, are one substance? And with what snares, from which spider webs are woven, will you entangle them, I ask, with which you certainly imagine to capture them, while not even spiders’ webs endure but immediately because of extreme weakness are broken, not to mention human hands, which do not bear the touch? And perhaps spiders, and by no means rational men, think it decent to fight with such puerile and weak discourses. For divine Scripture somewhere recounts against the Amorites, who were fighting with Israel, that God the Most High armed spiders for the battle, when perhaps He had indicated that the work of warriors would not be worthy against the slaughter of these impious men, and by this very thing taught the Amorites to know their own weakness.<sup><a href="#fn66" id="fn66-ref">66</a></sup> So therefore your foolish and Amorite-like opinions are worthy of spiders, because through impiety they fight against the Israel of God.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For what do you think follows for you at all, as if from irrefutable reasonings, namely from this, that the nature of flesh indeed is palpable, but God the Word does not fall under touch, that Emmanuel is also to be cut apart by me into two natures? Do you think that by irrefutable demonstrations you will lead captive those who contradict you, binding their hands behind their back and forcing them to feel besides what they ought? But know clearly that you have turned aside from the truth and fight vainly as if in the imagination of dreams. For even when by all rightly thinking it is believed that the divinity of the Only-begotten is impalpable and incorporeal, but the flesh is both palpable and solid and consubstantial with us and not destitute of a rational soul, nevertheless, now from two natures, from divinity and humanity perfectly having themselves according to their own reason, one Emmanuel appears and one incarnate nature of God the Word; which, as things opposed to the division of those natures, the Chalcedonian synod did not confess.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore show that the synod confessed these things and do not proceed through vain words, which lack sense and stray from the straight path. But nor let it escape you, often revolving the letter to Succensus, that from two natures one Lord Jesus Christ is proclaimed, and likewise one incarnate nature of God the Word is preached: which are as comprehensive formulae of the ineffable incarnation. These things indeed Saint Cyril demanded and handed down, but the Chalcedonian synod omitted, not indeed ignorant: it knew, indeed with some resisting, but at last yielded on account of the power of impiety. For when the bishops were urged by the princes to put in writing what pleased the time and impiety, they cried out: “Let no one compose another symbol; let those things which were set forth at Nicaea suffice,”<sup><a href="#fn67" id="fn67-ref">67</a></sup> and they brought forward a canon prohibiting any other from being written.<sup><a href="#fn68" id="fn68-ref">68</a></sup> And when necessity still prevailed, they wrote nevertheless, even though contrary to the canon, those things which were consonant with truth; for in no way ought anything small or great to be added to the faith, perfect and entire, as they themselves cried out. However, when they had written, again they were urged to come to another symbol, and those who were applying force did not desist until they cut Christ apart and defined that He exists in two natures.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And since partly among those things which Saint Cyril wrote to Succensus are placed these: CYRIL: “We see two natures conjoined with each other according to the ineffable union unconfusedly and unchangeably: for flesh is flesh and not divinity, even though it has been made God’s flesh, and likewise the Word is God and not flesh, although He has made flesh proper to Himself according to the dispensation. Therefore when we understand this, we say that He is made from two natures without destroying that concurrence into unity; but after the union, we do not divide the natures among themselves, nor do we cut that one and indivisible into two Sons, but we say one Son and, as the Fathers say, one incarnate nature of [God] the Word.”<sup><a href="#fn69" id="fn69-ref">69</a></sup> Explain to us, O cunning defender of the Chalcedonian synod, and you who produce the letters to Succensus by the mere voice of your throat, that through this you may be judged orthodox and simple earthlings, where is the concord of the words of the Chalcedonian synod with Cyril, the most diligent interpreter of divine dogmas; where is it held that “from two natures,” where that “one incarnate nature of God the Word,” as the Fathers said, must be confessed?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">On behalf of these Fathers you burn with zeal; seek fortified words, and not finding them in those things which were written at Chalcedon, acknowledge the fight against truth and do not deceive yourself, while you wander with lies, as it is written in Proverbs,<sup><a href="#fn70" id="fn70-ref">70</a></sup> and forget the paths of your field and go through arid desert; and you fight in vain, when there is no one who comes to hand-to-hand with you; and you seize upon weak attacks, which are dissolved by themselves, as if they were strong; and you think, because the divinity of Emmanuel indeed is incorporeal and spiritual, but the flesh is sensible and falls under touch, that I have given you place for cutting that one indivisible into two natures and defining Him. For from what other reason have you come to foolishly asking: ‘Which of these? Is God palpable, or on the contrary is body intangible?’”</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER SEVEN</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That all heretics who cut the one Christ into two put forward the same insane questions, throwing out the substantial diversity of divinity and humanity as the cause of division.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Diodorus also used the same empty questions and through them paving the way for division, as the wise Cyril brought forward, thus: DIODORUS: “Is He who is from the seed of David from the substance of God? Is not God the Word from the substance of the Father, and He who is from the seed of David, from the substance of David?”<sup><a href="#fn71" id="fn71-ref">71</a></sup> What then did the herald of truth say to these, spreading out the cause of such frigid questions, which is section? CYRIL: “And so, even though from the substance of the Father truly is that which is from Him, the Word; even though from the seed of David is the flesh, and both are true—for it is true, and we in no way deny it; even though we do not remove the Only-begotten from the substance of God and the Father, nor again the flesh from the substance of David; nevertheless we know that the divine evangelist John wrote manifestly: ‘And the Word became flesh.’<sup><a href="#fn72" id="fn72-ref">72</a></sup> But He became flesh, not changed into flesh—for He has a nature superior to change—but when He united that flesh to Himself ineffably, so that one Son is acknowledged and called Jesus Christ the Lord, not indeed, as Diodorus said, that He joined to Himself a certain servant, altogether cutting Him also into a duality of sons.”<sup><a href="#fn73" id="fn73-ref">73</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But he wisely meets Nestorius also hastening to duality by the same empty and by all recognized questions and thence thinking that he would prepare the economy’s division and separation of union, and in the third tome against his polluted blasphemies he closes his ways thus: CYRIL: “Why therefore do you violently take away the wisdom of the economy, so that it seems that we must be ashamed of things well done, through that which you say: ‘Is the divinity the seed of Abraham? According to divinity, did He have brothers like Himself?’ Is not this open madness? For to question ineptly and to thrust down to blasphemy those things which are so right and immaculate, as pertains to the reason of the economy understood in Christ, what else is it but the demonstration of worst madness?”<sup><a href="#fn74" id="fn74-ref">74</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Moreover in the fifth tome against the same Nestorius, to him hastening to that division which he followed by common arguments and also, as your wisdom says, “For divinity is not investigated by touch,”<sup><a href="#fn75" id="fn75-ref">75</a></sup> he applies medicines which heal those insane questions: CYRIL: “But, unless the Word had become palpable and visible, as having a body subject to touch and sight, how did the most wise disciples become spectators of the Word? How moreover do they say that they have seen and handled the Word of life, which was with the Father and appeared to us?”<sup><a href="#fn76" id="fn76-ref">76</a></sup> This same one therefore, palpable and visible, this one who had been nailed to the wood, when Thomas recognized Him, confesses, and most rightly indeed, as God and Lord; for he said immediately: ‘My Lord and my God.’<sup><a href="#fn77" id="fn77-ref">77</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">These things we also will respond to your cold and invincible question; and if you press, because we confess one Christ and one incarnate nature of the Word and therefore you flee to calumny and charge us with some mixture and effusion of flesh into divinity, as if we think, foolishly and as can in no way happen, that both are one substance, you have indeed above copiously placed those things which utterly remove this vain suspicion.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But because you exhibit the letters of Cyril to Succensus as a certain shield to frighten your adversaries, just as those who stand in a ship for appearance, and standing you stand, we will not reject you as throwing away a shield, but we enclose so that you may carry this same shield before you and protected by it rush upon yourself and cast the darts of calumny. For I will bring forward into the midst those things which are in the middle and strongest part of that shield, even though they do not exceed the mode, which would call the whole shield similar to iron, which is placed in the middle of the shield: for from no part can it happen that through it passes the dart of adversaries. Nevertheless read these with the eyes of your mind and cease always to recite the same calumny: CYRIL: “For not only concerning those things which are simple according to nature is ‘one’ truly said, but also concerning those things which are gathered according to composition, of which sort is man from soul and body. For such things are diverse according to species and in no way consubstantial with each other; but where they are united, they absolve one nature of man, although in the reason of composition there is present difference according to the nature of those things which are brought to unity. Superfluously therefore speak those who say, if there is one incarnate nature of the Word, it altogether and entirely follows that confusion and commixture have been made, as if the nature of humanity were diminished and taken away. For it is neither diminished, nor, as they say, taken away; for it suffices for the fullest demonstration of this, that He was made man, to say: ‘He was incarnate.’ For if this were kept silent by us, their calumny would have some place; but when it is necessarily added by us, where is the mode of diminution or subtraction?”<sup><a href="#fn78" id="fn78-ref">78</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">How therefore, O good man, did you consider as nothing those things which show you how those things from which Emmanuel is are not commingled into one and the same substance, and as unskilled and ridiculous physicians you of your own accord approach those who are healthy, when they drive you away from their doors, and you afflict the sacred words of Cyril with reproaches, applying them inopportunely, and from those very letters to Succensus you proclaim to us that it cannot be that that body from earth suffers mutation into divinity? And so as those who labor with insanity, [where] in the impulse which drives them they become and are led by it and are wholly given over to the insanity which holds them, they cannot return to themselves, so also you, except that not without your will, as they, but altogether by your will, restraining the prior impulse, you protract your speech in vain and as if a matter in controversy you demonstrate that which is in agreement, that is, that created and uncreated, made and not made, subject to time and timeless, are not the same according to substance. And when there is no one who disputes about it, you bring forward a multitude of testimonies of the holy Fathers. To which it pleases and befits to say to you that which was said by a certain prophet: ‘Woe to him who multiplies for himself what is not his; how long? and who burdens his pledge heavily, because suddenly there will rise up those biting him.’<sup><a href="#fn79" id="fn79-ref">79</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">How long indeed shall we bear you vainly strengthening these bonds, lest we rise up and bite you with those very things which are written to Succensus: which are twisted by your hands, fall vainly from your mouth and as rising up against you, bite you with strong bites, so that they afflict even your stupor, and they cry out to you, when you ask: ‘Which of these? Is the intangible the same as the tangible, and that which falls under sense the same as the spiritual?’: CYRIL: ‘For such things indeed are diverse according to species, and in no way consubstantial with each other; but where they are united, they absolve one nature of man, although in the reason of composition there is present natural difference of those things which are brought to unity. Superfluously therefore speak those who say, if there is one incarnate nature of God the Word, it altogether and entirely follows that confusion and commixture have been made, as if the nature of man were diminished and taken away. For it is neither diminished, nor, as they say, taken away; for it suffices for the fullest demonstration of this, that He was made man, to say: “He was incarnate.” For if we were silent about this, their calumny would have some place; but when it is necessarily added, where is the mode of diminution or subtraction?’”<sup><a href="#fn80" id="fn80-ref">80</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But similarly also the words of the sacred herald and apostle and bishop of the church of the Romans, Julius, where they are adduced, will bite you. For such are the spiritual bites of rational dogs, who from unclean gentiles and as if from dogs are designated by the grace of God and vigilantly watch over the flock of Christ our Savior and bark against every alien and lying voice: whose tongue, when time demanded, was often dipped in the noble blood of confession of martyrdom, as David sings;<sup><a href="#fn81" id="fn81-ref">81</a></sup> and when they thus honored the divine blood, which redeemed us all from sin, truly they were dipped and were lifted up to the imitation of those eight bites, which the wise Micah foretold,<sup><a href="#fn82" id="fn82-ref">82</a></sup> raised up against the spiritual Assyrian, that is, against Satan. These indeed were certainly the mouths of the divine apostles, who signified the power of the eighth because of the resurrection; and they confirmed that resurrection with testimonies of the prophets, who had fed Israel and through the seventh and sabbatical union of the law had been led to be, and had foretold the evangelical institution of the eighth and Lord’s day through legal types; by whom the strong one was bound, according to the word of the Savior,<sup><a href="#fn83" id="fn83-ref">83</a></sup> that is, Satan, who had invaded us, his vessels were taken away from the Jews and from the gentiles; for Micah foretold that there would rise up against him seven shepherds and eight bites of men.<sup><a href="#fn84" id="fn84-ref">84</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But it is time to hear the bites of Julius, who, in the oration which is titled: “On the union in Christ of the body to the divinity of God the Word,” wrote thus: JULIUS: “But it is proclaimed in Him that this indeed is created in union with the uncreated, but that is uncreated in conjunction with the created, one nature subsisting from both parts, fulfilling also particular operation for the Word with the divine perfection: which in common man from two imperfect parts is done, and perfecting one nature and designated by one name, because flesh also is called the whole, the soul not being taken away, and the whole soul is called, the body not being taken away, although there is something else besides the soul. God therefore is incarnate, the Lord higher than human generation even though born from a woman; and He is Lord, even though conformed to servants; and He is spirit, even though also flesh—while demonstrating the union of flesh, He is not man, as Paul said;<sup><a href="#fn85" id="fn85-ref">85</a></sup> although man is preached by Him—and, to speak absolutely, invisible God transformed in a visible body, uncreated God manifested in a created covering, emptying Himself indeed according to the form of a servant,<sup><a href="#fn86" id="fn86-ref">86</a></sup> but in no way emptied nor changed nor diminished according to the divine substance; for no change is had concerning the divine nature, nor is it diminished nor increased.”<sup><a href="#fn87" id="fn87-ref">87</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">When you have heard these things, will you bring forth your ridiculous questions to him who wrote these, and sharply ask him whether the same according to substance is created as uncreated and visible the same as invisible? However—which satisfied your ridiculous questions—you had heard how, in Christ, this indeed uncreated, but that created, in conjunction and in union is proclaimed and acknowledged, one nature subsisting from both, and one incarnate hypostasis of God the Word. For they are not of one and the same substance, as you, drunk in these calumnies, hide and number yourself among those of whom the divine one among the prophets Amos said: “And they drank wine from calumnies in the house of their God.”<sup><a href="#fn88" id="fn88-ref">88</a></sup> For this is the most serious drunkenness, namely that in the house of God, in the Church, you hide those things by which, for the faithful and those who are not exercised in such things, the tempter, turning them away from sound faith as much as you can, you become. If indeed you were to narrate something from your grammatical instructions, I would wholly keep silence, according to the counsel of the most wise Paul saying: “For what is it to me to judge those who are outside?”<sup><a href="#fn89" id="fn89-ref">89</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER EIGHT</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That it is the same, among the orthodox doctors, both to confess one incarnate nature of God the Word, and to say that Christ is one nature, that is, one hypostasis, composed from divinity and from humanity without confusion.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But, because you anxiously strive to mock ecclesiastical dogmas and thought it would be advantageous for you to ask us, who think rightly, whether we confess that created and uncreated appear in Him, we direct to you the apostolic words of Julius, who said: JULIUS: “It is proclaimed in Him that this indeed is created in union with the uncreated, but that is uncreated in conjunction with the created, one nature subsisting from both parts.”<sup><a href="#fn90" id="fn90-ref">90</a></sup> For from the uncreated and created, and from the conjunction of both and union to confess one nature without confusion, is the same as to say one incarnate nature of God the Word.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For thus we find Saint Cyril also to have written against Andrew’s reprehension of the eighth anathema the words which I placed above; which are thus: CYRIL: “For since concerning one person and nature or one hypostasis, considering from which things it is or is composed naturally, he subjoins the preposition ‘with’ or ‘with,’ he preserves even thus that the thing signified is one according to composition, and defines it as in no way to be divided into two.”<sup><a href="#fn91" id="fn91-ref">91</a></sup> And the same I produced also in the book which is titled “That Christ is One” thus saying: CYRIL: “Therefore we say that there is one Son and one nature of His, even though He is acknowledged to have been made in the assumption of flesh having a rational soul. For His, as I said, the humanity was made; but it is conceived by us not otherwise than in this manner God simultaneously and man.”<sup><a href="#fn92" id="fn92-ref">92</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">These things I said, not as if for the destruction and negation of the inspired word of the Fathers, which teaches to confess that there is one incarnate nature of God the Word—for this more, so to speak, than breath we need, holding it as holy and safe and firm—but to make known to the hearers the concord of the doctors, namely that according to them it is the same both to say one incarnate nature of God the Word, and to confess that Christ is one composite nature, or to assert one nature of the Son, who was made in the assumption of flesh having a rational soul. These things you ought to have considered, O vigorous one, if concerning the created and uncreated, which concurred to the natural union, you had wished to know with the sight of a subtle eye the absence simultaneously of confusion and division; and likewise you ought not negligently to have read the words of the wise Cyril, which indeed are found in the second letter to Succensus, but signify how the ineffable union is free from confusion, and shows indeed to those who consider it with subtle eyes of mind and with subtle contemplation only, that there are two things which have been gathered, but immediately expels duality, because with the diversity of those things which are united, there concurs that one thing which according to composition is absolved, so that those things which are separated only by the phantasy of intellect, now do not appear two, because they do not subsist properly and singularly, but because from both unchanged, even where they are composed, remaining, the intellect sees one nature and one hypostasis. And these are the words: CYRIL: “But let man like to us be again for us an example. For we understand two natures also concerning him, indeed one of soul, but another of body. But separating by mere thoughts and apprehending the difference by subtle contemplations or phantasies of intellect, we do not place the natures separately, nor again do we allow the power of section perfectly upon them, but we understand them to be one, so that those two natures are now not two, but from both one animal is absolved.”<sup><a href="#fn93" id="fn93-ref">93</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Thus therefore you also concerning Emmanuel, according to the power of the example placed, consider those things from which He is and is composed; and you will see that there are plainly two, divinity and humanity, and separating them by mere thoughts and in a certain way apprehending the difference by subtle contemplations and phantasies of intellect, you will not place the natures separately: for they do not subsist separately and properly, nor in singular proper subsistences. Therefore those two things, from which union is had, composed without confusion, are separated by intellect alone. For they are in no way changed, nor are they also two in hypostases, but from both one hypostasis is absolved, and one person, and one incarnate nature of God the Word.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">How therefore, when you are commanded to separate by mere thoughts that which is indivisibly united, and in a certain way to apprehend the difference by subtle contemplations or phantasies of intellect, do you remain in duality and say two natures after the union, just as also the Chalcedonian synod, of which you have appeared to us a new and voluntary patron?</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER NINE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>Reprehension of the impious, who disapproving the saying of Gregory the Wonderworker, say and define two natures and one Christ, as if fabricating a calumny.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Nor have you obeyed Gregory the Wonderworker, decreeing and statuting manifestly to confess that Christ is two natures is to convert the Trinity into a quaternity, even though the wise Basil, in those things which he wrote concerning the Holy Spirit to Amphilochius, indicated that his words are worthy to be placed with the words of the apostles.<sup><a href="#fn94" id="fn94-ref">94</a></sup> For while he expounds and unfolds to us and proceeds step by step to explain the word of sound faith—which work he therefore inscribed—that saint, who obtained a name for truth, because he excels in the charismata of divine miracles—but indeed also of dogmas—says these things: GREGORY OF NEOCAESAREA: “And He is true God, manifested in flesh without experience of flesh, perfect with true and divine perfection, not two persons nor two natures; for we do not say that we adore four, God and the Son of God and man and the Holy Spirit. Therefore we also anathematize those who so impiously act, those who place man in the divine doxology. For we say that the Word of God was made man for our salvation, that we might receive the likeness of the heavenly and become deified to the likeness of Him according to the nature of the true Son of God, but according to flesh of the Son of man our Lord Jesus Christ.”<sup><a href="#fn95" id="fn95-ref">95</a></sup> Behold these things indeed the herald of truth and apostolic doctor; but I have learned that Your Prudence, as some have narrated to me, from much erudition in divine dogmas, disputes and says that these words are not of Gregory, but are adulterated and changed. And you give this sign, namely that indeed in this exposition of faith by parts it is found that the Son is consubstantial with the Father, but no one before the 318 holy Fathers ever used this word. What therefore shall we say to this? First indeed it would have behooved you, reading the encomium, that is, the life of him preserved by Saint Gregory, bishop of Nyssa, and finding there that the faith was revealed to the Wonderworker from the tongue of John the evangelist and theologian—in which is had: “Nor is there anything created or servile in the Trinity, nor adventitious, which first indeed was not, but afterwards was introduced”<sup><a href="#fn96" id="fn96-ref">96</a></sup>—to give acknowledgment that he who had learned these things, when in the revelation there appeared to him the evangelist, and also the Virgin God-bearer, and commanded the faith to be spoken to him, where he was about to teach Pontus and Cappadocia and, through those regions, the whole world, had both held in mind and said that the holy Trinity is consubstantial. For how would he not have been prompt to profess this, who does not admit anything created or adventitious in that Trinity and consequently knew and expressly had heard from those who had spoken to him that the Trinity is perfect, in glory and eternity and kingdom, neither divided nor dissident? Then, go, if you wish, into the aforesaid regions and from the churches which are there, you will learn the exposition of faith by parts, together with the other doctrines of the great Gregory.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But that artifice Saint Athanasius manifestly made void with express words in those things which he wrote to the bishops established in Africa; which are thus: ATHANASIUS: “But the bishops did not invent words for themselves, but having testimony from the Fathers, they wrote thus. For former bishops, nearly thirty years before, of great Rome and of our city, blamed those who said that the Son is a creature and not consubstantial with the Father.”<sup><a href="#fn97" id="fn97-ref">97</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This also Eusebius, who was bishop of Caesarea, knew. Who first indeed resisted the heresies of the Arians, but afterwards subscribed to the Nicene synod. For he wrote to his fellow citizens, asserting: “We know also that certain illustrious and learned bishops among the ancients and likewise writers about the divinity of the Father and the Son used the word of consubstantiality.”<sup><a href="#fn98" id="fn98-ref">98</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">How therefore, while you act deceitfully against such manifest things, do you think you will escape the judgment of God and from Him who catches the wise in their craftiness, as Paul says?<sup><a href="#fn99" id="fn99-ref">99</a></sup> Have you not heard David singing against you and saying concerning your like: “They said: The Lord will not see, nor will the God of Jacob understand;” to whom moreover he says: “The Lord knows the thoughts of men, that they are vain.”<sup><a href="#fn100" id="fn100-ref">100</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">However, let us grant that these are not of Gregory, as you say. For why are we helped by these words only? Have we not placed before akin and concordant and similar sayings which Cyril and Julius, apostolic men and distinguished doctors, said? What aid therefore arises for you from machinations and from persuasive, nay not persuasive, fabrications, when you are refuted by many witnesses saying the same things with the same sentiments and words?</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TEN</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>Disputation against those who presume to impiously machinate and to say that to say "one Christ" is the same as "one incarnate nature of God the Word" and "two united natures," from the apostolic words of Athanasius.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">To these let also the bright Star of the church of the Alexandrians, Athanasius, come, about whom, I think, the apostles would not have cast lots, if they set before themselves to number someone among the twelve crowns: for they would find no one who would be compared to him, to know by lot who should be preferred, as they did concerning Matthias and Joseph, who was called Justus, when they wished to fill the place of Judas, who fell.<sup><a href="#fn101" id="fn101-ref">101</a></sup> So copious and abundant in the same Spirit as they he lived, and he died daily,<sup><a href="#fn102" id="fn102-ref">102</a></sup> bearing in himself the mortification of Jesus<sup><a href="#fn103" id="fn103-ref">103</a></sup> and not suffering to be at rest, indeed easily neglecting his own blood, but never letting go even one iota or one apex from the word of piety,<sup><a href="#fn104" id="fn104-ref">104</a></sup> according to the word of the Lord,<sup><a href="#fn105" id="fn105-ref">105</a></sup> when he considered that this kingdom of heaven would be shut before him.<sup><a href="#fn106" id="fn106-ref">106</a></sup> Wherefore also with best right Gregory the Theologian called his dogmas the law of orthodoxy.<sup><a href="#fn107" id="fn107-ref">107</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">He therefore, such a herald of piety, in the writings on the incarnation of the Word, wrote thus: ATHANASIUS: “We confess Him to be the Son of God and God according to spirit, but the Son of man according to flesh: not two natures one Son, one to be adored and the other not to be adored, but one incarnate nature of God the Word and to be adored with one adoration with His flesh, nor two Sons, one indeed the true and adorable Son of God, the other from Mary a man not to be adored, made Son of God by grace, as men, but Him from God, as I said, one Son of God and God, Himself, and not another, also born from Mary according to flesh in the end of days, as to the God-bearing Mary saying: ‘How shall this be, since I do not know man?’ the Angel said: ‘The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also that which is born holy shall be called the Son of God.’”<sup><a href="#fn108" id="fn108-ref">108</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What could anyone show clearer than these definitions and manifest laws of an indubitable matter, which define that one incarnate nature of God the Word is to be proclaimed and adored, having first absolutely decreed by reprobation: “Not two natures one Son, one to be adored and one not to be adored.” For duality dissolves the union and by all necessity human nature is reduced to this, that it is not adored, when by the section of duality it is separated from God the Word according to nature to be adored.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">“But,” the adversary will say, “I say unity of natures! But it is the same to say ‘two united natures’ and ‘one composite nature.’” But attend, O good man, how the Doctor absolutely decreed: “Not two natures one Son.”<sup><a href="#fn109" id="fn109-ref">109</a></sup> For union according to nature and according to hypostasis effects that we say “one incarnate nature of God the Word,” but not, by a mere play of words, persuasion: “two united natures.” “For how from conjunction unconfusedly effected from two natures would it ever follow that we again say ‘two natures’? This can in no way be, and is altogether impossible. For if this were possible, the wise Athanasius would not have said without any exception: ‘Not two natures one Son,’ but would have manifestly said: ‘Not two separated natures one Son, but two individual and united natures.’ They are not the words of Athanasius: for he knew, having Christ speaking in him, that He who is composed from two is not two, but He is one according to hypostasis. Although, where by subtle contemplation alone our intellect prepares, it sees those two things which come together into one, divinity and humanity; nevertheless, as soon as we separate by thought and acknowledge the difference according to nature of those things which are united into one, the thought of union shows the one who is composed from two, and does not permit the intellect to remain in the separation made according to thought.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And this is what Saint Cyril says to Nestorius, in the second tome against his blasphemies: “Cease dividing the natures after the union,”<sup><a href="#fn110" id="fn110-ref">110</a></sup> that is, after the thought of union. For when, he says, by subtle separation alone you know, O you, that there are two things which are conjoined—for this union is a conjunction of two or many things; for to say that one is united to itself is subtle—do not now imagine according to hypostasis: for from two there is one hypostasis and the incarnate nature of the Word. For if he had permitted, after the thought of union, two natures to be proclaimed or said, Saint Cyril would not have said, in the second letter to Succensus: CYRIL: “so that those two natures are now not two, but each, one animal is absolved,”<sup><a href="#fn111" id="fn111-ref">111</a></sup> when he assumed man like us as an example of the ineffable union which is in Emmanuel, we acknowledge. But neither did Athanasius remain, without any exception, as we said before, decree: “Not two natures one Christ.”<sup><a href="#fn112" id="fn112-ref">112</a></sup> For it is necessary to know only the difference of those things which are united, but to reject, after the thought of union, the section of duality. For thus somewhere Saint Cyril says, in the second tome of what he wrote against the blasphemies of Nestorius: CYRILLUS: “For I too concede that there is the greatest distance and difference between humanity and divinity: for they are diverse as pertains to the reason of the mode of being, and nothing similar among themselves seem those things which are indicated by these names.<sup><a href="#fn113" id="fn113-ref">113</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But when that mystery concerning Christ is brought forth into our midst, the reason of union indeed does not ignore the difference, but excludes division: not that it confuses or mixes the natures among themselves, but that the Word of God made partaker of blood and flesh is again understood and called one Son in this way.”</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER ELEVEN</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That one must confess the divinity and humanity, which are diverse according to substance, from which the one Christ is, and flee "the section of duality after the union"; and that it is not the same to say "one Christ from two natures" as to impiously say He is known "in two natures."</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Indeed, up to considering the difference according to nature of those things which are gathered into one, it is permitted to separate by subtle intellect those two from which the natural union is absolved; but to dwell further on the separation leads us into two persons and into two sons. Since Nestorius confessed these, he did not refuse to present two natures as united. And immediately behold the wise and prudent Cyril! In the prosphonetic oration to the most pious emperor Theodosius he says thus: CYRIL: “Not distinguishing the nature of the Word and the flesh, nor willing to stand in the differences pertaining to this alone; for they would not thus stray from the true opinion, since the nature of flesh and of divinity is not the same; but establishing one, namely as man, properly and singly, and calling the other according to nature and truth God, even though willing themselves to be Christians.”<sup><a href="#fn114" id="fn114-ref">114</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, up to acknowledging the difference of those things which are conjoined, he concedes that someone in subtle contemplative exercises separates the things which are united. But if he remains in duality after the union, so that he says that this one according to hypostasis is two natures, with the purpose that he establishes man singly and God separately: Cyril exhibits those who would confess thus. For “the union indeed does not ignore difference, but excludes division,” as we have learned the Doctor said.<sup><a href="#fn115" id="fn115-ref">115</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But how shall we flee division? When we shall say “from two natures,” but not “two natures” after the union. For again we have heard him say: “Cease dividing the natures after the union.”<sup><a href="#fn116" id="fn116-ref">116</a></sup> Moreover, in the same prosphonetic oration he says: CYRIL: “Confessing one and the same Son, shown ineffably from two things into one, that is, from two things, according to the highest union, but not according to conversion of natures.”<sup><a href="#fn117" id="fn117-ref">117</a></sup> For everywhere he preaches Emmanuel to be “from two natures,” nowhere finally “in two natures,” as was diligently determined by the definitive sentence of the Chalcedonians: “for these are they who separate themselves, animal, not having the Spirit,”<sup><a href="#fn118" id="fn118-ref">118</a></sup> as also indeed someone writing from the apostles says.<sup><a href="#fn119" id="fn119-ref">119</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But if not, show, O most open mouth of grammarians, where the excellent Cyril said this, who was greatly versed in this question and refuted the sophisms which are found in the words of those who divide the one Christ, and everywhere brought forth the formula “from two natures,” as dissipating duality and effecting that one nature—of God the Word incarnate—and one hypostasis and one person be acknowledged.<sup><a href="#fn120" id="fn120-ref">120</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">How therefore, in your lamentable little book, do you present that formula as confessed upside down, and also Saint Cyril himself, thus inspiring fear in simpler people, and say these things about him: THE GRAMMARIAN: “but he teaches manifestly that there is held no difference at all whether someone says one incarnate nature of God the Word or confesses Emmanuel in two natures inseparably united.”<sup><a href="#fn121" id="fn121-ref">121</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Show therefore, O most bold and unlearned, that Cyril defined Emmanuel “in two natures.” Or know yourself clearly to be ascribed by the Apostle Paul to those about whom writing to Timothy he said: “not understanding either what they say or about what they assert.”<sup><a href="#fn122" id="fn122-ref">122</a></sup> But neither let this escape you: that the Nestorians, namely your followers and imitators, laboring with the disease of duality after the ineffable union, and thus cutting the inseparable and indivisible, armed against the truth with many deceits and tricks, composed a book, thinking that it would patronize their own evil opinion. They divided that book into two hundred forty-four chapters, excerpting passages, so to speak, from all the writings of Saint Cyril and impiously dividing them into parts, in which they were convicted of having interwoven this phrase, I say the formula “in two natures,” into the words of the Doctor, since they were lacking testimonies from everywhere and therefore proceeded to impudent false accusations, just as also you contend that this phrase is of the wise Cyril, which is not his. Thus indeed stands the fabricated chapter from the prosphonetic to the most pious emperor Theodosius: CYRIL: “And He is as perfect in divinity, so also perfect in humanity, not composed into one Christ and Son and Lord from divinity and flesh alone, but in two perfect things—I say divinity and humanity—wonderfully united into one and the same.”<sup><a href="#fn123" id="fn123-ref">123</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, the fabrication of those, which adulterated the passage, promoting and defending the formula “in two,” is that which declares, so to speak, and utters the phrase and at the same time refutes the impiety and ignorance of those who wrote the fiction by force. But he made a defense, not because he acknowledged that Saint Cyril needed defense in any way, but armed his discourse against calumniators and falsifiers, who made the meaning and arrangement of the discourse, as much as they could, limping, since they had adulterated many of his books, so that not even to those willing was it easy to find the genuine book openly in the royal city then. But the things which were written by me to that chapter sound thus: From PHILALETHES. DEFENSE TO THIS CHAPTER: “Here again they manifestly changed the genuine book. For they changed the words ‘from two perfect things’ into the words ‘in two perfect things.’ And first indeed, all books, so to speak, which escaped the hand of this falsifier and those similar to him, refute the wickedness, because the very arrangement of the discourse rises up against the calumniator. For if it had been in the text: ‘in two perfect things,’ Cyril would not have said: ‘not from divinity and flesh alone composed into one Christ and Lord and Son,’<sup><a href="#fn124" id="fn124-ref">124</a></sup> but on the contrary: ‘in divinity and flesh alone.’ And the word ‘composed’ manifestly shows one from two; but the formula ‘in two’ gives indication of two certain things subsisting singly and separately. But the calumny is refuted also from these things which Saint Cyril continues: OF SAINT CYRIL, AFTER A FEW SENTENCES OF HIS CHAPTERS, FROM THE SAME PROSPHONETIC ORATION: ‘And indeed the divine Paul, gathering into one according to the dispensation those things which are much distant from consubstantiality and removed from each other by immense difference, divinity and humanity, and signifying from both one Christ and Son and God, says: “Paul, servant of Jesus Christ, called apostle, separated for the gospel of God.”’<sup><a href="#fn125" id="fn125-ref">125</a></sup> But to those who aid the impiety of Nestorius, the formula ‘from two’ is adverse; as indicative indeed of hypostatic union, but destructive of section into two—who only fictitiously speak of union of two natures, that they may find for themselves a union of affection—from the unclean words of Nestorius it appears. OF IMPIOUS NESTORIUS, FROM THE LETTER TO THEODORET IN WHICH HE REPREHENDS THOSE THINGS WHICH WERE WRITTEN BY CYRIL TO THE ORIENTALS: ‘For what does he say: “although the difference of natures is not ignored, from which we say the ineffable union was made?” That again “from which,” as if concerning parts corresponding to each other, he says two natures, which have passed into one. For it ought to have been said by him not “from which” but “of which” we say the ineffable union was made. For the union is not from natures, but of the natures.’<sup><a href="#fn126" id="fn126-ref">126</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore these things then, acting as defender, I wrote to those who fabricate similar things and calumniate; but now I write the same against the falsehood and your unlearned boldness; which clearly show to hearers that you never cease, having the spirit of error, to leap here and there like scorpions and fix the poisonous sting of calumny into healthy words and dogmas.<sup><a href="#fn127" id="fn127-ref">127</a></sup> But you will afflict with no harm those who are learned, and who are not ignorant of those things which pertain to divine dogmas.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">How indeed did you dare, when you had mixed the cup of calumny for the unlearned, nay rather had drunk unmixed bold impiety, to write these things about Saint Cyril: THE GRAMMARIAN: “but he teaches manifestly that there is held no difference at all whether someone says one incarnate nature of God the Word or confesses Emmanuel in two natures inseparably united,”<sup><a href="#fn128" id="fn128-ref">128</a></sup> when the Doctor, who is afflicted by calumny, wrote, if it may be said, more clearly and shiningly and more evidently, in the second letter to Succensus, that the assertion of two natures indivisible is adverse to the confession of one incarnate nature of God the Word? For he brings forward, as if from the proposition of heretics, who think the same as you, in that very letter, these things ignorantly tossed about through mere persuasion of words, which he thus inscribes as if on a pillar in these words: CYRIL: “I find indeed that there is nothing else which they seek. For he who says that the Lord suffered in bare flesh makes the passion irrational and not spontaneous. But if someone says that He suffered with a rational soul, that the passion may be spontaneous, nothing prohibits that He be said to have suffered in the nature of humanity. If this is true, how shall we not concede that two natures subsist after the union indivisibly? Therefore, if someone says ‘Christ therefore suffered for us in flesh,’<sup><a href="#fn129" id="fn129-ref">129</a></sup> he says nothing else than ‘Christ therefore suffered for us in our nature.’”<sup><a href="#fn130" id="fn130-ref">130</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Behold how manifestly he said the proposition of two natures subsisting without division, and confesses Christ existing in them as if in order to have suffered in our nature. Attend therefore how the solution of that proposition decrees that the assertion “in two natures indivisible” is incited and fights diametrically against this confession of one incarnate nature of God the Word, and stands against those who frequently repeat the same foolish words.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And the same he very often cries out, and never grows weary. For what does he say: CYRIL: “It is adverse again and no less the proposition to those who say that one is the incarnate nature of the Son. And wishing to show that inept, they everywhere try to show two natures subsisting.”<sup><a href="#fn131" id="fn131-ref">131</a></sup> But the Grammarian, when in a certain place towards the end of that lamentable little book he appended these sentences, thus wrote—nay, he disseminated fables of impiety, that he might escape correction, and many times chewed the same and like a bull ate hay, as divine Scripture says somewhere,<sup><a href="#fn132" id="fn132-ref">132</a></sup> those things which we can simultaneously gather and like vain chaff collect and burn with the flame of persuasive confutations: THE GRAMMARIAN: “For he says likewise Cyril: ‘They try everywhere to show two natures subsisting,’ evidently, two natures separated.”<sup><a href="#fn133" id="fn133-ref">133</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Who would not be astounded at a man so bold? He has come to voluntary injustice, for which there is accordingly no remission! For when the Doctor first placed: the proposition of those saying that two natures subsist indivisible and contending against them said: “They try everywhere to show two natures subsisting,”<sup><a href="#fn134" id="fn134-ref">134</a></sup> the Grammarian says: THE GRAMMARIAN: “Evidently, two natures separated.”<sup><a href="#fn135" id="fn135-ref">135</a></sup> O wonderful explanation! Behold, you have subtly explained even our words. And when he wrote to Nephalius: “We are one thing and one nature both together,”<sup><a href="#fn136" id="fn136-ref">136</a></sup> that is, soul and body: for this is man, one according to nature, that is, according to hypostasis, who is acknowledged the same according to substance,<sup><a href="#fn137" id="fn137-ref">137</a></sup> you have violently and boldly and foolishly handled my words. And when Saint Cyril, to those who insisted: “How shall we not concede that two natures subsist after the union indivisibly?”<sup><a href="#fn138" id="fn138-ref">138</a></sup> said in those very words that they are adverse to those who say one incarnate nature of the Son, and wishing to show that inept, everywhere try to show two natures subsisting, you boldly oppose him as if against those who say separated natures he wrote these things, and by force wish to delete those things which are written, by means of an unscriptural and rash explanation.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Now perhaps also Isaiah cries: “The fool will speak foolishly and his heart will contrive vanities, to accomplish iniquity and speak error against the Lord.”<sup><a href="#fn139" id="fn139-ref">139</a></sup> But let a certain wise man also say with the prophet: “The explanation of a fool is like a burden on the way,”<sup><a href="#fn140" id="fn140-ref">140</a></sup> and: “Weep over the dead: for light has been taken away from him; and weep over the fool: for wisdom has been taken away from him.”<sup><a href="#fn141" id="fn141-ref">141</a></sup> For how are these not worthy of tears: that those who have spent all their age in explaining to boys the songs in Homer, and perhaps not very successfully performed that task, rush with the cloak of ignorance, with unwashed feet, as it is said, into divine things and explain them perversely, nay rather calumniate the doctrines of the pious doctors, and treat unwritten things as if written and said by them, but pass over written things as if silent?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And if only they would pass over and not add things contrary to those which are manifestly placed, by means of calumnious and bold and impudent explanations! But you, according to the proverb, if you strike a fool with insults in the midst of the council, you will not take away his folly.<sup><a href="#fn142" id="fn142-ref">142</a></sup> For when the wise Doctor in the cited passages said that the assertion of two natures indivisible is adverse to the confession of one incarnate nature of God the Word, the Grammarian, new reconciler and mediator of opposing words, again says: THE GRAMMARIAN: “Wow, the boldness of adversaries! For if we only said two natures, and did not also add the other confession, namely that there is one incarnate nature of God the Word, perhaps they would have a blameless cause.”<sup><a href="#fn143" id="fn143-ref">143</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What shall we do, O wise one? For I will recite the same about your impudent contention, which also Saint Cyril, who decreed that those two formulas are adverse to each other, namely, to say two natures individual and united after the union, and to think and confess that there is one incarnate nature of God the Word; and those who say two natures signify that it is vain and useless to confess one nature. For the union and that one from two, through the dispensational and unconfused conjunction, duality dissolves. For if it were permitted to confess Christ in two natures indivisible, as you say, after the ineffable union, Saint Cyril would not have decreed that we separate by contemplation alone those things from which the union was made, nor that we understand indeed that there are two things which are gathered, but by the thought of union run to the formula “one from two,” and then after the thought of union say “two” by no means. For to you the Doctor manifestly cries, as already said above: “Cease dividing the natures after the union.”<sup><a href="#fn144" id="fn144-ref">144</a></sup> For those who are separated according to hypostasis, for example Peter and Paul, no one says are separated in contemplation only—for they are both separated in hypostases, and each of them is in his own hypostasis, and by diversity of singularity they are perfectly and separately distant from each other. But one man, for example Peter, subsisting from soul and body and existing in one hypostasis, someone separates in contemplation alone, when he considers those things from which he is, and by intellect alone apprehends that there has been a natural concurrence of two certain things to the constitution of one living being; but when he meditates the union together with the separation, which had appeared in subtle thought, now he cannot, after the thought of the union itself, call those two things which appeared, two: for one hypostasis is from two, but not every singular subsists in the property of subsistence, so that two be numbered after the union.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And see how manifestly these words of the Doctor show—Cyril—but those things escape them which are accustomed to be separated not by contemplation alone, but also in perfect diversity to stand separately and singly distant from each other. But let man like us be again for us an example. For we understand two natures also concerning him, indeed one of soul, but another of body. But discerning by mere thoughts and apprehending the difference by subtle contemplations and phantasies of intellect, we do not place the natures separately, nor again do we allow perfectly the power of section upon them, but we understand them to be one, so that those two natures are now not two, but from both one animal is absolved.<sup><a href="#fn145" id="fn145-ref">145</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What could be clearer than these liberal words, which indeed concede that we separate this one subsisting from two by mere thoughts and subtle contemplations and even phantasies of intellect, until we acknowledge the difference of those among themselves not consubstantial but gathered into natural union, but prohibit that we remain in separation and say “two” this one according to hypostasis, as duality drawing into perfect section. For what does he also say? “So that those two natures are now not two, but from both one animal is absolved.” And see, I ask, the diligence of the wise Doctor. For he did not say “so that those two natures are now not”—for this would be diminution, which follows from the confession of truth—but he said: “are now not two.”<sup><a href="#fn146" id="fn146-ref">146</a></sup> For although they exist in composition and perfect that one in no diminished way, they are prohibited by the union, which perfects one hypostasis from two, from being two and subsisting and numbered in singular proper subsistences.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Why therefore are you compelled to say “two,” when the Doctor cried out that they are now by no means two? For if he had agreed with your foolish words, he ought to have said fittingly: “Therefore now there are not two natures separated, but individual or united.” No doubt because he also who had objected the proposition had said: “How shall we not concede that two natures subsist after the union indivisibly?”<sup><a href="#fn147" id="fn147-ref">147</a></sup> Cyril shows both expressions to be incompatible and discordant, and wrote and as if in the manner of one disputing and refuting brings forth these words: CYRIL: “It is adverse again and no less the proposition to those who say that one is the incarnate nature of the Son, and wishing to show that inept, everywhere try to show two natures subsisting.”<sup><a href="#fn148" id="fn148-ref">148</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That also Nestorius, when he said two natures united, was convicted of confessing a union of affection, whose offspring is duality, just as the effect of true union is one according to composition and one nature and one hypostasis of the incarnate Word.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For Nestorius also, when he said “two natures,” and did not refuse to confess them “united,” can be seen through what he said, in the oration which is inscribed: “When it was read: ‘How often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?’<sup><a href="#fn149" id="fn149-ref">149</a></sup> and before him another bishop spoke about patience,” of which the beginning is: “Pleasant is that which the Doctor first narrated”: NESTORIUS: “But I, that is, the person of the Church, to whomever I speak, to all I teach: I call Christ perfect God and perfect man, not mixed in natures but united.”<sup><a href="#fn150" id="fn150-ref">150</a></sup> For in this is held the difference between our orthodox faith and his madness. We indeed, considering by contemplation alone those things from which Christ is, see two natures, which concurred into an inseparable union; but, after the thought of union, we judge it not right to say two natures, since they do not subsist in proper singular subsistences, but from both is absolved one hypostasis and one nature of the incarnate Word. But he, confessing a union of affection, according to which, he says, the Word of God by affection of love and friendship adapted to Himself the son from Mary separately first formed as an infant, and gave him the homonymy of sonship and power, and identity of will and equality of honor and authority, fittingly, even after such a union, confesses two natures united. For the effect of true and hypostatic union, by which the Word without change became flesh, that is, man, while remaining also God, is that one according to composition and one nature of God the Word incarnate is proclaimed; but the effect of the union of affection and fiction is that two natures are said, so that from their effects it may be understood what kind of union someone confesses, namely whether the true and hypostatic, or the pseudonymous. For indeed the name of union is proclaimed both by the adversary and by us, and likewise the conjunction of two natures is acknowledged to have been made. But through the things effected by union, as I said, the opposition of doctrines is understood. For he who confesses one incarnate nature of God the Word, signifies the confession of true union; but he who says two natures after the union, although bearing the name of union, thinks rather separation and by no means union.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And this again the wise Cyril teaches who, in the letter to Eulogius, thus wrote: CYRIL: “Not all things which heretics say are to be fled and rejected; for many things they profess from those which we also profess. For example, when Arians say that the Father is creator and lord of all, shall we therefore consequently turn away from such confessions? So also concerning Nestorius; although he says two natures, signifying the difference of flesh and God the Word—for one is the nature of the Word and another of flesh—nevertheless he does not yet confess union with us. For we uniting those, confess one Christ, one Son the same, one Lord, but besides one incarnate nature of the Son.”<sup><a href="#fn151" id="fn151-ref">151</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Attend therefore, O Grammarian subtle in your thoughts, how he who does not say “one incarnate nature of God the Word,” does not confess union with us. For it is not, as you say, that he who does not confess both formulas, both “one incarnate nature of God the Word” and “two natures united,” does not confess union with us: for that formula is the complement of true union, but this of the union of affection, which Nestorius confessed. For it is proper to those who confess hypostatic union, that what they see as if by thought alone, those from which Christ is, and apprehend by phantasy that two natures are incomprehensibly united, they by no means, after the thought of union, again say two those things which are not two in hypostases. For to say two even after the union and congeneration thence arising, dissolves the union, and permits neither one hypostasis, nor one Son, nor one Christ, one Savior and Lord of all, but induces duality in all things, separating each into two and effecting two hypostases, two sons, two lords, two christs. For about these in the first letter to Succensus he thus wrote: CYRIL: “And so as far as pertains to thought and to contemplating only with the eyes of the soul how the Only-begotten was inhumanated, we say that there are two natures which are united, but one Christ and Lord and Son, God the Word inhumanated and incarnate.”<sup><a href="#fn152" id="fn152-ref">152</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, if anyone perseveres to say those two things, which he sees only with the eyes of the soul, when they concur into union, two even after the thought of union, he has not so much according to the diligent instruction of the Doctor subtly seen with the eyes of the soul alone the union of two, but he has also separated those according to hypostasis, and by no means understood one Christ and Lord God the Word inhumanated and incarnate, as pertains to himself. For if it were permitted after the union to say two natures individual and united, it would be altogether superfluous for Cyril to indicate and say: “as far as pertains to thought and to contemplating only with the eyes of the soul.” But, because hypostatic union destroys section into two, therefore he conceded that those from which union was made be separated as if by contemplation alone.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And this again similarly in the letter to Acacius, bishop of Melitene, he says thus writing: CYRIL: “Therefore apprehending as if in thoughts those from which the one and only Son and Lord Jesus Christ is, we say indeed that there are two natures united; but, after the union, as if the section into two now removed, we believe there to be one nature of the Son, but inhumanated and incarnate.”<sup><a href="#fn153" id="fn153-ref">153</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Where therefore will you hide, O excellent one, the wise Cyril immediately saying that as if in thoughts only it is to be considered that there are two natures united; but, after the union, the section into two is removed, and it must be said that there is one nature of the incarnate and inhumanate Son?<sup><a href="#fn154" id="fn154-ref">154</a></sup> If indeed as if in thoughts only we say that there are two natures united, but after the thought of union, as if the section into two natures now removed, we confess one nature of the incarnate Son, it cannot be said “two natures individual and united” even after the union: for that section into two natures vanishes.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That those who say two natures after the union do not convert that which they separate in thought and contemplation; and that true and pseudonymous union are recognized from their effects.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">How therefore in this little book corrupted by the species of falsehood, while you boast in it that you explain the wise Cyril, you write these things: THE GRAMMARIAN: “To those he signifies that he who wishes through separation of thought to name the natures, does not differ from the orthodox faith. For he knew also Basil to have said: ‘But by thought we conceive the nature of each of them’<sup><a href="#fn155" id="fn155-ref">155</a></sup> and likewise Gregory of Nazianzus: ‘The argument, however, which we separate by thoughts of natures.’”<sup><a href="#fn156" id="fn156-ref">156</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Excellent is your diligence; more excellent your benevolence then in commemorating the holy Fathers concordantly! Therefore arise you also up to separation in thought to understand the difference of those which without confusion are gathered into one! Do not say two after the union! For thus also Saint Cyril, who separated in thought, who adhered to the prior Fathers and doctors, as you yourself have testified, says: CYRIL: “But separating by mere thoughts and apprehending the difference by subtle contemplations or phantasies of intellect, we do not place the natures separately, nor again do we allow perfectly the power of section upon them, but we understand them to be one, so that those two natures are now not two, but from both one animal is absolved.”<sup><a href="#fn157" id="fn157-ref">157</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This is the character of those who divide in thought, that those things which appear two in subtle contemplation or phantasies of intellect, they now do not say two after the thought of union. For you have heard Cyril say: “so that those two natures are now not two, but from both one animal is absolved.”<sup><a href="#fn158" id="fn158-ref">158</a></sup> If indeed you remain saying “two natures,” you place the natures separately and admit section absolutely, but not, as you lie, by contemplation alone, and you have made that one hypostasis, which you say through stimulation, two hypostases, so that God the Word is separately and man properly and separately, while they have individuality and union through identity of will, through equality of dignity according to authority; according to the unclean vaniloquies of Nestorius. And now you are caught in your own words: for from the trifles placed above from your wonderful book you added these: THE GRAMMARIAN: “Therefore Cyril anathematizes only those who place God singly and man singly, joined by identity of will, equality of honor according to authority: for these pertain to the madness of Nestorius.”<sup><a href="#fn159" id="fn159-ref">159</a></sup> How does he not turn his face away from that distinction in contemplation alone, following Basil and Gregory? How do you think that those who are seen to see two natures in hypostatic union are anathematized by you?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do you not see from the things considered before that you have pronounced one anathema upon your own head? For it has been shown that you do not separate natures in contemplation alone, nor approve that those two things which appear in thought only that the difference of those which are united be acknowledged, are now not said two after the union: which is the opinion of those who admit section perfectly, as the wise Doctor said, and place natures separately, which now by all necessity, according to the unclean fictions of words of Nestorius, through equality of honor are said individual and united.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But you say: “I confess hypostatic union.”<sup><a href="#fn160" id="fn160-ref">160</a></sup> Therefore show the effect of this union, so that you now do not say those two natures two, but from both one absolved, according to the word of the wise Cyril. But you do not consent. Therefore you have passed over these words in silence, while with pride you explained those words from the letter to Succensus, by which you said we are supported. But while you say two natures after the union, you indicate the offspring of Nestorian union and calumniate the mother—hypostatic union, which is generatrix not of two natures, but of one incarnate nature of God the Word—perfidiously as if from human conception a hippocentaur or bucephalus were born—which indeed are feigned in lying fables—or according to that which is written by the curse of the philosopher of virtue, nay of all virtue, for wheat he reaps thorns and for barley a bramble.<sup><a href="#fn161" id="fn161-ref">161</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Why therefore do you demonstrate hypostatic union, but introduce the offspring of mendacious and habitual union? I will tell the cause, O excellent one, and whoever occurs with subtle mind: namely because you are anxious to be considered orthodox in opinion, while you are Nestorian, and indeed ours in external species and face, but in depth and in hidden things you emulate them. For if you confess hypostatic union not fictitiously but truly, refuse to say two natures after the union, and confess one incarnate nature of God the Word. If indeed even after the union you say two natures individual and united, why do you call Nestorius himself mad, and by species reprove union through equality of honor and identity of will, while you foster his offspring, I say two natures after the union? For it is proper of true and individual union—and this is hypostatic union—that it perfects one incarnate nature of God the Word and one hypostasis. For thus also the word “individual” is significative of right faith; but that which says two natures, with “individual” and “united” added, imitates the appearance of rectitude, and adorns with the suasive word “individual” the person who is separated by duality. For one inseparably, one is nature after the union, and by no means two, even though composed without confusion from two certain things. But that which says two after the union, is separate according to hypostasis and pseudonymous union is added to it. For if the union is true, they are by no means two, but one Christ from two is understood. But where there are two, even though proclaimed individual, again the holy Cyril approaches and argues the deceit and those things which he wrote in the second letter to Succensus, he cries: CYRIL: “But that ‘inseparably’ added by them is considered indeed among us to be significative of right faith; but they do not so understand, but ‘inseparably’ among them is accepted in another way according to the vaniloquies of Nestorius. For they say that by equality of honor, identity of will and authority God the Word is inseparable from the man in whom He dwelt. Therefore they do not bring forth words simply, but with a certain duplicity and malice.”<sup><a href="#fn162" id="fn162-ref">162</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do not think with yourself, O wise one, that it is enough for you only to say: “I confess this hypostatic union; but that which is made by equality of honor and conceived as habitual, I hold unclean and turn my face from it,” that you may be inscribed among the orthodox, but from the effect acknowledge which union we name, whether this or that, keeping in mind that we have right opinion not in names but in things. For if you confess one incarnate nature of God the Word and separate by subtle intellect those from which union is, and see the natural conjunction without confusion made of two certain things among themselves not consubstantial, of the divinity of the Only-begotten Word and humanity, that you may accept the difference and not leap further, nor introduce perfect section, retaining and rejecting that by the thought of union, so that after the union “those two natures are now not two, but from both one is absolved”;<sup><a href="#fn163" id="fn163-ref">163</a></sup> you seem to hold in mind union according to hypostasis truly. But if you confess two natures after the union, seek for yourself some other union! For true union is not accepted by you, because it does not admit that He who from two is compacted into immutable and individual unity, again says two in you after the union. Therefore it is necessary that you acknowledge your own, that is, union of equality of honor and identity of will, and you hasten to that from which you fictitiously turn your face. For you do the same as vipers, about which those who know these things assert that they gnaw the wombs which conceived and carried them, being born; for you try by force to make the duality of natures the destroyer of that union which generated it, and in your mind you assail with reproaches that which bore for you so desired an offspring. For if you were truly orthodox, you would hold both offspring and its generatrix equally in hatred.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And so know clearly that we do not say anathema to those who in thought and as if in subtle contemplations and phantasies of intellect separate those from which Christ is and understand the difference of those, but to those who say two natures after the union, and with blasphemy fight against the mystagogue theologians, who cry and testify, suppressing the bilingualism of separators: “so that those two natures are now not two, but from both one animal is absolved,”<sup><a href="#fn164" id="fn164-ref">164</a></sup> the example taken from us showing the ineffable union of Emmanuel.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">If indeed occupied with those vaniloquies you again say: “I say both one incarnate nature and two natures individual and united,” again we will meet you with the same medicines and incantations, if only you hear the voice of incantation and be healed by the good and salutary medicine healed by the wise, as the prophet singing says.<sup><a href="#fn165" id="fn165-ref">165</a></sup> Who however is the wise? Cyril, the true physician of such diseases who, in the second letter to Succensus, introduces him who objecting asks: “How shall we not concede that two natures subsist after the union indivisibly?”<sup><a href="#fn166" id="fn166-ref">166</a></sup> and himself responds that this phrase is opposite and adverse to right opinion, and thus writes: CYRIL: “It is adverse again and no less the proposition to those who say that one is the incarnate nature of the Son, and wishing to show that inept, everywhere try to show two natures subsisting.”<sup><a href="#fn167" id="fn167-ref">167</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">How therefore, O good one, do you bring forth things which fight among themselves, as the same? How do you not perceive, while you say both our things and those which are placed against ours, and determine the same to be two and one, that you are caught by the words which Gregory the Theologian wrote to Cledonius about those who follow the impious doctrines of Apollinaris: GREGORY: “if only they knew to agree with themselves and not to say their own things and those of the adversary.”<sup><a href="#fn168" id="fn168-ref">168</a></sup> Such a thing is the assault of stupidity and truth, that they neither understand nor are ashamed of what is imputed to themselves.<sup><a href="#fn169" id="fn169-ref">169</a></sup> For it appears from these reprehensions that your Wisdom is subject to them, while you impose them on us, like impudent harlots who stand in a brothel, and spread and sell hidden ignominy, as holy Scripture says somewhere,<sup><a href="#fn170" id="fn170-ref">170</a></sup> and offer their own shame to the chaste. But it is not hidden from those who hear wisely and have experience of the bitterness and malice of heretics, to whom these things befit and why you induce such voices among themselves, that you may be a peacemaker for us, while you do not hear the Apostle saying: “What fellowship has light with darkness?”<sup><a href="#fn171" id="fn171-ref">171</a></sup> but emulate the bold deed of your fathers.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That it is proper to heretics, as if by a pact made and under the appearance of peace, to say: "Let us say phrases both ours and customary to the orthodox": which word the truth never approves. And it cannot be said, after the ineffable union, that there are both two natures individual and one incarnate nature.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For Nestorius also, the father of your error, with many artifices anxiously took care to impugn the phrase by which the Virgin is proclaimed God-bearer; and when he did not prevail, finally, offering peace of sinners<sup><a href="#fn172" id="fn172-ref">172</a></sup> and a pact not through the Spirit of God—the first indeed from David, the other from Isaiah<sup><a href="#fn173" id="fn173-ref">173</a></sup>—he said: “Let her be called God-bearer and man-bearer, and I assent.”<sup><a href="#fn174" id="fn174-ref">174</a></sup> For heretics anxiously care either to indicate their doctrine entirely or, unless they can introduce it entirely, cunningly mix certain heretical things skillfully and persuasively into the doctrine which is held.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Hear therefore how Nestorius recites that very thing which I said, in the oration which is titled: “On the divine inhumanation,” but was spoken when another before him spoke about charity,<sup><a href="#fn175" id="fn175-ref">175</a></sup> and of which the beginning is: “The preceding doctor placed for us the sweet table of charity.”<sup><a href="#fn176" id="fn176-ref">176</a></sup> NESTORIUS: “I say, and I add … .”<sup><a href="#fn177" id="fn177-ref">177</a></sup> For this the heretic does not approve, on account of the separation which is made from the confession of natures and phrases. Therefore I advise that we overcome also this contention of theirs about piety. Let us preach those twin phrases. For thus also the wise Paul used to heal for the disciples the things which gave causes of scandals and schism.<sup><a href="#fn178" id="fn178-ref">178</a></sup> AND AFTER A FEW THINGS: “Confess that which is said by all the orthodox. For this is proper to those who rightly call the Theotokos, and it is clear that not only Theotokos, but also Anthropotokos. For this is the perfect confession of right doctrine.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And these indeed are the words of Nestorius! Let them be considered, if it please, and also yours, and let them be shown to the hearers as the perfect likeness and clear image of the wickedness of the simulator of your fathers. THE GRAMMARIAN: "Therefore, blessed Cyril and those who said two natures concerning Emmanuel, he accepted, while fleeing the heresy of Apollinaris, and again he professed the assertion of the one incarnate nature of God the Word, on account of the section of Nestorius. For when both are proclaimed, it is indicative of right opinion; but when only one confession is put forth, a certain evil suspicion of heresy arises."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">O worst imitation! How much the opinions and words of the son imitate the opinions and words of the father! Nestorius said: "Let us preach those twin voices; for this is the perfect confession according to right doctrine: to proclaim the voice with the voice," and the Grammarian says: "For when both are proclaimed, it is indicative of right opinion." Again, Nestorius belched forth this poison: "I add voice to voice. For this the heretic does not approve," and the Grammarian sucked up and vomited the poison of his father: "But when only one of those voices is put forth, a certain evil suspicion of heresy arises."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">What therefore to these unstable pacts and by no means peaceful peaces and mixtures of opposing words hardly mixed, will the heretics contrive that which is inconceivable and impossible, to show them to be possible? The warrior of the Divine Spirit, Saint Cyril, who with Koheleth cried out: "There is a time of war and there is not a time of peace,"<sup><a href="#fn179" id="fn179-ref">179</a></sup> against Nestorius who, in the oration concerning the inhumanation, retaining the mixture, wrote thus: CYRIL: "For we say that the Word of God became man unchangeably. And as pertains to the nature of the flesh, the holy Virgin bore a body consubstantial with herself and with us: yet when we call her God-bearer, of this also the meaning certainly is inferred: for the holy Virgin did not bear bare divinity, but the Word of God united to flesh. Nor could 'God-bearer' be understood otherwise than in this way. And thus the confession of the inhumanation is prefigured, and so it is already true that the holy Virgin was made God-bearer, who wondrously bore one Christ, a partaker of our flesh and blood, consubstantial with us according to humanity, so that the flesh is from the God-bearer Mary. For she did not bear one similar according to substance, as it seemed to some heretics, but consubstantial, that is, from our substance. For Scripture says: 'He took hold of the seed of Abraham.'<sup><a href="#fn180" id="fn180-ref">180</a></sup> But truly 'similar according to substance' does not signify true man, but a likeness of the son of man, as Daniel says.<sup><a href="#fn181" id="fn181-ref">181</a></sup> The Apostle, however, taught not a likeness, but says: 'The man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all.'<sup><a href="#fn182" id="fn182-ref">182</a></sup> Consubstantial, moreover, with God and the Father according to divinity, just as we have confessed. Consubstantial with the Father, not similar according to substance. Superfluous therefore and without any necessity, when we say 'God-bearer', we also add 'man-bearer'. For sufficient, as I said, is the word 'God-bearer', which contains the confession of our entire mystery, and gives no cause for verbal fiction to those who wish to calumniate the truth. For it is the custom of heretics to transfer rightly said things to an adulterated sense: which indeed we by no means wonder at, considering that they err even in badly interpreting the divine Scriptures." Against the Grammarian, however, saying that it is necessary, after the union, to confess both two individual natures and the one incarnate nature of God the Word, he fought to Succensus, as we have often said, the second time writing thus: CYRIL: "It is adverse again and no less the proposition to those who say that one is the incarnate nature of the Son, and wishing to show that inept, they everywhere try to show two natures subsisting."<sup><a href="#fn183" id="fn183-ref">183</a></sup> And after a few things: "so that those two natures are now not two, but each, one animal is absolved."<sup><a href="#fn184" id="fn184-ref">184</a></sup> Again to Acacius, bishop of Melitene, he wrote: "But truly, after the union, as if the section into two now removed, we believe there to be one nature of the Son, but inhumanated and incarnate."<sup><a href="#fn185" id="fn185-ref">185</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For duality is section and separation of the one. So also, when in thought we consider those things from which that one is compacted into natural union, and see that there are two certain things which concurred with each other, we say we do not separate in conjunction and only insofar as we consider two. But if even after the thought of union we proceed to say two, we separate them even according to hypostasis, so that they are not one, but two hypostases and natures, to which we vainly smear union and inseparability as a certain artificial and feigned-name mask. Do not therefore bring forth duality, which destroys and separates this one Christ, as if it were the same as the names and opinions which, from the opposite side, disagree with it, into the midst, so that the by no means persuasive reconciler may proceed, as I said. For Saint Cyril rejects your pacts! For also Naas, when he had armed himself against some from Israel, threatened that he would make peace with them, thus saying: 'In this I will strike a covenant with you, that I may put out the right eye of all of you and impose a reproach upon Israel.'<sup><a href="#fn186" id="fn186-ref">186</a></sup> But they did not consent to these pacts, because they were Israel; but when they wept on account of the reproaches and insults of the barbarian, they besought the Lord and conquered. Therefore neither we, who are Israel insofar as we think rightly, seeing God face to face—for this is the appellation of Israel: 'intellect seeing God'—shall we receive your admonitory pacts; but from those whose right eye is put out, we would not differ at all, if we armed duality, warlike under the appearance of love, against the phrase 'one incarnate nature of God the Word', saying it is the same as the opposite phrase, as the investigation of those things which were previously searched into shows, from which it appears you have followed the heresy and the warfare of your fathers, as one who hastens to mix perverse things with right and sound things.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For Nestorius also received from Theodore, bishop of Mopsuestia, that which he added voice to voice; and he produced him writing these things: Saint Cyril, in the booklet against Theodore: THEODORE: "When therefore they ask: 'Whether Mary is?' we say both names: first indeed, according to the nature of the thing; but the other according to relation. For according to nature, because a man was in the womb of Mary, who also proceeded from there; but, because God was in the man born, not in him circumscribed according to nature, but existing in him according to the affection of the will." To these things, however, also after a few other things, he says wisely refuting those old women's and inept fables: CYRIL: "Therefore with better right than it is said by us the holy Virgin, even though she bore Christ according to the flesh. For when someone calls her that, he communicates to her the appellation which is said also of other mothers, who bore others according to the law fitting for humanity. But he who calls her 'God-bearer', immediately elevates the intellect of the hearers to the virtue of the mystery. For how a woman is 'God-bearer' anyone will investigate; but he will understand, because although the Word was God, it was made flesh, according to the word of John, and went forth as a man, having taken a dispensational generation from a woman. This we say is the union true and mystical and truly ineffable: for one is shown to us by nature and truth God and Son and Lord, Savior and Liberator of all."<sup><a href="#fn187" id="fn187-ref">187</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, just as the phrase 'God-bearer' is perfect and needs no heretical addition for one wishing also to call her 'man-bearer', so that with the names the one Christ himself is also divided into man separately and God singly; so also the formula by which we confess the one incarnate nature of God the Word is perfect and absolute, and by no means requires that two natures individual and united after the union be proclaimed, "as if the section into two now removed, so that those two natures are now not two, but each one is absolved."<sup><a href="#fn188" id="fn188-ref">188</a></sup> For I will cry out to you the very same words of Saint Cyril most often, if perhaps you hear, if perhaps you understand, O good one, as somewhere one of the prophets says to the ear slow to hear.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That each one of these formulas, by which we confess Christ both to be from two natures, and say there is one incarnate nature of God the Word, holds firm its perfect signification, for the sake of which it was also assumed. The overturning of this assertion: that it has the suspicion of heresies if we say Christ is "one incarnate nature of the Word", unless we simultaneously confess that He is also understood "in two individual natures".</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For if anyone wishes to consider, as can be done, those things from which Emmanuel is, he will see with the eyes of the intellect that the union was made from two natures, that is, from divinity and from humanity. But truly, after the thought of the union, he who is absolved from it will find there to be one hypostasis and one incarnate nature of God the Word, not two hypostases, not two natures, not two persons. For with duality admitted after the union, it follows fittingly that all things are "two". And so this confession: "Christ is from two natures", is indicative of the mode of the dispensation, as if considered in subtle phantasies of the mind, that is, to acknowledge and confess and adore the one incarnate nature of God the Word after the thought of perfect union; and it refuses the word of duality which shines forth. Which Cyril, the herald of the divine inhumanation with the apostles, manifestly established before us and offered to be seen with the very eyes and considered lucidly, in those things which he wrote thus in the first letter to Succensus: CYRIL: "Considering therefore, as I said, the mode of the inhumanation, we see two natures to have come together with each other in an indissoluble union without confusion and change: for flesh is flesh, and not divinity, although the flesh was made God's; and likewise the Word is God, and not flesh, although it made flesh dispensationally its own. Therefore, when we consider this, we say the concurrence into unity, which we say was made from two natures; but after the union we do not separate the natures from each other, nor do we cut that one and undivided into two sons, but we say one Son and, as the Fathers said, one incarnate nature of the Word."<sup><a href="#fn189" id="fn189-ref">189</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And so, since each confession attains its own purpose and is perfect for the demonstration and constitution of the thing about which it was assumed, and this formula "from two natures" elevates the intellect for a time, as can be said, to the inseparable ineffable conjunction of God the Word with humanity and to the concurrence of those things which were brought to union without confusion, and to the difference of them as if in subtle thoughts, and offers the mode of union, that is, of the conjunction of the inscrutable and inexplicable inhumanation, to be understood as can be done; but that formula "one incarnate nature of God the Word" perfectly and in a most wondrous way signifies the effect which appears after the thought of union, that is, the one hypostasis of the Son of God inhumanated, not dissolved into those things from which it was compacted, nor to be called "two natures" after the union, as you, O most audacious and impious, have dared to ascribe imperfection and thence arising stain to that perfect phrase, which indicates the wondrous and inseparable effect and such as is worthy of God, and to say that, unless with the confession of the one incarnate nature of God the Word also Emmanuel is proclaimed to be in two natures, that which we say—one incarnate nature of God the Word—does not escape the suspicion of fault and the reproach of heresy?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And how would these not be of a foolish and insane mind, nay truly of a heretical and daring to mix things which are not mixed? From where indeed does he smear that evil suspicion, as he said, to that so perfect phrase? Evidently from the treasury of the Nestorians, and—so that I may use your own word—from the caverns of darkness from which they thought they could build those weak propositions even against Saint Cyril, who expunged that very phrase. And see how worthy of laughter and full of all madness is their reprehension against that formula; it is held in the second letter to Succensus: "If there is one incarnate nature of God the Word, it is altogether necessary to say that confusion and mixture have been made, the human nature somehow diminished and stolen away in Him."<sup><a href="#fn190" id="fn190-ref">190</a></sup> And with the reprehension standing thus, did the wise Doctor, as you say, write: "And I say one incarnate nature of the Word, and I confess Emmanuel to be in two natures"? Did he use your impious and incredible little words, which say: THE GRAMMARIAN: "For when both are proclaimed, it is indicative of right opinion; but when only one confession is rejected, a certain evil suspicion of heresy arises"? By no means, but he testified that which is perfect and accurate, namely this inspired phrase; for he wrote thus: CYRIL: "Superfluously therefore do they speak who say, if there is one incarnate nature of the Word, that confusion and commixtion have altogether and entirely followed, as if the nature of man were diminished and subtracted. For it is neither diminished, nor, as they say, subtracted; for it suffices for the most full demonstration of this, that He was made man, to say: 'He was incarnate.' For if we were silent about this, their calumny would perhaps have some place; but when it is necessarily added, where is the mode of diminution or subtraction?"<sup><a href="#fn191" id="fn191-ref">191</a></sup> In the oration "That the one Christ", he proceeds with these words, testifying that the phrase itself is perfect, and by no means, according to the words of your stupidity, said that it needs, that Christ also be defined in two natures, when he spoke these things to the other person: CYRIL: "Most superfluous indeed, O friend, does he speak who says that confusion and mixture are made, if one incarnate and inhumanate nature of the Son is proclaimed by us. For no one could make the demonstration of this with necessary and true syllogisms. But if they set their own will as law for us, they have contrived a plan which they cannot establish. For attention must be paid not to them, but rather to the inspired Scripture."<sup><a href="#fn192" id="fn192-ref">192</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">From these things therefore observe how, as it is said in the gospel, the treasures of your heart proceed from your mouth, showing nothing else than that you are an adversary to Saint Cyril and all the supreme interpreters of orthodoxy, who handed down that there is one incarnate and inhumanate nature of the Word, when you smear no existing stain to that formula, unless simultaneously with it Christ is also proclaimed to be acknowledged in two natures. For you said: THE GRAMMARIAN: "But when only one confession is rejected, an evil suspicion of heresy arises."<sup><a href="#fn193" id="fn193-ref">193</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And so according to your arbitrary and impious laws, O good one, rebuke the apostolic man Athanasius, who said: ATHANASIUS: "We do not confess two natures to be of the one Son, one to be adored and one not to be adored, but one incarnate nature of God the Word and one to be adored with the flesh being adored."<sup><a href="#fn194" id="fn194-ref">194</a></sup> For, O chosen one, he rejected one of your confessions, I say "two natures", and confirmed the other, showing there to be one, and not two, to confess one incarnate nature of the Word; but he offered, against himself, a cause and an evil suspicion of heresy.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Repel this madness and reject those words, parricidal and hateful to God, which call the deiferous mystagogues heretics and worthy of anathemas; and the decrees of malediction against those who so behave, which pour forth derision upon the laudable and most renowned and perfect formula which confesses there to be one incarnate nature of God the Word. Tremble at the sacred Scripture, which brings malediction and derision upon you, saying: "An evil son is the malediction of his father,"<sup><a href="#fn195" id="fn195-ref">195</a></sup> and again: "The eye that mocks his father, the ravens from the valleys will pluck out and the sons of eagles will eat."<sup><a href="#fn196" id="fn196-ref">196</a></sup> Do not apply force to dissolve this insoluble and inseparable phrase with the duplicity of natures after the union, nor say: "With you I confess the true and hypostatic union, and from the union of love I turn away my face; I say there is one Christ and 'one incarnate nature of God the Word' and 'two individual natures'." For you are similar to him who both builds and destroys: you say indeed one nature to deceive and to be held as an intercessor, but you introduce two natures and with this pure mystery you studiously make a hollow.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Such were formerly those Samaritans who lived around Jerusalem, towards the Israelites who had returned from Babylon and were building the temple of God: who tried to mix themselves with them and pretended they wished to bring aid to the work, but in truth carefully took care to overthrow the building from the foundations. These also said: "We will build with you, for like you we seek your God and we sacrifice to Him,"<sup><a href="#fn197" id="fn197-ref">197</a></sup> but they heard from those whom they did not evade their machinations: "It is not for you and us to build a house to our God."<sup><a href="#fn198" id="fn198-ref">198</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And we say by no means interpretively to those who say two natures individual and united are the one Lord Jesus Christ: It is not for you and us to build, or to confess the hypostatic union. For when you say two natures, you are convicted of dissolving that very thing which you pretend to confess with your voice. For the effect of the hypostatic union is, as has been manifestly shown, that we say one incarnate nature of the Word, and by no means two natures.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But truly you also emulate the madness of the Samaritans in this, saying: "We confess both two natures and one incarnate nature of God the Word." For thus also it is written about them in the fourth book of Kings, which is the book of Kings: "They feared the Lord and served their own gods,"<sup><a href="#fn199" id="fn199-ref">199</a></sup> again: "And these nations were fearing the Lord and serving their carved images; for both their sons and the sons of their sons, as their fathers did, so they do until the present day."<sup><a href="#fn200" id="fn200-ref">200</a></sup> But those who thus went miserably to both parts, the prophet Elijah, inflamed with the fire of divine zeal, rebuked, thus saying: "How long will you limp on both hips? If the Lord is God, follow him; and if Baal is, follow him."<sup><a href="#fn201" id="fn201-ref">201</a></sup> These things also Saint Cyril appears to say to those who are according to the impiety of the Grammarian's fathers, writing harshly in defense of the ninth anathema against the reprehension of the impious Theodoret, who pretended to confess these well-sounding names, namely the mediating phrases "union" and "one Christ": CYRIL: "To you therefore union, and what utility thence, if two Christs and each singly and separately are conceived and preached? Therefore, although they put on a persona of piety and say to us 'one Christ', truly thinking two, let them hear from us: 'How long will you limp on both hips?' For it would be better to walk rightly, having a pure and firm faith, not limping with foolish opinions."<sup><a href="#fn202" id="fn202-ref">202</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, the things which are from the wise Doctor are these; they show the multiform and kindred machinations of those who divide the one Christ and do not disdain to go in both parts with words; and they stir up all things that they may mix in their own opinion, and indeed corrupt that which is right, as if under a borrowed persona through well-sounding words, but they hold impiety covered by force. I myself have, and indeed very fittingly, what shows that this excellent Grammarian approaches such evil machinations. For seeing his wall of two natures, which he built weakly from earthly and human reasonings, as if from unbaked bricks, shattered into hypostases and two persons and thus destroyed, he follows the turpitudinous Samaritan and hateful to God plans, and imagines himself to be building a tower with solid, as he thinks, materials upon Jerusalem, which is the immovable Church and faith founded upon the rock Christ. But the prophet Isaiah beforehand expanded with similar figures and subjected to malediction the subtlety of that one, thus saying: "And all the people of Ephraim and those who dwell in Samaria will know, who speak with contumely and with proud heart: 'Bricks have fallen, but come, let us hew stones; and let us cut down sycamores and cedars, and let us build for ourselves a tower.' And God will cast down those who rise up against Jerusalem and against Mount Zion against Him."<sup><a href="#fn203" id="fn203-ref">203</a></sup> For who will fight against the spiritual Jerusalem, which sees peace and is seen by peace, which is Christ: "For He Himself is our peace,"<sup><a href="#fn204" id="fn204-ref">204</a></sup> says Paul writing to the Ephesians. Moreover, 'Jerusalem' is interpreted 'vision of peace': therefore, it is madness to build an adversarial tower against her who is thus. But who also will overpass and scatter Mount Zion, a high watchtower—for thus it is interpreted in the Greek language—and prefiguring all things watching and beholding the sublimity of the word of piety, with a tower of machinations, without this tower utterly collapsing upon him who built it and being cast down upon the proud skull swelling with the tumor of arrogance and scattering his bones? Therefore indeed a certain wise man also says: "He who throws a stone high, throws it upon his own skull."<sup><a href="#fn205" id="fn205-ref">205</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For whoever is armed against the spiritual Jerusalem or against Mount Zion, is similar to him who throws a foundation stone into heaven and tries to throw it against God. Therefore the prophet says: "And God will cast down those who rise up against Jerusalem and against Mount Zion against Him,"<sup><a href="#fn206" id="fn206-ref">206</a></sup> just as if someone said: What do I say "those who rise up against Jerusalem and against Mount Zion"? For they rise up against God Himself of all, while they rise up against Jerusalem and against Mount Zion.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But now it is time to consider from what materials hateful to God that Grammarian also dares to build a tower and to hide impiety with obscure sentences and words.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>Confutation of the malice of the heretics thinking that they may hide impiety by a change of words and saying the formula "in two natures" is to be understood as "in two substances".</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This strenuous sophist says, and born in the very day or, to speak properly, in the very night, and who speaks words of darkness, that he says and confesses the one Christ in two united natures, understanding natures not as hypostases but as substances, so that Christ is acknowledged in two substances, that is, in generic significations, in collective divinity and in the common being of all humanity: for this reason, he says, Christ is also proclaimed consubstantial with the Father according to divinity and consubstantial with us according to humanity; for this cause also he placed a dissertation concerning substance and hypostasis and nature before his booklet, and said: THE GRAMMARIAN: "Substance indeed signifies that which is common, for example, the one divinity of the holy Trinity and the humanity common to us.<sup><a href="#fn207" id="fn207-ref">207</a></sup> Hypostasis, however, signifies one person of the Father or of the Son or of the Holy Spirit, or again of Peter or of John or of any man. Nature, however, is sometimes understood and said in place of substance, sometimes in place of hypostasis. Now, therefore, for this reason we also placed a full contemplation of these things before from the inspired instruction of the mystagogues of the Church, and prepared the hearer for the investigation of those things which were to be examined."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But let us hear the very words and names, if it please, that we may learn how in two natures, that is, substances, this strenuous one confesses Christ, and in a truly youthful manner inflates his cheeks and glories that he says the words of the holy Fathers: THE GRAMMARIAN: "Therefore where the Fathers put 'nature' in the singular, without adding 'of God the Word', then they signify substance, and say there are two natures in Christ: for they know Him to be consubstantial with the Father and with us according to one and the other."<sup><a href="#fn208" id="fn208-ref">208</a></sup> AND AGAIN: "Therefore, when he said 'one nature of God the Word', he offers that one of the Trinity to be understood, who is the hypostatic person of the Word, who is consubstantial with the Father, as possessing the same substance of His begetter. But when he added 'incarnate of flesh endowed with soul and mind', he teaches that to God the Word belongs that which is common, of the whole substance of men, not placing a marked man and a distinct person, but that which appears commonly in any man, which is substance. For every man is flesh animated by rational and intelligent soul. Therefore, in one person of the holy Trinity, which is God the Word, he places the salvation of all men through union. Consequently, in two natures, that is, substances, God the Word inhumanated is acknowledged: for in Him is held the substance of divinity, and in Him is also held the substance of humanity."<sup><a href="#fn209" id="fn209-ref">209</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What Jeremiah, knowing to labor mystically over such great madness and such stupor, would not weep and not emit a lamentation over these senseless ones? As if it were not sufficient for the rational nature alone, as is worthy, to lament, he also says: "O walls of Zion, pour down tears like torrents day and night."<sup><a href="#fn210" id="fn210-ref">210</a></sup> But if anyone wishes to understand high and sublime, the walls of the Church, the spiritual Zion, are the souls of men who have conducted themselves well and have preached the word of piety, whom Paul calls columns;<sup><a href="#fn211" id="fn211-ref">211</a></sup> or again, they are the incorporeal virtues, whose work it is to guard those who have covenanted with God, as is sung by the prophet David: "The Angel of the Lord will encamp around those who fear Him."<sup><a href="#fn212" id="fn212-ref">212</a></sup> And he will call the walls of the Church, that is, of Zion, to communion of mourning. For just as we learn from the voice of the gospel, joy is made by the heavenly virtues over one sinner doing penance;<sup><a href="#fn213" id="fn213-ref">213</a></sup> so without controversy they also suffer and participate in pain with those who fear God, concerning every sin indeed, but especially concerning blasphemy against God. Let Micah also cry out opportunely words similar to the words of Jeremiah, and as if to the confusion of the mad and impious and fallen into stupor, let him call the valleys and hills into judgment of impiety against God as if they could perceive more than these: "Hear, O hills, the judgment of the Lord, and you valleys and foundations of the earth, because the judgment of the Lord is with His people."<sup><a href="#fn214" id="fn214-ref">214</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">With what ears indeed would someone receive this blasphemy, which exceeds measure? Surely because the Word is consubstantial with the Father, as possessing the very same substance of His begetter, but consubstantial also with us, as incarnate of flesh endowed with soul and mind, in two natures, that is, substances, God the Word inhumanated is conceived: for He has the substance of divinity, and He also has the substance of humanity! For proceeding he adds these things—for it is necessary that all his words be indicated and gathered, with the obscurities of his dispersed impiety collected into one: THE GRAMMARIAN: "Adhering indeed to the words of the holy Fathers, because we have said from them that Christ is consubstantial with the Father and God and consubstantial with us, we say Him to be in two natures, that is, substances."<sup><a href="#fn215" id="fn215-ref">215</a></sup> AND AGAIN: "Thus therefore in Christ a union of two substances has been made."<sup><a href="#fn216" id="fn216-ref">216</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Consider, therefore, the word to flee outside the sacred Scriptures and to fall into vanity. For if you introduce to us a union of substances, O excellent one, but you have said that the substances themselves are understood by you as "that which appears commonly in all"—for I will use your words—but that which appears commonly in all, which indeed of the holy Trinity is divinity—for one and the same divinity is in three hypostases—and of us is rationally animated flesh—for one and the same is in the whole genus of men; if moreover the mystagogues of the Church say the union of inhumanation is the conjunction of flesh, evidently rationally animated, to God the Word, following the inspired voice of the gospel manifestly crying: "The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us,"<sup><a href="#fn217" id="fn217-ref">217</a></sup>—which union they also call incarnation and inhumanation and composition, insofar as God the Word, one hypostasis, hypostatically united to Himself one particular and individuated rationally and wisely animated flesh, born from the God-bearer Mary—while the Father and the Holy Spirit are not composite with flesh, and are not inhumanated—and finally, if there is incarnation and inhumanation and composition of anyone, evidently there is also union of that one: therefore not a union of substances has been made, but of the one hypostasis of God the Word to particular flesh, endowed with soul and mind, born from the Virgin God-bearer. And hear Athanasius, the star of the dogmas of orthodoxy, who makes the pure light of doctrine shine for us concerning the proposed matter;—which words you also placed in that lamentable booklet, though you by no means understood them: for if you had understood, you would not have collapsed into such error; and they are these: ATHANASIUS: "And from that 'how?' and 'in what manner?' and 'by what consequence' they also fell into infidelity; and they established indwelling in place of incarnation, and in place of union or composition human efficacy, and in place of the one hypostasis of our Lord Jesus Christ two hypostases and persons, and in place of the holy Trinity a quaternity: they think unbecomingly and unjustly."<sup><a href="#fn218" id="fn218-ref">218</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Is it not evident to all that composition is hypostatic, the union of God the Word to particular flesh, and by no means a union of those substances which are acknowledged according to generic signification and according to commonality? For not because according to substance the Father and the Holy Spirit are united to the incarnate Word, will the Father and the Holy Spirit be deemed to be composite with the flesh born from Mary. Nor again, because that body endowed with soul and mind, which is united to the Word, is homogeneous and consubstantial with the body of all men, shall we think that the whole humanity is implicated with the Word and composite with Him. For this union, which is had through inhumanation, is called incarnation and composition. Therefore we understand union and incarnation from what things they are. It is evident from the one hypostasis of God the Word and from particular humanity perfectly having itself, that is, from flesh animated by rational and intelligent soul; and from these very natures among themselves by no means homogeneous and consubstantial, which concurred and are composite ineffably, we say one Christ and one hypostasis and one incarnate nature of God the Word.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Which also the excellent doctor Cyril manifestly confirms in the prosphonetic oration to the most pious emperor Theodosius writing thus: CYRIL: "The mediator of God and men, as it is written, we say to be composite from humanity like us perfectly having itself according to its proper reason and from the Son, who appeared from the Father according to nature, that is, from the Only-begotten. We affirm, however, that there is indeed a certain coming together and likewise a concurrence, surpassing word, into union, of natures disparate and dissimilar among themselves; but nevertheless we acknowledge one Christ and Lord and Son, who is and is conceived one and the same God simultaneously and man."<sup><a href="#fn219" id="fn219-ref">219</a></sup> Similarly in the fourth book on adoration in spirit he said: CYRIL: "Composite also is incense; for composed of two is the reasoning about Christ, since He is simultaneously God and man, nevertheless one Son from both—and Christ, to whom it is said, and indeed by us ourselves: 'Your name is ointment poured out.'"<sup><a href="#fn220" id="fn220-ref">220</a></sup> Again, in the ninth book: CYRIL: "For although the Word was God, it was made flesh. And composite with us is Emmanuel, the divine nature and humanity gathered ineffably through union surpassing every word."<sup><a href="#fn221" id="fn221-ref">221</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But if you say, O good one, that you assert the one Christ to be "two united and individual natures", that is, two substances according to generic signification and, as you said, according to that which appears commonly in all men—for always reduce your words to memory, lest you escape reprehension—and if you understand one nature commonly the whole divinity which appears in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, for this is commonality—again but you think one nature to be the whole humanity generically taken; and finally if incarnation and composition is, the union of inhumanation—how will you flee this conclusion and impiety exceeding every sense, namely the conclusion to be gathered from these words and unbecoming thoughts, that the holy Trinity is incarnate with the whole humanity? For you say—and you are not ashamed, distorting this very thing up and down, or rather yourself distorted by foolish thoughts—: "In two united and individual substances I acknowledge and seek the one Christ,"<sup><a href="#fn222" id="fn222-ref">222</a></sup> since you acknowledge natures indeed as substances according to commonality which is understood in all. You added also these things, rebuking those who contradict you and defraud you, as you said, of your good and accurate confessions: THE GRAMMARIAN: "For when we say 'two natures hypostatically united', they are willingly deaf; erasing from our confession this phrase 'hypostatically united', they use against us an insistence which recedes far from our confession."<sup><a href="#fn223" id="fn223-ref">223</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And who is it who strips or despoils you of such things, from which you are subject to much ridicule? We would pray, however, for you that you not be thus inebriated and become proud, nor think beyond what is to be thought, as somewhere Paul also writing to some says: "We pray to God that you do no evil."<sup><a href="#fn224" id="fn224-ref">224</a></sup> But because you are so incurable, who with machinations to corrupt the simple hide the snares of perdition, it is fitting that we cut something from your words, that we may also gather them with you. For you raise up the duality of natures, which cuts the one Christ into two, to substances understood according to common signification, and say those to be united according to hypostasis, or, that I may use this your word also, hypostatically. Therefore, explain to us how these substances—I say that which is common of divinity and that which is common of humanity—are united hypostatically and are composite with each other and absolve one hypostasis: for thus you said above, defining: THE GRAMMARIAN: "Therefore where the Fathers put 'nature' in the singular, without adding 'of God the Word', then they understand substance."<sup><a href="#fn225" id="fn225-ref">225</a></sup> Again in the preceding, and immediately according to the introductory words of the wonderful booklet, he said similar things: THE GRAMMARIAN: "Thus therefore when Saint Cyril says 'nature' in the singular, without adding 'of God the Word', he signifies the common substance of divinity."<sup><a href="#fn226" id="fn226-ref">226</a></sup> Therefore, following your clever definitions, we understand your words, and by no means are we willingly deaf. But when you say absolutely, without any addition, that those two natures of yours are united hypostatically, that which is common of substances, as you ordered, we understand. Again then we ask prudence: how is that which is common of divinity, which is acknowledged in the Trinity, composite with that which is common or the substance of humanity? For composition is the union which is had in inhumanation, which is also called incarnation. For you wrote: THE GRAMMARIAN: "When we say 'two natures hypostatically united', they are willingly deaf, erasing from our confession this phrase 'hypostatically united'."<sup><a href="#fn227" id="fn227-ref">227</a></sup> Behold, with open ears we have heard your words and have received that natures, when proclaimed indefinitely, signify substances and that which is commonly signified, which is of divinity indeed the holy Trinity, but of humanity the whole genus of men. Entangled also in your own snares you are caught in those things which we wrote in the letter to Mena with these words: SEVERUS: "For they will not proceed to such madness as to say that they use the appellation of natures for generic signification—I say the signification of substance. For if, as is thence acknowledged, one nature is the holy Trinity, but one nature is of the whole humanity, the holy Trinity will be found—to say something which will be greatly ridiculed—inhumanated to the whole humanity, that is, to the human genus. But otherwise the sacred Scriptures teach us: God the Word, one only of the three hypostases, they teach incarnate and inhumanated, for 'the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us'."<sup><a href="#fn228" id="fn228-ref">228</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">When you read these things, O good one, how did you not avoid ridicule, how did you not shudder at impiety, but you say there to be a hypostatic union of two substances, according to common and generic signification? And so far are you from turning away from your evil and insane opinion, that you also set it forth as if by way of objection, and try to solve it with the most false syllogisms which you wrongly constructed, and again not undeservedly rely on those things which were solved.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore let the objection be set forth, and likewise the strenuous solution of your subtle erudition: THE GRAMMARIAN: "But if you say that there are two substances in Christ, it is necessary to say also that the Father and the Spirit and, to speak summarily, the holy Trinity itself is incarnate with the whole humanity, that is, with the human genus. These are the objections of the adversaries. For they think the substance of divinity to be subject to division and its part indeed to appear in the Father, but part in the Son, but part in the Holy Spirit, so that each of the hypostases is conceived in part, but not in all those things which are proper of divinity. But we do not come to such impiety: that we think there to be division or section in the divine substance; but we say that to every marked hypostasis without diminution inhere all the marks of divinity, namely goodness, efficiency and all things which are of uncreated nature. For thus also we say the Trinity to be consubstantial, insofar as the same substance is acknowledged perfectly in three persons. For also the Father has the perfect substance of divinity, likewise also the Son and the Holy Spirit; whence, perfect God is the Father, perfect God the Son, perfect God the Holy Spirit. Of whom Paul is the defender, the herald of truth, teaching: 'For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.'<sup><a href="#fn229" id="fn229-ref">229</a></sup> For he does not say the Father to be incarnate, but that the whole divinity in three hypostases without diminution is in the Father, in the Son, in the Holy Spirit, since in each hypostasis it is perfectly, according to the word of our Savior, who says: 'All things that the Father has are mine,'<sup><a href="#fn230" id="fn230-ref">230</a></sup> that is, all the marks which are of the substance of the Father, they are of God the Word, even when He is incarnate; not as if the Father is the Son or the Son is the Father, for those names are significative of mutual relation. How therefore shall we not say the substance of divinity to be without diminution in Christ, when we say Him to be perfect God? How truly, when we confess Him perfect man, shall we not confess the whole substance of humanity to be in Him? For not, as Apollinaris says, did He assume a part from that humanity, that is, flesh without rational soul, but He assumed the whole substance, which is flesh animated by rational and intelligent soul: for this, since it is found perfectly in each one of men commonly, is rightly called substance, for among themselves individual men are separated constituted apart not by substance, but by the properties themselves fitting to them, magnitude and color and, to speak universally, by the properties of the characters of persons."<sup><a href="#fn231" id="fn231-ref">231</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">To these things therefore we say this: The holy Trinity is neither subjected to the limits of nature, nor included by the priority of our mind, because it is unknown what it is according to substance, and is above all things and above every sense and not even apprehended by the movements of our thought, but transcends and overflows every intellectual phantasy with incomprehensibility. For Gregory, who bears the name of theology itself, says in the second oration on theology: GREGORY: "For one species of circumscription is also comprehension."<sup><a href="#fn232" id="fn232-ref">232</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Wherefore they exalt the Trinity both above substance and above nature; thoughts most clever, most subtle and most considered and most profound. For this same theologian says, in the oration indeed on the union of monks, "the best indeed of all things that are and most subtle is God, unless perhaps many exalt Him above essence, but not place all in Him, from whom also others are,"<sup><a href="#fn233" id="fn233-ref">233</a></sup> but in that oration which is inscribed: "To those who had arrived from Egypt", he wrote: "I know two principal differentiae in things that are. Domination indeed and servitude: not those which among us either tyranny has cut or poverty has disjoined, but which nature has distinguished, if it please anyone to say nature: for that which is first, is also above nature."<sup><a href="#fn234" id="fn234-ref">234</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And so the Trinity, prior and very sublime above all, is also above substance and above nature, and by no means subjected to these names. But because, as the Doctor said in the said oration on theology, "our mind labors, that it may go forth from corporeal things and adhere to more incorporeal things, as long as with its infirmity it speculates those things which surpass its force,"<sup><a href="#fn235" id="fn235-ref">235</a></sup> compelled by necessity, from the opinions and names of poverty, which is found among us, we dare to approach the divine significations that we may thence receive obscure sparks of minimal comprehension.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Whence, also concerning the holy Trinity, incomprehensible and accessible to none, we have used the names "nature" and "substance" and "hypostasis", and all names similar and near to these; and we have accepted the name "substance", which is indicative of generic signification concerning the holy Trinity, and we have said one substance to be the three hypostases of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, that is, one divinity. For God is the Father, God also the Son, God also the Holy Spirit, as someone would say Peter and Paul and John to be one humanity. For men are equally according to genus and according to substance; but they are separated by the singular characters of hypostases. Therefore each of the hypostases, which are under genus and substance, and under common signification being through the common reason of substance, and through the properties standing by him, he exists as this or that. So also that reason of substance indeed is common, for example, goodness, divinity, or whatever else is conceived; but the hypostasis is perceived in the property of unbegottenness or sonship or sanctifying virtue."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Just as therefore among us humanity as a whole substance comprehends many hypostases, namely of Peter and Paul and John and all others; but Peter and Paul and John are hypostases equally participating in that very substance—for each of them perfectly and without diminution partakes of humanity and is man, and is distinguished by a proper character and joined to consubstantial hypostases by absolute similitude and absence of diversity of genus and of that which is common, but he himself is not the whole substance and humanity, which comprehends each one of the hypostases: so also what pertains to the holy Trinity, the substance indeed is the whole divinity comprehensive of the three hypostases of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, but each one of the hypostases also partakes of the substance through equality of dignity and is perfectly God, and has no difference with consubstantial hypostases, and is separated and divided from others by proper notion, unbegottenness and generation and procession, preserving by property immunity from confusion.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore the Son, who is united to flesh endowed with reason and soul and is inhumanated, is one hypostasis from those hypostases which are found in the very substance of divinity, but is not the whole substance and divinity comprehensive of three hypostases and significative of that which is common. Why therefore do you think, O wise one, that the unlearned hearing is to be seduced and deceived by you with a change and subreption of words, writing: THE GRAMMARIAN: "How therefore shall we not say the substance of divinity is without defect in Christ, where we say Him to be perfect God? How truly, when we also confess Him perfect man, shall we not confess the whole substance of humanity to be in Him? For He did not assume a part of that humanity, as Apollinaris said, namely flesh without intelligent soul." Moreover, recall the words of the wise Basil, which you also adduced, not understanding them but having intellect buried under ignorance and impiety; words, I say, which are found thus in the epistle to Terentius: BASIL: "For each one of us also participates in being through the common reason of substance and through the properties standing by him he exists as this or that."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore each one of the hypostases perfectly partakes of that which is common, of substance, but it itself is not the whole substance and generic signification, which comprehends all hypostases of all. For example, Peter partakes of that which is common, of humanity, and is indeed a perfect man, but is by no means that very thing which is common, and the substance itself and the whole humanity. So also God the Word partakes of that which is common, of substance, and is perfect God, but He is not that which is common and the whole substance and divinity, which comprehends three hypostases; and when He was immutably made man, and hypostatically united to Himself one flesh rationally animated, He perfectly partook of that which is common, of humanity and our substance, but He did not hypostatically unite to Himself humanity and that which is common and the generic signification, which comprehends all hypostases and all men, nor was He composite with it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Hence it is manifest that Christ, since He is the same perfect God and perfect man, is one hypostasis from those which are comprehended in the substance of divinity, but not the whole divinity and substance, which comprehends three hypostases; and since He is one incarnate hypostasis, He did not hypostatically unite to Himself the whole substance of humanity, which comprehends all hypostases of all, but one flesh endowed with soul and mind, which underlies the substance and generic name of humanity. Therefore not the whole substance of divinity, which generically and commonly comprehends three hypostases, nor again the whole substance of humanity, which in common notification comprehends all men, are united among themselves and have absolved one hypostasis of Christ.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Break therefore the pen of impiety, which indeed dares to act deceitfully, but falls into extreme stupidity, and writes: THE GRAMMARIAN: "How truly, when we confess Christ also perfect man, shall we not confess the whole substance of humanity to be in Him?" For God the Word did not hypostatically unite to Himself the whole humanity and substance and that which is common and the genus, but He assumed one flesh, which underlies the substance and genus of the whole humanity, that is, flesh animated by intelligent soul, fully and perfectly partook of humanity, and became consubstantial with us according to flesh, just as it is written that He similarly partook of the same things with us, and was made like us in all things except sin, who according to divinity is consubstantial with the Father and the Spirit. Why therefore do these terrors rush upon you, with which you thought to terrify the simple like children, when you said: THE GRAMMARIAN: "For He did not assume a part from that humanity, as Apollinaris said, namely flesh without rational soul, but assumed the whole substance, which is flesh animated by intelligent and rational soul: for this, since it is found perfectly in all men commonly, is rightly called substance."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, know, O wise one—for the same thing very often infused into you, inebriated with impiety and wishing also to make participants of your vertiginous madness the unlearned—that each one of us is a partaker of that which is common, of substance perfectly and not in part, as the wise Basil taught in divine matters, when he wrote to Terentius, namely of rationality, mortality, the faculty of receiving mind and knowledge, but is not himself the whole substance and generic signification, which comprehends all hypostases rational, mortal, apt for receiving mind and knowledge: for this is any man; therefore also God the Word Himself perfectly partook of that which is common, of substance, when He was united to one flesh having rational soul, but was not incarnate to the whole substance and all flesh rationally animated, for this your words lead to, while you say: THE GRAMMARIAN: "but assumed the whole substance, which is flesh animated by intelligent and rational soul." For it is one thing to say that every hypostasis underlying genus and substance perfectly partakes of that which is common, perceived in substance, and another to call flesh the whole substance. For the whole substance is a certain generic signification comprehensive of many hypostases, but the hypostasis perfectly partakes of substance, just as also each one of homogeneous hypostases; but not each hypostasis, because it perfectly partakes of substance, is called the whole substance, which includes all hypostases in the manner of a genus. For will the soul of Paul, partaking of the substance of rationality and the faculty of receiving mind and knowledge, be deemed to be the whole substance of rational souls, because they also similarly partake of that which is common, of substance, and therefore we shall think all souls united by concretion to the flesh of Paul? Or, in turn, because the flesh of Paul has homogeneity or consubstantiality with other human fleshes and perfectly partakes of that which is common, of substance, therefore shall we think it to be the whole substance of fleshes themselves, and deem every flesh of man to be in composition with the soul of Paul? It is manifest dementia and insanity to think thus. For if each one of the hypostases, because it partakes of that which is common, of substance, is deemed to be the whole substance, the discourse concerning substance and hypostasis is confounded and corrupted by us, and there is nothing which distinguishes both discourse and difference, and then that word is not significative of commonality, but this of property.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore in the same way also God the Word, since He is one hypostasis and has that which is common, of substance, that is of divinity, perfectly concreted in Himself, and therefore is perfectly God, is not the whole divinity and substance comprehensive of three hypostases; nor again because in the Father and the Holy Spirit that which is common, of substance, is concreted, and also the Father is perfectly God, and likewise the Spirit is perfectly God and are conjoined by reason of consubstantiality, therefore shall we say the whole substance of divinity is united to that flesh from Mary having rational soul; nor again, vice versa, because the flesh endowed with soul and mind of the incarnate God the Word fully and perfectly partakes of that which is common, of substance and the generic element of all humanity, shall we think it to be the whole substance and genus of men, so that, according to your unlearned garrulity, the whole substance of humanity is deemed to be in the Word, and the Word Himself is deemed to be incarnate generically to the whole humanity.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>Investigation of confutation, indicating that this assertion, "Christ is in two substances according to the common signification of substance," is to be deemed most stupid blasphemy, namely that the holy Trinity is deemed incarnate to the whole human genus.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This truly is what was said by the wise Paul: "Adulterating the word of truth,"<sup><a href="#fn236" id="fn236-ref">236</a></sup> and again: "Adulterating the word of God in the wickedness of men, in the cunning of the circumvention of error,"<sup><a href="#fn237" id="fn237-ref">237</a></sup> so that, as it is written, infants may be tossed and carried about by every wind of doctrine.<sup><a href="#fn238" id="fn238-ref">238</a></sup> For this excellent one, by saying that he confesses the hypostatic union of substances, and by saying Christ is "in two natures," confessed Him to be "in two substances." And sometimes indeed he wrote: THE GRAMMARIAN: "Thus therefore when Saint Cyril elicits 'nature' in the singular, without adding 'of God the Word,' he signifies the common substance of divinity."<sup><a href="#fn239" id="fn239-ref">239</a></sup> Sometimes, however, he again adds: "If therefore two substances remain immutably and unconfusedly, where by true and hypostatic union they absolve one person and one hypostasis of Christ, how shall we not say two substances in Christ?"<sup><a href="#fn240" id="fn240-ref">240</a></sup> and he adjoined many things similar to these. Afterwards, however, when he saw his word falling into this, that those substances signify that which is common and comprehend many hypostases, so that it arrives at the necessity of saying the holy Trinity is incarnate to the whole humanity, trying to flee the stupid error into which he precipitated himself, he says: "I do not say the Father or the Holy Spirit is incarnate, but I say the substance of divinity is without defect in Christ, where I say Him to be perfect God; and when I confess Him perfect man, I say the whole substance of humanity is in Him; and thus again I say the union of two substances is held in Christ."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But he is caught who through circuit and most flexuous deceit reverts to the same blasphemy, as the oration now considered shows, since it expands his many machinations. For Christ is not the substance of divinity, but one hypostasis of the substance of divinity perceived and understood in the Trinity—which hypostasis is the Son, the Word immutably incarnate to one flesh endowed with soul and mind, which He assumed from the God-bearing Virgin through hypostatic union, in which He shows the Father [as an image shows] the exemplar and as a word shows the hypostatic intellect, which begot Him, with accuracy, but not as if the hypostasis of the Father were poured out in Him: for this is of the impious mixture of Sabellius and Marcellus. So also the Holy Spirit shows the Son in Himself, since He adheres in a certain way to the Word and proceeds from the Father, and therefore is called both Spirit of God, namely of the Father, and Spirit of Christ. For Paul wrote, to the Corinthians indeed: "But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God,"<sup><a href="#fn241" id="fn241-ref">241</a></sup> to the Romans again: "If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His."<sup><a href="#fn242" id="fn242-ref">242</a></sup> And Gregory, homonymous of the miracles done in Christ, in faith through John the Evangelist and the God-bearing Mary revealed to him, said thus: "One Holy Spirit, having existence from the Father and manifested through the Son, namely to men, perfect image of the perfect Son."<sup><a href="#fn243" id="fn243-ref">243</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">This, however, is not a demission of the Spirit of divinity, but the accurate order of theology, without which it cannot be that we have knowledge of divinity, and that as much as we attain. For it is absolutely necessary that we be led to attainment by the light of the Holy Spirit; for the God-bearing Basil wrote, in the epistle on the Holy Spirit to Amphilochius, in the twenty-sixth chapter, in this way: BASIL: "And the adoration in the Spirit indicates the operation of our mind as if not made, as you can learn from the words to the Samaritan woman. For when, deceived by the custom of the region, she thought adoration to be in place, our Lord, teaching her, said it is necessary to adore in Spirit and truth, calling Himself truth. Therefore just as we say adoration in the Son, as in the image of God and the Father, so also in the Spirit as showing in Himself the divinity of the Lord. Therefore also in the adoration of the Spirit we are by no means separated from the Father and the Son. For if you are outside Him, you are in no way adoring; but if you are in Him, you in no way separate Him from God, no more than you remove light from the visible: for it is impossible to see the image of the invisible God, except in the light of the Spirit, and he who beholds the image cannot remove the light from the image. For that which is the cause of seeing, necessarily appears with those who see. Therefore properly and congruently through the illumination of the Spirit we see the splendor of the glory of God, but through the character we are led up to Him whose it is and the seal of the same form."<sup><a href="#fn244" id="fn244-ref">244</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">From these things, therefore, we learn that there is not confusion of hypostases in the holy Trinity, but that each one of the hypostases in the substance of divinity, with its proper signification, has through that same thing which is common, of substance, no difference with consubstantial hypostases and similitude in all and is one and the same; but through property it has immunity from confusion, so that on account of that equality in all of that which is common, the others also are seen and acknowledged in each one of the hypostases, which partake of the same substance. For led to this, also that saying of the Lord Himself: "He who has seen me has seen the Father,"<sup><a href="#fn245" id="fn245-ref">245</a></sup> as Saint John, bishop of Constantinople, explaining this very sentence in the exposition of the gospel of John, wrote thus: JOHN: "Because being the same as the Father, while remaining the Son, He rightly shows His begetter in Himself. Afterwards, however, separating the hypostases, He said: 'He who has seen me has seen the Father,' lest anyone should say He Himself is the Father and He Himself the Son. For if He were the Father, He would not say: 'He who has seen me has seen Him.'" And again a few things: "For Philip sought knowledge from sight, and because he thought he had seen Him Himself, but wished also to see the Father thus, He showed that he had not even seen Him. But if anyone says here vision is knowledge, we will not dispute against this: for he who knows me, He says, knows also the Father. But He does not say this, but when he wished…"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This Gregory the Theologian said in the oration on the Holy Spirit: GREGORY: "as in three suns cohering among themselves one commixture of light."<sup><a href="#fn246" id="fn246-ref">246</a></sup> But Saint Basil, in the epistle to the canonical, as we adduced above, wrote: BASIL: "Since therefore the Father is light without beginning, but the Son is begotten light, and both are light and light, consubstantiality will be said between them, to indicate equality of dignity of nature."<sup><a href="#fn247" id="fn247-ref">247</a></sup> But when he sent the epistle to Amphilochius, he said these things concerning the impious Sabellius: "Who also himself in many places, confounding the notion, tries to separate the persons, and says the same hypostasis is always transformed according to occurring use."<sup><a href="#fn248" id="fn248-ref">248</a></sup> The wise John, bishop of Constantinople, when he explained the venerable gospel of his homonym, in the seventy-fourth oration, explaining the sentence: "Believe in me, that I am in the Father and the Father in me,"<sup><a href="#fn249" id="fn249-ref">249</a></sup> wrote these things: JOHN: "It was indeed necessary for you, hearing the Father and the Son, to seek nothing else for the showing of kinship according to substance. But if this is not sufficient for you to show equality of honor and consubstantiality, at least learn from the works."<sup><a href="#fn250" id="fn250-ref">250</a></sup> And again, in the following oration: "I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Paraclete, that is, another such as I am. Let those also blush who labor with the disease of Sabellius and those who do not have the same congruent opinion concerning the Spirit. For the very miracle of the word is this, that it strikes down heresies diametrically opposed with one blow. For by saying 'another' it shows difference of hypostasis, but by saying 'Paraclete' it shows kinship of substance."<sup><a href="#fn251" id="fn251-ref">251</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph"><em>Demonstration absolving those things which were considered and shown in the previous chapter, namely which shows that the same blasphemy is prepared by this assertion that "in Christ is held the whole substance of divinity and the whole substance of humanity," and that he does not at all divide the substance of divinity who does not think so turpitudinously.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">If therefore the begotten light, the Son, is, showing in Himself as in an image the unbegotten light, the Father, nor is the hypostasis of the begetter confounded with Him, and, another is the Paraclete besides the Holy Spirit, and is separated from Him and differs according to hypostasis, but on account of absence of difference of common substance in Him as image both is seen and understood the Son, who is incarnate and inhumanated, what division, do you think, does this make of the holy Trinity and of the one substance of divinity, which is equally and similarly and immutably in three hypostases? For will we impiously say that God the Word, because He undertook union to flesh endowed with soul and mind, fell into diversity of substance, or departed from His own eternity or glory or royal dignity or virtue or will?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For this is division of substance, as has already been shown through the inspired words of the Doctors. But the Son suffered nothing of this sort, because He is God and always is and is with God and is never separated, according to kinship of substance, from the Father or from the Spirit, on account of which, remaining what He was, immutably and infinitely, He assumed what He was not, that is, our humanity, in conjunction and union according to hypostasis, ineffably and as He alone knows. What therefore is the division which you suspect? Explain to us, O Grammarian: do you suspect that to be division and section of substance, that we do not confess the whole substance, that is, of divinity, comprehensive of three hypostases, to be incarnate? For that indeed looks to you, which you say, namely, that the union of inhumanation is "of two substances" and "according to common notion," so that the holy Trinity follows incarnate to the whole humanity and substance of our whole genus. For again that absurdity occurs to you, who are included in the narrows of your poverty of reasonings as in straits. But, while you flee from saying the Father Himself or the Holy Spirit is incarnate, you assert that the whole divinity is in the hypostasis of the Son, but know that you slide unwittingly into the same impiety. For the Son Himself is not the whole divinity, but one hypostasis from three hypostases, in which is the whole divinity. For neither the hypostasis of the Father nor of the Holy Spirit is confounded with the Son Himself. For although in the Son as in a living and indifferent image is manifested and seen the very exemplar, which is the Father, nevertheless the image itself is not therefore other according to hypostasis than the exemplar, nor are both contracted into one hypostasis. For of whom will it be an image, unless the exemplar is separate according to hypostasis, to which the image also has the indifference of the highest similitude? For nothing is an image of itself, but altogether of another, just as also something is said to be consubstantial to another, but not to itself, as the wise Basil also said writing to the canonical: BASIL: "For nothing is consubstantial to itself, but one to another."<sup><a href="#fn252" id="fn252-ref">252</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">With vain labors therefore you think to honor piety when you say: "not as if the Father is the Son or the Son is the Father,"<sup><a href="#fn253" id="fn253-ref">253</a></sup> as you are caught confounding the hypostases saying: "In Christ is the whole divinity and the whole humanity,"<sup><a href="#fn254" id="fn254-ref">254</a></sup> and thus impiously gathering that Christ is in two substances according to generic signification, so that from that subtle confusion the whole substance of divinity, which is the holy Trinity, is found incarnate to the whole substance of humanity and the whole human genus. For this is the genetic signification of substances, that substance is comprehensive of many hypostases, not that one hypostasis partakes of the same substance with homogeneous hypostases, as that man partakes of humanity; otherwise, the hypostasis will also be found to be substance, because it partakes of substance: which is simultaneously most ridiculous and approaches impiety. And thus to you who, as opinion is, have conducted yourself wisely, as the prophet Micah said, night will come from vision and darkness from divination—for these your things are divination and conjecture of peril—and the sun will set for you, and day will be darkened over you, and confusion, as of those dreaming: for dreams also are your tenebrous opinions, which will also be derided and against which all will speak, because there will be none who hear them.<sup><a href="#fn255" id="fn255-ref">255</a></sup> And you have suffered the same, while you change and turn yourself to impiety and flee the reprehension of insanity and again slide into it, which that one also suffered, of whom some other prophet said: "How as if a man flees from the face of a lion and falls upon the bear, and rushes into his house and leans his hand on the wall and a serpent bites him."<sup><a href="#fn256" id="fn256-ref">256</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TWENTY</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>Cyril's doctrine concerning substance and hypostasis, by which is detected the impiety and madness and blasphemy.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Hear truly—if indeed you wish: for again we will speak to you with submissive voice—those things which are held from the inspired voice of the Fathers, and the eminent doctor Cyril, teaching that the identity of substance in the holy Trinity does not induce commixtion of hypostases, and that the substance is comprehensive of singular hypostases. For he wrote in the first oration of the treatise on the holy and consubstantial Trinity dictated to a certain Hermias, and composed through question and response, thus: CYRIL: "But it has natural and ineffable unity, not some confusion among the hypostases suffering among themselves, as it seemed to some, that the same is the Father and the Son, but with each existing and subsisting and said to have proper existence, the identity of substance preserves unity. — B. In proper substance therefore you say the Son is besides the substance of the Father? — A. Not certainly in another substance besides that which is His as God, but in hypostasis which is as Son. — B. Therefore substance is one thing and hypostasis another? — A. Yes. For the difference and what intervenes is greater, since substance is comprehensive of singular three. — B. How do you say? For I am ignorant, as is known, in such things. — A. Do you not know that to me also the discourse concerning these things is not trite? But nevertheless we must approach the investigation, as can be done, as in a certain image, since the divine eminence is in the highest sublimities. Therefore, the signification of substance seems to be of something common; but the name of hypostasis is predicated and said of each one of those things which subsist under this common. Suppose now we show that. — B. Of what sort is that? — A. We define man as a rational and mortal animal, as if describing Him with reason fitting to Him; and we say this to be the definition of substance, which passes to each one of those who subsist singly. Therefore under this common, that is, man or the definition of man, fall, I think, Thomas and Marcus, or, as can be said, Peter and Paul. And the signification of substance thus made the notion of each of those who are conceived singly, not yet manifest and clear. For not yet whatever is simply man, that is Peter and Paul. But saying Thomas or Peter, one does not remove him who is understood from the definition of man—for he is no less man—but shows him existing in a certain such species and in special hypostasis and partially. Therefore substance will be understood more fittingly of every man, bringing forth the common reason of genus, but hypostasis of one, not excluding from commonality that which is understood, nor again confounding and mixing it with others, so that now does not appear that which is had singly and specially."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Since therefore substance, as you heard from the Doctor, is comprehensive of singular hypostases which fall under it, on account of homogeneity, bringing forth the common reason of genus, cease to blaspheme and think impiously that there is a hypostatic union of substances, which is the incarnation of God the Word, one from three hypostases, not commixed with consubstantial hypostases, namely of the Father and of the Holy Spirit, but subsisting separately, although conjoined by kinship of substance; which hypostasis of the Son is incarnate to one flesh endowed with soul and mind, which is from the holy ever-virgin God-bearing Mary, and which falls under the substance of the whole humanity and has us all consubstantial, who are disposed under this very genus and this very substance. For He took hold of the seed of Abraham and was made like us in all things, to us and His brothers without sin.<sup><a href="#fn257" id="fn257-ref">257</a></sup> For the hypostasis, although it partakes of the substance itself fully and perfectly and is not excluded from the limits of substance, and partakes of it in the same way as other congeneric hypostases, nevertheless is not therefore deemed to be the whole substance comprehensive of all hypostases. For substance indeed has the common reason of genus, since it comprehends every hypostasis included by homogeneity; but hypostasis holds the place of species, insofar as it subsists distinctly and separately, but is comprehended under substance and referred to it with homogeneous hypostases: it itself comprehends nothing; nor does it confound and mix consubstantial hypostases with itself because it is bound with them by kinship.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore it has been shown by those things which have been examined, and confirmed as if by a seal with the testimonies of the deiferous doctors, that in the divine incarnation and inhumanation there has been made a hypostatic union and composition and natural congregation not of substances, but of the one hypostasis of God the Word to one flesh, manifestly animated by rational soul: for substances according to common signification are comprehensive of many hypostases. But since everywhere you have confessed Emmanuel in two natures, that is, united substantially, and are said to understand the substances not as special hypostases, but according to common signification: that which is gathered is nothing else than that you assert this substance, comprehensive of three hypostases, to be incarnate to the whole substance of humanity, embracing each and all men.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That, where we rightly confess Emmanuel from two natures, we neither say Him from two substances, insofar as He is conceived in conjunction and according to commonality of substance, nor again from two persons, as this impious one vainly calumniating suspects us.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">So much, however, does stupor of mind occupy you, that you have taken care to corroborate from our opinion that word which is already stupid and exceeds all blasphemy and malice simultaneously. For what also do you say, as a strong and wonderful and altogether sincere and by no means constrained dictum? THE GRAMMARIAN: "How truly shall we also say Christ 'from two natures,' if 'natures' are not understood by them in place of 'substances'? For they will not dare to say that name is accepted for hypostases marked by character. But if they do, they will be forced to say Christ also 'from two persons,' for hypostasis marked by character provides understanding of person. I say hypostasis marked by character lest, following the custom of heretical deceit, they establish hypostasis lacking character; for then hypostasis assumes the signification of substance. How truly do they establish Christ consubstantial with the Father and consubstantial with us, and do not cease to confess two consubstantial, but deny two substances?"</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Then, tell me if we agree to think with you beyond what is to be thought and say Christ is from two substances according to common signification, and stupidly understand the substance of the holy Trinity to be composite with the whole substance of humanity, will you persist in the same error and think that on account of our infirmities that which is yours is strong? But know clearly, O strenuous one, that you do not wisely shun the same insanity. For confessing Christ to be from two natures, we say He is from the one hypostasis of God the Word and from one flesh animated by rational soul, but not from two substances understood according to generic and common signification. For those, comprehensive of many hypostases, lead also to your inebriation, namely to the opinion which establishes with blasphemy the holy Trinity incarnate to the whole human genus. For this is substance according to common signification, not that which the hypostasis partakes of substance. For, because Paul perfectly partakes of that which is common, of the substance of humanity, he is not therefore rightly deemed to be the whole substance of humanity. So also God the Word Himself, one hypostasis, because He united to Himself one flesh animated by rational soul, and partakes of the common substance of humanity, will not therefore be deemed composite with the whole human genus.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">How truly have you presumed to ignore that we, when about to say Emmanuel from two natures, do not understand natures as substances significative of commonality and comprehensive of many hypostases, but the one hypostasis of the Word Himself and one flesh rationally animated, from which, and indeed immutably, He is compacted and composite, and exists as one nature and one hypostasis of the incarnate Word, so that thence we are forced to say the union is also made from two persons? Have you read the epistle to Maron written by me? For in that epistle is placed the proposition which the adversary objects and its solution is brought forth with these words: for it is useful to place those things that we may show both that we say nothing new but constantly hold the same sound opinion, and that you wish in vain to do evil and fix the eye of your mind in the darkness of impiety, but do not wish to regard the splendor of truth. They are thus: The adversary always objects to us: PROPOSITION OF THE HERETICS: "What therefore? You, saying 'from two natures' and 'from two hypostases,' also say Emmanuel to be 'from two persons.'" To this also we say: When hypostases are found in proper and separate subsistence, then each hypostasis is circumcluded by its own person; but when from the concurrence of two natures one natural union is made, and one nature and hypostasis is absolved without confusion—as it is permitted to see man similar to us—now those natures and hypostases, from which that nature and hypostasis are had, do not appear under proper characters, nor with two persons, but even when they are circumcluded by person. And that indeed has been demonstrated from the things considered above; nevertheless, for perfect instruction I will also place other words of Saint Cyril. For in the second epistle to Nestorius he wrote thus: CYRIL: "Therefore it is not fitting to divide into two sons the one Lord Jesus Christ. But it in no way profits right reason of faith to think thus, although some divulge union of persons. For Scripture did not say the Word united to Himself the person of a man, but to have been made flesh. But that the Word was made flesh is nothing else than that He communicated in the same way as we in blood and flesh. But He made our body His own and was born a man from a woman, that He left behind that which He is as God and that which is by nature from God the Father, but also in the assumption of flesh remaining what He was."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">We placed these words in the epistle to Maron, which clearly show those who think the Word united to Himself the person of a man to be saying two persons and two sons and christs and hypostases and natures. Moreover, those say this who first fashion the infant in the womb of the Virgin and concede a time in which it subsisted in its own subsistence, and thus make God the Word dwell in it by an affection of conjunction, and through this they divulge a union according to person, or rather they abolish the union from the true reason of faith. And it is easy to see how the wise Cyril shows the impious Diodorus speaking in a certain place, in those things which he wrote against him by divine inspiration: DIODORUS: "When the flesh of Mary was not yet assumed, it was from the earth, and it did not differ from other fleshes. For just as Levi was tithed while he was in the loins<sup><a href="#fn258" id="fn258-ref">258</a></sup>, and after he was born he received dignity: so also the Lord, when in the womb of the Virgin and from her substance, did not have the dignity of Sonship; but when He was formed and became a temple of God the Word, receiving the Only-begotten, He assumed the dignity of the name and participated in that very dignity."<sup><a href="#fn259" id="fn259-ref">259</a></sup> To which also he who, according to apostolic testimony, is powerful to refute those who contradict the preaching of the gospel<sup><a href="#fn260" id="fn260-ref">260</a></sup>, says: CYRIL: "O excellent one, I will say, who labor with very unlearned and subtle twisted words! Indeed, that holy body was made from Mary, but from the first; from the beginnings of concretion or subsistence in the womb it was holy, as the body of Christ; nor can anyone perceive any time in which it was not His, but rather a common body, as you said, and in equality with other fleshes."<sup><a href="#fn261" id="fn261-ref">261</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, to the hypostatic union and natural conjunction pertains this, that we say this flesh endowed with soul and mind, which was conceived in the most pure womb of the God-bearing Virgin, subsisted in the very union with God the Word and received the beginning of concretion, so that concurrently with the union to the Word ages ago the flesh was brought to existence.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For thus He is understood to be conceived, who is incarnate and united to flesh, which by its own nature can be conceived, and He Himself through time the perfect conception, who was born according to the flesh: for the phrase "was made flesh" in the very Word, according to His nature, devoid of flesh, presents the understanding that the flesh subsisted and gradually came to growth and to human form, and by no means came to subsistence outside of union to Himself. For indeed the holy martyr and bishop of Alexandria Peter also teaches thus writing in the book on divinity: PETER: "Whence also the evangelist asserts the truth saying: 'The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us'<sup><a href="#fn262" id="fn262-ref">262</a></sup>, namely, from when the angel saluted the Virgin and said: 'Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you'<sup><a href="#fn263" id="fn263-ref">263</a></sup>. For this phrase 'the Lord is with you' we now hear pronounced by Gabriel in place of 'God the Word is with you'; for it signifies Him to be made in the womb and to be made flesh, as it is written: 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy one who is born will be called the Son of God.'<sup><a href="#fn264" id="fn264-ref">264</a></sup>" AND AGAIN, AFTER OTHER THINGS: "God the Word, however, in the absence of a man, by the will of God, who can do all things, was made flesh in the womb of the Virgin, without the operation and presence of a man having been present. For the power of God worked more than a man, when with the Holy Spirit, who came upon her, He overshadowed the Virgin."<sup><a href="#fn265" id="fn265-ref">265</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">The mystery therefore through the inspired Scripture and through the voice of the theological Doctors, who explained it, signifies to us that the infant did not subsist in its own subsistence and, separately, nor was it conceived, according to the vain thought of the heretics, in the womb of the God-bearing Virgin Mary, but the Word Himself ages ago, from the beginning and inseparable time of concretion and constitution in the womb, united to Himself flesh endowed with soul and mind, when it came to existence and subsistence, and that the time of the flesh's coming to existence and of union to God the Word is one. And in this according to the flesh He is understood to be made an infant without change, whose, if I may say so, nature is most perfect. And we necessarily say the one person is the Word Himself ages ago, immutably incarnate and inhumanate, and again one hypostasis and one nature of the Word incarnate, but not two persons, nor two hypostases, nor two natures, because the Word did not unite to Himself any person of a man previously fashioned in the womb of the God-bearing Virgin Mary, but rather He Himself through the dispensation on account of mercy was made man.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>How the formula "Christ is from two natures or hypostases" is conceived and said, and offers the contemplation of the difference of those things which are gathered into one without defect to be considered only according to thought in the composition, and at the same time after the thought of the union it flees from all duality, introduced by the impious, of substances and persons and natures and hypostases.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And when we say Christ Himself is from two natures or hypostases, we say this as if separating by thought alone those things from which He is or is naturally compacted. For we do not speak thus as if a duality had first existed, of hypostases, and then they were compacted into one hypostasis: for this is simultaneously incarnational and impossible. For those things which subsist singly and separately and are in duality, how can they be compacted into one hypostasis? That therefore which subsists as one from composition without change from things diverse in species and substance—such is man similar to us, composed from soul and body—is indeed in one hypostasis; but presenting itself to be seen by intellect alone separating, it shows itself to be compacted from two natures, but it does not subsist in two natures or hypostases. For it cannot be seen that both subsist in their own subsistence, but it appears only from the composition that one hypostasis is absolved from two things among themselves.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Let the wise Cyril, inspired by the Spirit, illustrate and at the same time confirm that opinion, who shows that we, where with subtle contemplation alone we separate those things from which is the one and only Christ, say the union of two natures or hypostases to be made; but where we apprehend the union with separation and division as if by thought made, we no longer say "two" after the thought of the union, because they do not subsist separately and in their own subsistence, but from both is one nature and hypostasis of the Word incarnate. And so in the first epistle to Succensus he wrote thus: CYRIL: "But when we consider this, we do nothing to prevent the concurrence into unity, saying Him to be made from two natures; after the union, however, we do not separate the natures from each other, nor do we cut the one and indivisible into two sons, but we say one Son and, as we have said, one nature of the Word incarnate. And so as far as it pertains to thought and to contemplating only, with the eyes of the soul how He was inhumanated, we say there are two natures, which are united, but one Christ and Lord and Son of God the Word inhumanated and incarnate."<sup><a href="#fn266" id="fn266-ref">266</a></sup> Similarly also, in the epistle to Acacius, bishop of Melitene, he says these things: CYRIL: "Therefore, apprehending as if in thoughts those things from which is the one and only Son and Lord Jesus Christ, we indeed say two natures to be united; but, after the union, as if the division into two has now been removed, we believe there is one nature of the Son, as of one, but inhumanated and incarnate."<sup><a href="#fn267" id="fn267-ref">267</a></sup> AND AGAIN, AFTER OTHER THINGS: "For one is most certainly the nature of the Word, but we know it to be incarnate and inhumanate. But how it is incarnate and inhumanate if anyone inquires more curiously, he will see God the Word, who is from God, to have assumed the form of a servant and to have been made in the likeness of men, as it is written.<sup><a href="#fn268" id="fn268-ref">268</a></sup> And according to this alone can the difference of nature or hypostasis be understood; for divinity and humanity are not the same according to natural quality: if otherwise, how the Word, when He was God, was made, and lowered Himself to inferior things, that is, to ours?"<sup><a href="#fn269" id="fn269-ref">269</a></sup> In the second epistle to Succensus, however, proceeding with the same free opinions and words, he wrote thus: CYRIL: "But let man similar to us again be an example for us. For we understand two natures also concerning him, one of soul, the other of body. But separating by mere thoughts and apprehending the difference with subtle contemplations or phantasms of the intellect, we do not place the natures apart, nor again do we at all permit the power of division into them, but we understand them to be one, so that those two natures are not now two, but from both one animal is absolved."<sup><a href="#fn270" id="fn270-ref">270</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Is it not evident to anyone hearing these things prudently that the person indeed is one, namely the one and only Lord and God Jesus Christ, and one nature and hypostasis of God the Word incarnate? But if he considers those things from which Christ is or is naturally composed, he will also, as far as possible, with subtle contemplation only and, as can be seen, with the eyes of the mind and intellect perceive and gather the difference of those things which are gathered among themselves, he will see the natural essence of two natures; and at the same time, illuminated by the power of union and finding those things not to subsist in composition and by no means in their own subsistence, but to have absolved one hypostasis and one nature of the Word incarnate, he will not be able to say those things which in contemplation were seen as two, to be two according to hypostasis. For the thought of union averts and destroys the power of division, so that these two are not now two, but from both through ineffability one is absolved according to composition. And indeed the natures and hypostases, from which Christ is composed, are seen without defect and immutably in union, but to each of them a person cannot be acknowledged, because they do not subsist separately and in their own subsistence and in duality, but from each is one hypostasis and consequently one person and one nature of God the Word incarnate.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Thus we have clearly shown how, saying from two natures, we do not understand those natures to be substances according to common signification, which are comprehensive of many hypostases, so that, according to the stupidity of your impiety, the holy Trinity is found incarnate to the whole humanity and the whole human genus, but we understand the one hypostasis of God the Word, which is separated only according to contemplation, and the one hypostasis of flesh rationally animated and assumed from the God-bearing Virgin, in composition without change, and indeed remaining what they were, by no means subsisting in their own subsistence, as we have often said, and in duality of natures, but through concurrence into one to have absolved one nature and hypostasis of the Word incarnate, and one person.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That to hypostases, when they subsist singly and separately, special persons are attributed, but when those hypostases concur to natural union and absolve one from two hypostases, they have one person.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For that it is proper to hypostases subsisting in their own subsistence and separately, that two persons are attributed to them, the sacred voice of Cyril, approved as rightly and with just weight and, to use the Scriptural phrase, as sanctified, weighing great things<sup><a href="#fn271" id="fn271-ref">271</a></sup>, proceeding into the midst will again clearly show. In the epistle to Valerian he wrote in this way: CYRIL: "But again show your attentive ear to me; that one keen for contemplations and cunning for calumnies, and says: 'If one is he who inhabits, but similarly another is he in whom he is said to inhabit, how is it not necessary that the hypostases be divided and each be said to remain and subsist apart?' Then where, I ask, is the one person? For he pretends to say one person of Christ, but with two hypostases placed per se and separately, certainly also two persons enter. But entering as legislators they firmly and completely establish that which seems to them to be rightly held. For they say: 'Separating the hypostases, we unite the person.' And how is this not incredible and unbelief and impossible?"<sup><a href="#fn272" id="fn272-ref">272</a></sup> Moreover, the same Doctor, who here said to hypostases subsisting separately and properly and disjunctly two persons are consequently attributed, but not one, as those say who follow the opinion of Nestorius, collecting the homonymy of sonship and equality of dignity of those persons, we will know from the things which will be appended that in hypostatic and natural union the hypostases or natures, from which is the one and only Christ, appear unconfused, and that from two one nature and hypostasis of the Word incarnate is absolved. For thus he wrote in the Scholia: CYRIL: "But that the natures or hypostases remained unconfused, we will know from this: for the gold, which was mixed with wood, remained what it was, and the wood was indeed said to be adorned by the gold, but it did not cease to be wood. Moreover, that the ark is assumed as a type of Christ can be established by many words: for it preceded the children of Israel, seeking rest for them. For also the little child and Christ says: 'I go and prepare a place for you.'<sup><a href="#fn273" id="fn273-ref">273</a></sup>" And when he wrote the scholion, to which these sentences are subjoined, he inscribed thus: CYRIL: "That, what is conjoined into true union is the Word with humanity, the hypostases remained unconfused."<sup><a href="#fn274" id="fn274-ref">274</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">How therefore, O rebel against such manifest incredulity, from the rule constituted by yourself, do you dare to say and write, with those things which befit you, the darkness and fallacious obscurity: THE GRAMMARIAN: "For hypostasis marked by character provides understanding of person. But I say hypostasis marked by character lest, following the customary fallacy of heretics, they establish hypostasis lacking character: for then hypostasis assumes the signification of substance."<sup><a href="#fn275" id="fn275-ref">275</a></sup>? And so by your Prudence the wise Cyril is ascribed to the heretics, who said the hypostases, from which is Emmanuel, remained unconfused, and those in two persons marked by character: he does not separate them, as you have done, where in composition among themselves, but not in their own subsistence and separately they subsist, but in one hypostasis from each and one nature of the Word incarnate! But you say that those hypostases, which appear in composition, we ought not to call hypostases, but substances. Therefore as to the propriety of words the Doctor erred, and to him your diligence of correction is owed: But we also will follow you and immediately employ an interpreter.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And so explain to us who ask how we ought to understand the hypostasis of the Word, of the Son, of the Splendor, of the Character of the paternal hypostasis, of the Image, not to be a hypostasis, but substance, because the substance of divinity according to common signification is comprehensive of three hypostases, but not, because the hypostases immutably participate substance, it is permitted to think the hypostasis of the Father or of the Spirit to be poured out in the Son; but how we cannot again think that one flesh animated by rational soul to be substance according to common signification: for it is not itself comprehensive of many hypostases, nor does the fact that it participates the same substance and humanity and therefore we are consubstantial with it, expel it from that which is hypostasis. For substance indeed holds the reason of genus comprehending homogeneous substances; but hypostasis holds the reason of one species, which subsists under substance and partakes perfectly and without defect of that which is common, of substance. But we say these things following your opinions. For you are seen to assert one Christ to be two natures hypostatically united, that is, substances according to common signification. But this common signification knows those substances to be comprehensive of many hypostases, as the discourse scrutinizing has amply shown, but by no means does it know hypostasis to be participant of this, which is common, of substance. For "each one of us participates being through the common reason of substance," as the wise in divine things Basil wrote in the epistle to Terentius<sup><a href="#fn276" id="fn276-ref">276</a></sup>! Therefore each of the hypostases participates substance, but substance itself can be participated, which comprehends all hypostases participating it in equality of dignity also through common reason of genus. For each one of us participates common humanity and the one substance superior to all, and is one man and one hypostasis. Nevertheless, not because he participates substance, is he to be called not hypostasis but substance: for he participates, but that can be participated, and he indeed is comprehended, but it comprehends in itself all hypostases of individuals.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore declare to us—for again we approach to interrogate you—how we ought to understand the hypostasis of God the Word as substance according to common signification, but how also that one flesh endowed with soul and mind, which the Word united to Himself hypostatically, we ought to say substance, again according to common signification. For behold the holy Cyril, disdaining your clever propriety of words, writing to Nestorius, in the third chapter of the anathematisms, who especially knows how to speak properly, writes these things: CYRIL: "If anyone in one Christ separates the hypostases after the union, joining them by conjunction only according to dignity or authority, and not rather by that congregation which is according to natural union, let him be anathema."<sup><a href="#fn277" id="fn277-ref">277</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">To those therefore who, as divine Scripture said, have ears for hearing<sup><a href="#fn278" id="fn278-ref">278</a></sup> and constant mind, there is no need of clarity from these words, for the reprehension of your spontaneous loquacity and for the demonstration of truth. But, because it has completely pleased you to be of the impious flock, and that which you have devised in your mind, which the necks of those who fight against God deserve<sup><a href="#fn279" id="fn279-ref">279</a></sup>: "Peace will not be, because I, in the hardness of my heart, will walk"<sup><a href="#fn280" id="fn280-ref">280</a></sup>, and you have hardened your face upon a rock and refused to receive discipline<sup><a href="#fn281" id="fn281-ref">281</a></sup>, you proceed into the midst; and though you know nothing from yourself, you contend to explain with audacity even those things which are so manifest in sentences and in words, bringing forth the same fables. For to us in the little book of laments you wrote these things:</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That he unlearnedly and audaciously distorts the words of holy Cyril, and says the hypostatic conjunction according to natural union is the union of substances according to common signification.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">[THE GRAMMARIAN]: "Moreover, let this not escape them, that the word 'hypostasis' is very often understood by the holy Fathers for 'substance,' as also pleases holy Cyril. For in the third anathema he says: 'If anyone in one Christ divides the hypostases after the union.'<sup><a href="#fn282" id="fn282-ref">282</a></sup> For he does not signify here the word hypostasis as subsistent: for that deiferous man, who continually fought against the blasphemies of Nestorius, would not have named hypostases in Christ if he had not accepted those hypostases for substances."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Consider, you who have heard these things and who hear, how great is the poverty and what sort is the audacity, and how, failing in these very things and in audacious words, he is not ashamed in his turpitude. For indeed there is no time to use also the words of Jeremiah, who knew and understood concerning those who proffer such things, as they were worthy: "They are confused because they have done abomination; but neither are they at all ashamed, nor have they known their folly; therefore they shall fall in their ruin and in the time of their visitation they shall perish, says the Lord."<sup><a href="#fn283" id="fn283-ref">283</a></sup> Behold therefore, O excellent one, the visitation of your foul and most audacious follies has also approached and destruction has risen against them. For where have you produced the wise Cyril saying: "I understand or said hypostases for substances"? As if someone named a man, you would say a horse is also named by him. Therefore I will not hesitate, for the reprehension of your audacious garrulity, to append again the anathematism itself integrally: CYRIL: "If anyone in one Christ divides the hypostases after the union, joining them by conjunction only according to dignity or authority, and not rather by that congregation which is according to natural union, let him be anathema."<sup><a href="#fn284" id="fn284-ref">284</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Show, O good one, from these words that it pleases Cyril, as you said, in the natural union of Emmanuel to understand hypostases for substances. But indeed it does not please him: for if it had pleased, he would have said it, for what was there to prohibit him from saying? Therefore, to you alone this pleases, O impious claimant, who falsely say and conjecture from his sentence, and you utter these vain words: THE GRAMMARIAN: "For neither would that deiferous man, who always fought against the blasphemies of Nestorius, have named hypostases in one Christ if he had not accepted them for substances."<sup><a href="#fn285" id="fn285-ref">285</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">What therefore, O strenuous and subtle interpreter? Because Nestorius in many places named two natures, dividing the one Christ, will we inconsiderately say, following your divination, which is not divination, that holy Cyril did not confess Christ to be from two natures, or that he understands natures as substances? Or where does he appear to have written to him: "You indeed, O Nestorius, understand natures as hypostases, but I as substances"? Show him to have written this somewhere in his writings, and you will conquer us without any controversy. But just as Cyril here rebuked Nestorius erring and saying two natures, in the same way he vituperated him again saying one Christ to be two hypostases, because he was found necessarily asserting two persons, and two sons and christs, which according to dignity alone, and homonymy of sonship and authority, as he said, and likewise according to virtue he joined. And just as he demanded from him to confess the natural hypostatic union, so also of natures, since he acknowledged no difference between nature and hypostasis because one hypostasis—one from the Trinity, not the Trinity—hypostatically united to Himself one flesh, from Mary the God-bearer born and endowed with soul and mind—not the whole substance and the whole genus of humanity—nor was the natural conjunction made from substances according to common signification, as you say. For one nature and hypostasis of the Word incarnate is, and only for contemplating with the eyes of the soul those things from which Christ is or is naturally composed, we consider, as can be done, two natures or hypostases in ineffable and unconfused concurrence; because the flesh rationally animated subsists in the very union to the Word, nor does the union permit, after the thought of the insecable and God-worthy and reason-surpassing union, division into two, so that which two were seen in thought, are now not two, but one nature absolved from both is shown, namely the nature of the Son Himself inhumanated and incarnate.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Again we can from the very words of holy Cyril openly and most clearly show that he demanded from Nestorius to confess the union indeed of natures, but also of hypostases, as if the concretion of flesh united hypostatically to the Word were made, but not of substances according to common signification. For he wrote, in the second tome against the blasphemies of the unclean Nestorius, thus: CYRIL: "But indeed the inventor of new piety, although he may say one Christ in pretence, separates indeed everywhere the natures and establishes each singly, asserting them not however to be united among themselves; but, making a pretext in sins, as it is written<sup><a href="#fn286" id="fn286-ref">286</a></sup>, he devises a certain mode of adherence, according to equality of dignity only, as I said, as also is shown from his words; and indeed the indwelling of God through participation, as in a holy man, he divides the Word from God, so that he sometimes attributes the evangelical words to the Word alone and properly considered, sometimes properly to Him who is from a woman. However, how is it not indubitable to all that, since He was God according to nature, the Only-begotten was made man, not by adherence simply extrinsically devised or affective, as he says, but by true union ineffably and above intellect? And so He is conceived as one and only; but every word is fitting to Him and as if from one person all are said; for one nature is now conceived after the union, namely the nature of the Word incarnate."<sup><a href="#fn287" id="fn287-ref">287</a></sup> Behold he vituperates Nestorius because the natures, which he divides, he does not say to be gathered into union. For what does he also say? CYRIL: "But asserting them not to be gathered among themselves"<sup><a href="#fn288" id="fn288-ref">288</a></sup>; and immediately he shows that Nestorius indeed, when he divides those natures and joins them only according to dignity, makes them persons separated by division, and each subsisting per se; but he, when he considers those ineffably and above intellect united and subsisting in composition, but not separately in duality, knows one person, and one nature of the Word incarnate, nor did he say: "I understand natures as substances according to common signification."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But it must be considered how he also demanded that the blasphemer himself confess true union. For he wrote in the same tome, after a little, also these things: CYRIL: "But that one of those decrepit, having nothing sound in his mind, labored with immoderate impiety, dividing Christ into two persons and into two hypostases completely divided among themselves, and properly attributes to each of them the words fitting to them; and again says one Christ Jesus Lord, as a man adhering to God according to dignity only, but not by true union, that is, natural union. How therefore is He one Christ and Son and Lord, if it is fitting to both, as you divided, that thus they are named and truly are, when they are by no means conjoint according to hypostatic union, but are united according to dignity or authority or power only?"<sup><a href="#fn289" id="fn289-ref">289</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And again, in the same tome, he acknowledges the natures, from which Emmanuel is, not as substances according to generic signification, but as hypostases, and likewise calls them sometimes hypostases sometimes natures, which indeed divided into duality are understood in two persons, but appearing in natural and true union absolve one nature and hypostasis from two, namely the nature and hypostasis of the Son incarnate and inhumanate: CYRIL: "Cease to divide the natures after the union. For that the divine and human nature are one thing and another I say it is fitting and necessary for prudent men to know—for they differ among themselves, and by inestimable differences;—but, where you have introduced concerning the Savior of all of us Christ true and hypostatic union, refuse division: for thus confessing one Christ and Son and Lord." AND AGAIN, AFTER OTHER THINGS: "It was necessary therefore, if he was a wise and sagacious man, to say that body indeed from a woman, but again to confess that body, by hypostatic union conjoined with the Word, to have absolved one Christ and Son and Lord, the same God and man."<sup><a href="#fn290" id="fn290-ref">290</a></sup> Again, in the third tome, he says: CYRIL: "Therefore with hypostases, as you say, divided into two, and understood to exist apart and privately, how does congress into one person occur, unless one be said to be proper of the other, as at least the body of man is understood proper to his soul, although it is of diverse nature from it: for soul and body are not the same."<sup><a href="#fn291" id="fn291-ref">291</a></sup> That therefore also must be considered, how he writes concerning the hypostases themselves, which Nestorius, dividing them, makes two persons, holy Cyril says that, if we understand them naturally united among themselves in that way in which the soul of man is united to its proper body, although of diverse nature from it, then it can be that we name one person absolved from each, as one hypostasis and nature of the Word incarnate.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And so by all these things it is most clearly shown that the natural union has been made of particular hypostases, namely the hypostasis of God the Word and that one flesh, from the God-bearing Virgin born, animated by rational soul, but not of substances according to common signification, which comprehend many hypostases. Where therefore, O most impious and with impiety audacious and unlearned Grammarian, shall we place your interpretation saying: THE GRAMMARIAN: "For neither would that deiferous man, who continually fought against the blasphemies of Nestorius, have named hypostases in one Christ if he had not accepted those hypostases for substances"?<sup><a href="#fn292" id="fn292-ref">292</a></sup> For manifestly you have heard him, when he contended against Nestorius, saying: "Therefore with hypostases, as you say"<sup><a href="#fn293" id="fn293-ref">293</a></sup>, and demanding that Nestorius confess the natural union of the hypostases themselves; nor did he say: "Come, O Nestorius, confessing the union not of substances but of hypostases, you divide the one Christ!" as you, O Grammarian, say the union of hypostases indeed to be mendacious and habitual, but the union of substances to be true and hypostatic. But such a thing nowhere appears Cyril to have spoken: whence, he did not say it. For he knew the natural union to have been made not of substances according to generic signification, but of the one hypostasis of the Word to one flesh endowed with soul and mind. And hear him again in the fourth tome writing these things: CYRIL: "And although indeed the Word has dwelt and still dwells in all the saints, but once He was made in ours and communicated to one flesh according to hypostasis, in which He is believed to have died and risen again for us."<sup><a href="#fn294" id="fn294-ref">294</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Who could pass over you proceeding from such manifest and all these evident reasons, and attend to you effusing those impious things as if something new (although the union of substances according to common signification were made)?</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That when this impious one asserted the union of Emmanuel to be of substances according to common signification, from ignorance he did not notice that he falls and errs into a habitual union for the natural union.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">For if according to common signification the substance of divinity indeed is comprehensive of three hypostases of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, but the substance of humanity is comprehensive of hypostases of all men, and you say the union of substances is made: then you are found choosing a habitual union for the hypostatic union, and inducing it to us with the inebriety of sophisms. Know indeed, know manifestly—and now you are not drunk with wine, as the prophet said<sup><a href="#fn295" id="fn295-ref">295</a></sup>—that to those, to whom the Only-begotten Son of God became consubstantial with us and was hypostatically united to one flesh rationally animated, the whole human substance and the whole human genus is united according to habit to the divine nature, to which it was previously adverse, and thus, as it is written, we are made partakers of the divine nature<sup><a href="#fn296" id="fn296-ref">296</a></sup>; deemed worthy of pristine peace and rest and enriched with participation of divine goods and immortal fire, from which we had fallen by the transgression of Adam. Which again the excellent Doctor, in the third tome against the blasphemies of Nestorius, thus teaches: CYRIL: "However, how was it not sufficient to say, or rather also to prefer to think, that He was indeed sent and became consubstantial with us, that is, was made man, but remained consubstantial with God and the Father? He is conceived and was and is God. For He is, He is what He was, even when He assumed humanity; but He has identity of substance with the Father, who is in the heavens, and God wisely assumed our likeness also; but He is also a mediator, per se collecting to habitual unity those things which were completely separated. For when He was by nature God, according to truth He was made man, that we also may be named a genus not now of that first, that is, earthly, to whom it was said by God: 'You are earth, and to earth you shall return'<sup><a href="#fn297" id="fn297-ref">297</a></sup>, who also transmitted into death, but of that second, who is from above and from heaven, in Christ, I say, who lifts us to immutable life and shows incorruptible: that which was held by death, and He freed from sins that which was entangled in the snares of sin. So somewhere the Father Himself said to the Son: 'Behold I have given you as a covenant of the race, as a light of the nations, to open the eyes of the blind, to lead out from bonds those bound, from the prison house those sitting in...'<sup><a href="#fn298" id="fn298-ref">298</a></sup> Attend: and again through the voice of Isaiah: 'The beasts of the field will bless me, the sirens and daughters of ostriches; because I have given water in the desert and rivers in the dry land, to give drink to my chosen race, the people whom I have acquired to narrate my virtues.'<sup><a href="#fn299" id="fn299-ref">299</a></sup>" In the fifth tome, however, the same shows in the same way: CYRIL: "But we through Him are shown to be partakers of the divine nature, and who previously were made far off are made near, through Him united with the Father according to habit, and again He made us one in one faith and concord of soul because we have been made partakers of one Spirit, and He says to the Father, who is in the heavens, and God: 'I pray not only for these, but also for those who through their word believe in me, that all may be one, as you, Father, in me and I in you, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that you sent me. And the glory which you gave me I have given to them, that they may be one as we are one, I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected in one.'<sup><a href="#fn300" id="fn300-ref">300</a></sup>" Athanasius, however, the Star of truth, in the work against the Arians, in the fourth oration, wrote in concord with these things thus: ATHANASIUS: "Whence, when the flesh was born from the God-bearing Mary, He is said to be born, who gives to it birth, that He may transfer our birth into Himself, so that we, as earth alone, may not go into earth, but as conjoined with the heavenly Word, may be lifted up by Him."<sup><a href="#fn301" id="fn301-ref">301</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, when these wise mystagogues teach us these things, it is evident that God the Word, one from three hypostases, united to Himself flesh endowed with soul and mind hypostatically or naturally; but the substance of the whole humanity understood according to common signification, that is, the whole human genus, acquired conjunction of habit to the divine substance or nature, as in the second principles of our person, namely in Christ, it gained this. How therefore do you, O deceiver and plunderer of sacred Scriptures, and who present nothing to those men valued with certain obols<sup><a href="#fn302" id="fn302-ref">302</a></sup>, playing in the street with fallacious dice and artifices or a certain sleight of hand deceiving the eyes of spectators, confound all things, and have mixed the cup of fallacious commixture to give as drink to the unlearned and your similars, ignorant, as I may say with prophetic speech, of fatal overturning? The singular union of God the Word with one flesh endowed with soul and mind, which He united to Himself hypostatically, you bring forth as the same with that habitual and common union, by which we all and that which is common, the substance of men, through the incarnation of the Word are conjoined with the divine substance and thus, as it is written, are made partakers of the divine nature. For you wrote, mixing both, in this mode: THE GRAMMARIAN: "Therefore in one person of the Trinity, which is God the Word, He places the salvation of all men through union. Therefore in two natures or substances, God the Word inhumanate is acknowledged: for in Him is the substance of divinity; but in Him is also the substance of humanity."<sup><a href="#fn303" id="fn303-ref">303</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But this one person from the Trinity, God the Word, is a hypostasis, but not, as you said, substance according to common signification; and the hypostasis of the Word itself, which has the substance of divinity, as you say, is one, from three hypostases, which are found in the substance of divinity and similarly and without defect fully participate the substance itself. Nor because the hypostasis participates substance, is it therefore the substance itself. Consequently God the Word inhumanate is not acknowledged in two substances as deity. For when He was one hypostasis, He united to Himself one flesh animated by rational soul by concretion, which is according to natural union, and through this natural union the substance of all men, and the whole genus, gained participation and habitual union with the divine substance and nature, which we would not have gained if God the Word had not united to Himself hypostatically human nature, that is, one flesh having intellectual soul, by no means the whole human genus. To that also looks that place, which you unlearnedly appended, which is found in the work to the most religious queens, and from which you think to confirm your erroneous opinion. But thus it is held by CYRIL: "He co-resurrected us with God and the Father in Christ, and made us sit together with Him in the heavens, as it is written<sup><a href="#fn304" id="fn304-ref">304</a></sup>. But by no means are we made gods in these, unless He who was rich as God put on our poor nature."<sup><a href="#fn305" id="fn305-ref">305</a></sup> But what is that: "He put on our poor nature," He Himself will narrate with His own proper words. For already before we appended him, in the fourth tome of his against the blasphemies of Nestorius, writing these things concerning God the Word: CYRIL: "But when once He was made in ours and communicated to one flesh according to hypostasis, in which also He is believed to have died and risen again for us—for voluntarily He suffered in the flesh."<sup><a href="#fn306" id="fn306-ref">306</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Do not, O cunning familiar, change the singular union of God the Word with the human body endowed with soul and mind into our common union, and the natural into habitual and hypostasis into the union of substances. For the hypostasis itself of God the Word is united with one flesh rationally animated, and indeed naturally; but the genus itself and the whole substance of men, with the divine substance and nature according to habit and as if through participation and grace is united, on account of the expansion with the Word, who is immutably incarnate to flesh consubstantial with us.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For behold, as it is written in the book of Jeremiah, "because of the multitude of your iniquity your hinder parts are uncovered; that your heels may suffer reproaches."<sup><a href="#fn307" id="fn307-ref">307</a></sup> Following the paths of your erroneous words, we have also scrutinized the footsteps of the malice of your heels. We have found you lurking deceitfully in diverse unions, and indeed the union according to hypostasis as if under the guise of piety and in appearance boasting, but departing to the union of habit, and indeed dividing by duality of natures after the union our one Lord and God Jesus Christ, but hiding those natures under the name of substances as if with a skin: and that, not to deceive men but, to say more truly, to use deceit against God, who through the prophet Malachi was refuting by questioning those who machinated things similar to yours, saying: "If a man deceive God, as you deceive me?"<sup><a href="#fn308" id="fn308-ref">308</a></sup>, according to which sentence also the most wise Paul said: "Do not err; God is not mocked"<sup><a href="#fn309" id="fn309-ref">309</a></sup>, who also uncovered and illuminated the heels with reproaches, that is, made manifest and clear.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>The diverse interpretation of impudence, which wants the natural hypostatic union to be the union of substances according to common signification, is overturned with many arguments.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But again behold—for again we will investigate and dilate the consideration of those things which have been effused by you—how, with the impious Theodoret saying, in the confutation of the third anathematism; THEODORET: "How therefore does he elicit that it is not fitting to divide the hypostases or natures? and knowing that, that the hypostasis of God the Word was indeed perfect before the ages, but also the form of a servant, which was assumed by it, is perfect. Therefore he said hypostases, but not hypostasis"<sup><a href="#fn310" id="fn310-ref">310</a></sup>, holy Cyril says that the hypostases, which were audaciously divided by him, are made into natural union, that one Christ from each may be acknowledged, but by no means does Cyril say two hypostases separated and subsisting in their own subsistence and to which singularly a person is ascribed to each. But he in the defense of his third anathematism says: CYRIL: "What therefore does he object to us as if an invincible and impregnable wall, and treat such weak problems, and hearing that natural union has been made, that is, true and completely unconfused and without conversion concurrence of hypostasis, he attempts to overturn the force of the words, that it may be deemed not to have been rightly done?"<sup><a href="#fn311" id="fn311-ref">311</a></sup> AND AGAIN, AFTER A FEW THINGS: "Therefore, although we understand the hypostases to be united and the Word to be inhumanated and incarnate, and thus natural union may seem to be said by us, which expels that false and habitual union, which we have through faith and sanctification, because we have also been made partakers of the divine nature and, as Paul said, 'he who adheres to the Lord is one spirit'<sup><a href="#fn312" id="fn312-ref">312</a></sup>, yet it does not subject to necessities and natural imperils the impassible and free God the Word."<sup><a href="#fn313" id="fn313-ref">313</a></sup> Writing, however, against the reprehension of the abominable Andrew, the defense of the third anathematism, he says these things: CYRIL: "Although the body is diverse according to its nature from the Word, which is from God the Father, nevertheless one is Christ and Son and God and Lord, although He was made flesh. And he does not lack the way to dissolve the mode of true inhumanation by separating two hypostases indeed receding from each other to this that they may be proper and apart, but having only external adhesion and as in order of dignity. But if we say natural union, we say true union, since Scripture inspired has this custom, that it uses this word. For somewhere the divine Paul writes to some: 'And we were by nature children of wrath, as also the rest.'<sup><a href="#fn314" id="fn314-ref">314</a></sup>" Again, in the defense of the sixth anathematism: CYRIL: "Therefore, as much as from the things already written, we will not appear ignorant of the dispensation fitting to each word, but rather not permitting soulless and spiritless things to mean to say two Sons while they divide the hypostases after the inseparable union." And he says FEW THINGS: "For we do not dogmatize a division of hypostases after the union."<sup><a href="#fn315" id="fn315-ref">315</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Not only in the defenses of the anathematisms, which he constructed against the impious detractors Andrew and Theodoret, but also in the explanations of those anathematisms he proceeds with the same words. Therefore he wrote in the explanation of the third anathematism in this way: CYRIL: "Pursuing the mystery of the Only-begotten's dispensation with flesh, we say the Word from God the Father is wondrously and ineffably united to the holy body having a rational soul; but we understand the Son to be one, just as concerning us also it is permitted to see diverse nature also soul and body to be, but nevertheless both composed into one animal. Indeed, not so are matters held by some. For dividing man singularly and properly, they say he adhered to the Word begotten from God the Father according to dignity only or authority, but not by natural, that is, true union, as we believe. For thus also divine Scripture says somewhere: 'And we were by nature children of wrath, as also the rest'<sup><a href="#fn316" id="fn316-ref">316</a></sup>, taking that 'by nature' for 'truly.' Therefore, those who divide the hypostases after the union, and place each of them separately, that is, the man and God, and fabricate adhesion according to dignity only, that is of honor or authority, the above-placed anathematism renders them alien from those accustomed to think rightly."<sup><a href="#fn317" id="fn317-ref">317</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore we see before our eyes, as if standing before our eyes, the most clear warrior, I say holy Cyril armed with the words of the Holy Spirit, at one time indeed condemning and cutting out the blasphemous tongue of Nestorius, at another receiving and blunting with strong defense the weak darts of those who censured the anathematisms, and thus striking them again with a heavy blow; at another explaining and narrating those very anathematisms to the sons of the holy Church; at another illuminating the contemplations of the Scriptures in the Scholia; and everywhere demanding from the impious, while they divide those hypostases, presenting them as two persons and two sons and two christs, to confess the union which is according to nature, so that from both they absolve one Christ and one hypostasis and nature of the Word incarnate, just as it is permitted to see man similar to us composed from two, from soul and body.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Why therefore, O excellent Grammarian, have you neglected this perfect and extensive instruction, and in the very words and sentences, those things which proceed from your heart, you dangerously fashion for us, and attempt to interpret the very clear words of the Doctor through other divinations, when you do not even tremble at that curse written through the prophet Ezekiel, which is thus uttered: 'Thus says the Lord: Woe to those who prophesy from their own heart, and see nothing!'<sup><a href="#fn318" id="fn318-ref">318</a></sup>? For you say this assertion: 'Christ is from two natures' or hypostases, namely from the hypostasis of God the Word and from the hypostasis of one flesh animated by rational soul, is not to be understood thus, but rather it is to be confessed that He is in two substances, while you affirm that the hypostatic union of substances has been made, because holy Cyril used the word 'hypostases' for substances, and indeed for substances according to common signification: which common signification knows substance to be comprehensive of many hypostases, just as the substance of divinity indeed signifies at the same time the three hypostases of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and again the substance of humanity comprehends each one of men. From which you will gather with blasphemy that this must be thought, which is often divine, namely that the holy Trinity is incarnate to the whole humanity and composed with our whole genus: for composition is incarnation, and hypostatic union and natural union, according to which also the soul of man similar to us is composed and united with its proper body. Or again: it remains that from the same madness you are led to the habitual union according to which we all, men, have been made partakers of the divine nature through the incomprehensible and inexplicable incarnation of God the Word. But to call a hypostasis, because it participates substance, for example, because Peter participates the substance of humanity, 'substance according to common signification', is of extreme impiety and of a very unlearned mind. For neither is Peter, that one hypostasis, because he participates humanity, thought to be the substance of the whole humanity, which comprehends all hypostases of all men. Nor again shall we think God the Word, because He participates the same substance with the Father and the Spirit, to be the very substance of divinity, comprehensive of three hypostases.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But this, which the discourse itself in its extended consideration has demonstrated, we repeat many times, so that those things which have been written by us may become more evident to those who encounter them, and likewise through reprehensions the darkness of your impiety may be made manifest, teaching us that the hypostatic union is of two substances according to common signification, according to which similarly the one Christ must be defined in two natures, that is, substances. Therefore, I have already cited holy Athanasius above, where as if in a certain prior contemplation I showed, before I dissolved your impious assertions with refutations, signifying what substance and hypostasis and nature and person are, writing to the bishops established in Africa<sup><a href="#fn319" id="fn319-ref">319</a></sup>, that by substance and also hypostasis is signified that which is and subsists, and that which exists, and thence calling both substance and hypostasis by the name of 'existent', while he instilled fear from the divine Scriptures<sup><a href="#fn320" id="fn320-ref">320</a></sup> into the wicked Arians, who scorned these names as handed down with no testimony and used very little in the Scriptures. But it is pleasing to append again the demonstration of that Doctor himself on this matter, which is as follows. ATHANASIUS: "From which it is permitted to observe, brothers, that those who were at Nicaea breathe the words of the Scriptures. For God says, in Exodus indeed: 'I am He who is'<sup><a href="#fn321" id="fn321-ref">321</a></sup>, through Jeremiah however: 'Who has stood in His subsistence and seen His word?'<sup><a href="#fn322" id="fn322-ref">322</a></sup>, and a little later: 'If you have stood in My hypostasis, and have heard My words'<sup><a href="#fn323" id="fn323-ref">323</a></sup>. But hypostasis is substance, nor does it have another signification, except this very thing, that which is: which Jeremiah calls existence, saying: 'Nor did they hear the voice of His existence'<sup><a href="#fn324" id="fn324-ref">324</a></sup>. For hypostasis and substance is existence; for it is and exists. This also when Paul understood, he wrote to the Hebrews: 'Who is the brightness of glory and the figure of His hypostasis'<sup><a href="#fn325" id="fn325-ref">325</a></sup>. But those who think they know the Scriptures and call themselves wise, because they do not wish to speak of hypostasis concerning God—for this they wrote at Ariminum and in their other synods—they are not such as are about to depart, saying also in their heart, like the fool: 'There is no God'<sup><a href="#fn326" id="fn326-ref">326</a></sup>?"<sup><a href="#fn327" id="fn327-ref">327</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">From these things the mind of this wise mystagogue evidently appears. For he teaches that substance and hypostasis are also existence. For that which is, and that which subsists, no one thinks to be other than that which exists, and that this is held with no difference between those names. Therefore, when substance has this difference, if compared with hypostasis, as the God-bearing Basil teaches, which that which is common has if compared with the individual, and that holds the place of genus and comprehends many hypostases, but does not define the demonstration and signification of one only in such a species of existence, as the wise in divine things Cyril teaches in the work composed through question and answer on the holy Trinity<sup><a href="#fn328" id="fn328-ref">328</a></sup>; and when no other difference of substance and hypostasis beyond that alone has been handed down to us by the holy Fathers; how, you say, O Grammarian—for I will now also interrogate you—did holy Cyril think and say the union of hypostases for the natural conjunction of substances? Moreover, it is superfluous for me to inquire from you: for you have declared through the whole codex of that lamentable little book, that you confess Christ to be 'two natures united' and 'in two natures united'<sup><a href="#fn329" id="fn329-ref">329</a></sup>, and that you understand 'natures' as if substances according to common signification. When therefore this common signification exhibits to us substance as comprehensive of many and homogeneous hypostases, through your impious loquacity you insinuate to us that insane thing from which you show yourself to flee, namely that the substance of divinity, as you say, that is the holy Trinity, is incarnate to the whole substance of humanity and genus; or for the natural and hypostatic union of Emmanuel you establish that habitual adhesion, according to which we all men have been made partakers of the divine nature, and have gained participation and indwelling of divine grace, so that through this your confused garrulity the indwelling itself may also be thought to be incarnation, according to that which was said in the Gospel by the Lord: 'If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our abode with him'<sup><a href="#fn330" id="fn330-ref">330</a></sup>. For saying the union of substances has been made, you wrote that the whole substance of divinity is in Christ, and the whole substance of humanity is in Him, as above, when we appended your tomes with words, we examined<sup><a href="#fn331" id="fn331-ref">331</a></sup>; where we also said that God the Word partook perfectly and without defect of the substance of humanity and of the genus of substance: for not therefore is He thought to have hypostatically united to Himself the whole substance of humanity; and similarly, since He is perfect according to divinity, just as the Father and the Holy Spirit, not on account of the fact that He participates substance with them perfectly and fully and without defect, is He Himself thought to be, as you supposed and even wrote, the whole substance of divinity comprehensive of three hypostases: for this sentence is of those who confuse the hypostases and, like you, know not what they say, and again corrupt the reason of the inhumanation.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For that which is said without determination: 'the whole or integral substance, or nature of divinity', comprehends three hypostases, the wise Cyril signified, who, in the eighty-eighth homily on the Gospel of Luke, wrote thus: CYRIL: "But He says Spirit in these things, not only that Holy One, but the whole nature of divinity, as is perceived in the Father and in the Son and in the Holy Spirit. Moreover, the Savior also said in a certain place that the Spirit is God. Therefore blasphemy against the Spirit is done against the whole supreme substance: for one is, as I said, the nature of divinity, which is understood in the holy and adorable Trinity. Therefore, as the Parotinians say, 'let us put a door to our tongue and a bar'<sup><a href="#fn332" id="fn332-ref">332</a></sup>, asking from the supreme God and saying: 'Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, and a door of enclosure about my lips; incline not my heart to evil words'<sup><a href="#fn333" id="fn333-ref">333</a></sup>. For words of evil are those which are uttered against God."<sup><a href="#fn334" id="fn334-ref">334</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore you are discovered corrupting the inexplicable incarnation and inhumanation of the Word even in those things which you said: THE GRAMMARIAN: "Therefore in one person of the holy Trinity, which is the person of God the Word, He places the salvation of all men through union. Consequently, in two natures, or in two substances, God the Word incarnate is acknowledged: for He has the substance of divinity; but He also has again the substance of humanity."<sup><a href="#fn335" id="fn335-ref">335</a></sup> For not because the Word united to Himself flesh endowed with soul and mind by natural union, and thus became the first-fruits of our second genus, and called that to newness of life, that He might destroy death, which had entered through sin from the first first-fruits, that is, from Adam, and because all men who have believed in Him have received benefit from that redemption, which was effected by a dispensation worthy of God, therefore is understood, as you say, the whole humanity and the whole substance and the whole genus to be hypostatically united to the Word Himself, and in this manner to be in Him, as you dared to say. Nor again because the Word is consubstantial with the Father and the Holy Spirit, is He Himself thought to be the whole substance of divinity, as you raved. And thus quietly and without noise, as someone might say, and by stealing simple hearing, you gather the absurd, saying: "For in Him is had the substance of divinity; but in Him is also had the substance of humanity", so that from this the holy Trinity and the substance of divinity might be thought to be hypostatically united to the whole substance of humanity and genus. For if one person is God the Word, how is He the whole divinity, comprehensive of three persons of the Father and the Word Himself and the Son and the Holy Spirit? And if one flesh rationally animated is united to the Word by the conjunction of natural union, how again will the whole substance of humanity itself be foolishly thought to be that? But I seem to be led around with the little cord which you wove from sand, as is said<sup><a href="#fn336" id="fn336-ref">336</a></sup>, and while I unravel its weaving, I am turned in the same circle and unwillingly speak the same things.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That also Nestorius, intoxicated with the same impiety, came into that speech so as to say the Trinity itself was incarnate, and accused the orthodox of division of the divine substance.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But it is proper to those who dissect the one Christ with a duality of natures, and choose a feigned habitual union before the true and natural union, that they have become diverse and through manifold error have turned the divine incarnation of God the Word into this, that the Trinity itself might be thought incarnate and inhumanate, as Nestorius proceeding into the midst testifies, who in that error became, as he thought, the leader of diverse and also dangerous paths. For indeed in the memoranda of the Ephesine acts concerning him, the venerable Acacius, bishop of Melitene, after other things, wrote these things: ACACIUS OF MELITENE: "And at first indeed he used to impose necessity by his absurd interrogation on those responding, either of utterly denying the divinity of the Only-begotten to be inhumanate, or of confessing—which would have been impious—that the divinity of the Father and also of the Holy Spirit is incarnate with the Word; which is altogether of a polluted opinion and expels orthodox faith. But afterwards, when the question was again agitated, with a certain bishop, who was with him, speaking and asserting that another is the Son who underwent the Passion, but another God the Word, not being able to bear that blasphemy, I went out."<sup><a href="#fn337" id="fn337-ref">337</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Expanding this voice of the most God-loving Acacius, which reveals that insanity, which impiously through implication of error induces that the holy Trinity is incarnate, when Nestorius wished to overturn it, in those memoranda composed by himself, narrating as if in a theatre and singly and in a corner<sup><a href="#fn338" id="fn338-ref">338</a></sup>, composing those things with false writings<sup><a href="#fn339" id="fn339-ref">339</a></sup> as if written at Ephesus, again accused Acacius, because he did not accept his foolish question, of division of unity in the holy Trinity of divinity, writing these things: NESTORIUS: "When he was pressed with this inexpedient confutation, he used to define the Son to be a certain part of the one divinity, and that to be loosed with the temple. But when all trembled at that blasphemy, he immediately descended into the midst and fled. This our interrogation Acacius now calls insanity."<sup><a href="#fn340" id="fn340-ref">340</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">When therefore Nestorius said these things, let us consider whether the Grammarian does not proceed through words akin to these, since he is driven by the fury of that adversary's spirit and accuses us of division of unity in the Trinity of divinity. But we do not agree, as he says, to confess the hypostatic union of the whole substance of divinity and of the whole substance of humanity. For he himself also wrote these things in the lamentable little book—which if anyone should call a book of removal (as it were, according to divine Scripture<sup><a href="#fn341" id="fn341-ref">341</a></sup>), he will not at all recede from that which is fitting: for it separates and removes from God those who are caught in his snares: THE GRAMMARIAN: "These are the objections of the adversaries. For they think the substance of divinity to be subject to division and that a part indeed appears in the Father, but another part in the Son, another part in the Holy Spirit, so that each of the hypostases is conceived in a part, not however in all those things which are proper to divinity. But we have not run to such impiety, as to think there is division or section in the divine substance."<sup><a href="#fn342" id="fn342-ref">342</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, the concordance indeed of the heretical accusations which have been brought forth, and of the sentences and words, appears to all; but those already considered we have refuted, where we also showed manifestly that 'not to divide nor cut the unity and identity of the divine substance' is, namely, to think and say three hypostases distinct by properties alone, in no way diverse in all things, in divinity, in goodness, in eternity, in royal dignity, in glory, in virtue, and in other things in which it is understood to be fitting for God to be, but not to pour out and confound the hypostases among themselves.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">These things therefore have now been investigated and added, with the deceitful and unclean words of Nestorius brought into the midst, for no other cause except that you may know, O Grammarian, from what seeds the offshoots of your wisdom have sprung forth. Therefore run indeed on that diverse path which you have laid for yourself, saying indeed that you confess hypostatic union, but after the union confessing a duality of natures, calling them substances, and secretly you introduce the habitual conjunction, which all men have acquired through the inhumanation of the Word made partakers of the divine nature.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That when the Doctors call the hypostasis of God the Word and the flesh from Mary, which He naturally united to Himself, 'substances' and 'natures' and 'hypostases', they do not mean generic substances according to common signification, but those things from which the one Christ is understood to be.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But we know the Son and Word anterior to the ages, incorporeal and impassible and eternal, as Word, begotten from the Father, to be one hypostasis; and if we find Him called 'substance' by the God-bearing Fathers, mystagogues of the holy Church, we acknowledge that he used the name of substance for 'hypostasis'. Nor because the name of substance is properly significative of generic signification and comprehensive of many hypostases, do we therefore bring the hypostasis of the Only-begotten to generic signification and think it not to be one hypostasis, but substance comprehensive of three hypostases, because eventually it was called 'substance': for, according to the subject and the usurpation and composition of names, it is fair to understand.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Thus above<sup><a href="#fn343" id="fn343-ref">343</a></sup> I cited holy Basil, in the first oration, a passage which he wrote against the impious Eunomius, calling the one hypostasis of the Son 'substance', with these words: BASIL: "But since He is one according to subject, and one and simple and in no way composite substance, accommodating appellations diverse among themselves to cognitions."<sup><a href="#fn344" id="fn344-ref">344</a></sup> In the second oration, however, that Doctor likewise wrote: BASIL: "But substance is life and operative, and is the splendor of the glory of God: wherefore also He shows the whole Father in Himself, resplendent from His whole glory."<sup><a href="#fn345" id="fn345-ref">345</a></sup> But the wise John, who flourished on the seat of the priesthood of Constantinople in orthodoxy, explaining the Gospel of John, in the fourth oration, said these things: JOHN: "But this Word is a certain hypostatic substance, which proceeded from the Father Himself without passion. For that, as I said, He signifies through the appellation of the Word."<sup><a href="#fn346" id="fn346-ref">346</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Similarly also, even if we hear that one flesh animated by rational soul, which is united to God the Word by the conjunction of natural union, called by the doctors by the name of 'substance', we will not on that account induce the name of substance, which is properly comprehensive of many hypostases, to indicate generic signification, and we will not think that one flesh, composed with the Word, which is unconfusedly and inseparably united to it, to be one according to hypostasis, but comprehensive of many fleshes animated by rational souls. For one flesh endowed with soul and mind, even if it is called 'substance' for 'hypostasis', does not cease to be a hypostasis, nor on that account is it thought to hold the place of the whole genus according to common signification and to be comprehensive of many hypostases. Thus you will find Cyril himself, the eminent mystagogue of divine things, who elicits that the union has been made from the hypostases of God the Word and of one flesh animated by rational soul, calling the humanity of Christ 'substance'. For indeed, in the second epistle to Succensus, these things, which also among the things previously considered by us have been appended<sup><a href="#fn347" id="fn347-ref">347</a></sup>, he wrote: CYRIL: "For if, after we had said 'the nature of the Word', we had been silent, not having added 'incarnate', as if excluding the dispensation, perhaps there would have been speech for them, and indeed not inept, and at the same time it would have to be asked: Where is the perfection of humanity, or how does the substance similar to us subsist? But because both perfection in humanity and designation of our substance is introduced through this, that 'incarnate' is said, they cease to lean on a broken staff."<sup><a href="#fn348" id="fn348-ref">348</a></sup> But the holy John, bishop of Constantinople, in the eleventh oration of the commentary on the Gospel of John, calls those hypostases, from which the one Christ is, 'substances', thus writing: JOHN: "Therefore when you hear: 'The Word was made flesh', be not troubled nor disturbed. For neither did substance fall into flesh—for this would be of perfect impiety—but remaining what it was, thus it took the form of a servant."<sup><a href="#fn349" id="fn349-ref">349</a></sup> Behold immediately he called the hypostasis of the Word 'substance'; for that is what was also incarnate, that is, it did not indeed fall into flesh, but remaining what it was, it took the form of a servant—for to think or say that pertains to those who are foolish with impiety beyond telling. And after other things again in the same oration he said: JOHN: "For what does He also add: 'And dwelt among us'? As if He said: Suspect nothing absurd from this saying: 'He was made'. For I did not speak of a change of that immutable nature, but of a sojourn in a tabernacle and an indwelling. But He who sojourns in a tabernacle is not the same as that tabernacle in which He sojourns: for one sojourns in another as in a tabernacle; but if not, there is not a sojourn in a tabernacle, for no one sojourns in himself as in a tabernacle. But I said another according to substance; for by union and adherence God the Word and the flesh are one, no confusion or removal of the substances having been made, but by an inexplicable and true union, which He alone knows."<sup><a href="#fn350" id="fn350-ref">350</a></sup> Therefore you see, as it were, how he proclaimed the ineffable union of God the Word and the flesh, which are one in union, no confusion of the 'substances' having been made: consequently the very hypostasis of the Word—for this is incarnate—is manifestly and without any controversy called 'substance', and that one flesh, born from the God-bearing Mary, endowed with soul and mind—for to it, and to it alone the Word is incarnate, and united it ineffably to Himself—is without any controversy clearly named 'substance'.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">When therefore the one hypostasis of God the Word and one flesh, evidently animated by rational soul, which is united to Him by the conjunction of natural union, have been called by these eminent and excellent doctors nature and hypostasis and substance without any controversy and clearly, we and all sons of orthodoxy say that Christ Himself is both from two natures, and from two hypostases, and from two substances, acknowledging absolutely no difference between these names. For from which the natural and true and ineffable union is held, from those indeed Emmanuel, who is compacted from the union, is one from two, one Lord, one Son, one Christ, one person, one hypostasis, one nature of God the Word incarnate and perfectly inhumanate, but not two natures, nor two hypostases, nor two substances, nor two persons, because neither are there two Lords, nor two sons, nor two christs, on account of the fact that those substances or hypostases or natures do not subsist in their own subsistence and separately and singly, but are acknowledged without defect and without confusion in composition, and one from both is absolved nature and hypostasis of the Word incarnate, so that they are indeed separated in contemplation alone of those things from which the one Christ is and their difference appears, but after the thought of the union the separation of duality vanishes, as we have fully exposited in the things said before.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">If anyone, however, understands substances according to common signification and generic notion, according to which substance is comprehensive of many hypostases, as the substance of divinity is comprehensive of three hypostases of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and the substance of humanity is comprehensive of all hypostases of men, and from these substances says the one Christ is composed: that one will receive the condemnation of insanity and extreme impiety. Moreover, you incur, O Grammarian, the reprehension of that ridiculous opinion<sup><a href="#fn351" id="fn351-ref">351</a></sup>, which according to your unlearned impiety rolls down and most evilly thinks the holy Trinity to be incarnate to the whole human genus and to the whole human substance according to generic notion and common signification. For from one hypostasis of God the Word and again from one flesh, born from the God-bearing Mary, animated by rational soul, hypostatic union has been made, from which again Emmanuel is understood and said to be. Nor because the hypostasis of the Word is in the substance and in the common signification of divinity, which it participates fully and perfectly and without defect with the Father and the Spirit and according to which it is consubstantial with them, therefore also the hypostases which with the very hypostasis of the Son participate the substance and kinship<sup><a href="#fn352" id="fn352-ref">352</a></sup> of divinity, I mean the hypostases of the Father and of the Holy Spirit, become with it clothed with flesh<sup><a href="#fn353" id="fn353-ref">353</a></sup>, so that they also are thought to be incarnate. Nor again because the flesh born from Mary, endowed with soul and mind, which is hypostatically united to the Word, is in the substance and generic signification of humanity, and also participates that fully and without defect with those fleshes with which it is consubstantial, therefore we also have that we are hypostatically united with the Word Himself, because by kinship of humanity and of the common substance's definition we are conjoined with the very flesh of Christ.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For those substances according to generic signification—I mean: divinity, that is, the holy Trinity, and humanity, that is, the whole human genus—are absolutely distant and separated, and in no way composed among themselves; but Christ is not composed from generic substances, but from the one hypostasis of God the Word and from one flesh, born from the God-bearing Virgin, rationally animated, and is one from two: as God the Word, He is homogeneous with the Father and the Spirit, that is, He participates the same substance with them, and is consubstantial; as incarnate, however, He is homogeneous with us, that is, He participated and is the same consubstantial with us the same substance with men. Nor because the generic substances, divinity and humanity, are absolutely distant from each other and far apart by definitions of nature, therefore He Himself Christ also is divided with those substances, from which He is not composed: for not the generic substance of divinity, comprehensive of three hypostases, with the generic substance of humanity or the whole genus of men, is composed and absolves one Christ, but the one hypostasis of the Word undertook an ineffable composition with one flesh endowed with soul and mind and is called Emmanuel.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For thus it is permitted to see also in the constitution of any man. For each one, for example Paul, is composed from one rational soul and one body, which are of diverse species among themselves and in no way consubstantial. But, not because Paul's soul, since it is one, is referred to the genus and substance of all rational souls, and again Paul's body, since it is one, is referred to the genus and substance of all human bodies, therefore do we think Paul composed from the very genera or from the very comprehensive substances; or vice versa, because the genus of all rational souls and the genus and substance of bodies are divided by definitions of nature, does Paul therefore, who is composed from one soul and one body without section, and is one nature and one hypostasis composed, at the same time divided with the generic substances? For the very composition of one man and one hypostasis, that is, of Paul, subsists from things of diverse substance, namely from soul and body; not, however, because the soul itself indeed falls under the substance and genus of rational souls, and the body is subject to the substance and genus of human bodies, therefore with them according to the diversity of the genera and substances the hypostasis is separated, on account of the fact that those things from which it subsists are referred to diverse genera and different substances, which utterly and wholly are distant from each other and, as far as is permitted to see, sensible is distant from intelligible. For thus also holy Cyril, in the second epistle to Succensus, wrote: CYRIL: "Of what sort is the thing man from soul and from body. For things of this sort are diverse according to species and in no way consubstantial among themselves; but where they are of one, they have absolved one nature of man, although in the account of composition the difference according to nature of those things which are gathered into unity stands."<sup><a href="#fn354" id="fn354-ref">354</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>Scrutiny of the disputation already held in the previous chapter against the impious and insane question, which says: If we say Christ is God and consubstantial with the Father according to divinity, and consubstantial with us according to humanity, do we say He is in two substances?</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, according to your manifest and crude and impious unlearnedness, O Grammarian, because Paul has a soul consubstantial with our souls, and likewise a body consubstantial with human and homogeneous bodies, will he be dissected into two consubstantial things, as it pleases you to say, Paul, who subsists from two, I mean from soul and body, which are diverse species and in no way consubstantial with each other? Or Emmanuel, who from the one hypostasis of God the Word and from one flesh, born from the God-bearing Mary, and rationally animated, is compacted into an inseparable and ineffable union, and from the natural conjunction of those things which differ substantially among themselves is one, consubstantial indeed with the Father and the Spirit according to divinity, and with us men, the same consubstantial according to humanity, will He suffer a similar section and be divided into two consubstantials—He the one who is from two, that one person, that one hypostasis, that one nature of God the Word incarnate? And concerning those who think rightly, do you dare to say these incredible things surpassing all stupor of mind: THE GRAMMARIAN: "But how do they establish Christ both consubstantial with the Father and consubstantial with us after the union, and do not cease to confess two indeed consubstantials, but deny two substances?"<sup><a href="#fn355" id="fn355-ref">355</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And how shall we think, O ridiculous one, that rather there are two that one Lord God Jesus Christ, according to your impiety, and not from two, from divinity consubstantial with the Father and the Spirit and from humanity consubstantial with us, men? But how does he who says that, say two consubstantials? Or do you think impiously to say two is the same as to say from two? But neither the reason of common notions, nor that of the instruction of the holy Fathers, consents to that insanity. For duality is significative of separation, the formula 'from two' is indicative of composition and unconfused union. And indeed, because Christ is from two, from divinity and from humanity, He is one nature and hypostasis of God the Word incarnate, therefore necessarily and consequently He is perceived to be the same consubstantial with the Father indeed according to divinity, but also with us according to humanity, so that the same also is the Son of God and the same is the Son of man, but not therefore two Sons, but one and the same Son. For man also similar to us is from a mortal body and from an immortal and rational soul; and the same is called mortal and the same is called rational, nor does the natural and diverse signification of soul and body divide the composition, nor does it make that one man from two into two men: for man is one hypostasis, one nature, one person, not indeed simple but hypostasis.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But excellently and as it befitted you preparing calumny, you wrote concerning us: THE GRAMMARIAN: "But how do they establish Christ both consubstantial with the Father and consubstantial with us after the union..."<sup><a href="#fn356" id="fn356-ref">356</a></sup> without adding: 'the same Christ'. And indeed in truth, if He is not the same, but one indeed consubstantial with the Father, but another consubstantial with us, united by equality of name and will, and therefore both are said and conceived to be one Christ, then also two natures and two hypostases and two substances have place. I have admiringly wondered at the power of truth, how, namely, since you also say two natures, and thus divide the one Christ, and for the sake of deception and through mere fallacy you pretend to use rectitude, and you cover the two natures with the word 'indivisible', but you hide Christ divided, in appearance saying Him 'one and the same', truth itself so many times impels you to forget the coverings of your lie and to show your impiety openly. Behold, for it forced you also to show from the treasures of your heart whence you think and say 'two substances' the one Christ to be. But you lack this, that you do not confess the same consubstantial with the Father according to divinity and the same consubstantial with us, men, according to humanity, but one indeed consubstantial with the Father, but another also consubstantial with us, two substances to be called one Christ: and this your great accusation against us cries out; THE GRAMMARIAN: "But how do they establish Christ both consubstantial with the Father and consubstantial with us after the union, and do not cease to confess two indeed consubstantials, but deny two substances?"<sup><a href="#fn357" id="fn357-ref">357</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Know therefore from those things which you wrote, and, as divine Job says<sup><a href="#fn358" id="fn358-ref">358</a></sup>, from your own hand your reprehension is had. For we therefore do not say Christ Himself two substances, because we confess Him from divinity consubstantial with the Father, from humanity consubstantial with us, men, to be one person and one hypostasis and one nature of God the Word incarnate, and the same consubstantial with the Father indeed according to divinity, but with us, men, according to humanity. But if from your confession you remove that which you say 'the same', as the enunciation of your accusation wishes, consequently you beget the offspring of such separation, two substances and two natures and two hypostases and two persons, and now also follow two christs and two sons; and to the natures indeed and substances mutually of indivisible and united natures and substances a person is persuasively imposed, but the two persons themselves and two sons put on one and the same Christ. For he who does not say Emmanuel to be from two, nor denies duality after the union, that one does not know the one and the same Christ Jesus to be God and man, that indeed existing eternally, but this for us immutably and truly, remaining what it was, made in the last times. Which has also been clearly shown by the words of holy Cyril, in those things which have been considered and brought into the midst, which shout with every trumpet more clearly, at one time indeed these: CYRIL: "But, after the union, as if the division into two has now been removed, we believe there is one nature of the Son, as of one, but inhumanated and incarnate"<sup><a href="#fn359" id="fn359-ref">359</a></sup>, at another time again, through the example of common man similar to us: "so that those two natures are not now two, but from both one animal is absolved."<sup><a href="#fn360" id="fn360-ref">360</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And so we do not deny those things from which the one and only Christ is, but to say them two after the union we do not tolerate, since from the voice of holy Cyril and of the theological men similar to him we have learned that destructive of duality is hypostatic union, just as vice versa duality is the section of union. Therefore we confess Christ from two natures, but we do not say Him to be two natures; and we say Him from two substances, that is, from two hypostases: of God the Word and of one flesh animated by rational soul, which are also held by the conjunction of natural union; but we do not say Him to be two substances, just as neither two hypostases, nor two persons. If anyone, however, understands substances according to common signification, which are comprehensive of many hypostases and hold the place of genus, such stupidity, and impiety, I say, we cast back to you, O Grammarian, because this pleases you and, as Isaiah the prophet says: 'this is your portion and this is your lot'<sup><a href="#fn361" id="fn361-ref">361</a></sup>. For Christ is not composed from generic substances, so that the Trinity is found incarnate to the whole human genus. Which we will not cease to say many times, 'if perhaps you may hear, if perhaps you may perceive'<sup><a href="#fn362" id="fn362-ref">362</a></sup>: for I also take that word from the prophet Ezekiel, while I pacify the sophistic and contentious disposition of your impiety.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER THIRTY</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That it is ridiculous what these impious ones say, namely that they say Christ is in two natures, lest they be caught saying, as Nestorius, that Christ is in two hypostases: for he himself Nestorius also used to say that Christ subsists both in two substances and in two natures.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">You who indeed think that, because you busy yourself in the turnings of names, you stand outside the madness of Nestorius, you also call impious the father of your impieties and the preceptor of this varied adulteration, and you will say, as if you have found a certain wise sentence, that you call the flesh animated by rational soul, which is united to God the Word, substance, and in no way hypostasis, because hypostasis is designative of person, but to Nestorius pertains that which is said to be person united to the Word, having fabricated these things in vain and mendaciously against your own head. Behold, for Nestorius himself calls the flesh animated by rational soul and united to the Word substance, in the writing which is entitled: "Against the Theopaschites", thus: NESTORIUS: "With words 'Christ' or 'Only-begotten' or 'Jesus' or 'Son', and of this sort, we prefix the name of union; but with the word 'man', the substance which was assumed; with the word 'God the Word', however, the property of the hypostasis which was inhumanate, and to say in few words, the words are of multiple signification, which proclaim our Lord Christ to the world."<sup><a href="#fn363" id="fn363-ref">363</a></sup> And after other things: "But He hid that which is proper in each nature. And from every dignity which befits divinity and the body of divinity, He showed Himself existing in Himself. He was made humble in each: to divinity indeed, which is above figure, He imposed a formed figure<sup><a href="#fn364" id="fn364-ref">364</a></sup>, the substance of members in flesh conceived without seed, and experienced of sin and of equal dignity with divine power, He bore mortality for all."<sup><a href="#fn365" id="fn365-ref">365</a></sup> Again, in the oration which is inscribed: "Exposition of Faith"<sup><a href="#fn366" id="fn366-ref">366</a></sup>, whose beginning is: "We confess the dogma: consubstantial"<sup><a href="#fn367" id="fn367-ref">367</a></sup>, in the fifteenth chapter, he says these things: NESTORIUS: "Therefore, in two natures we await one Son and judge of all of us, visible and likewise invisible; but visible insofar as He accepted our visible substance and deigned to make it inseparable from Himself, invisible however according to the divine substance, according to which 'no man has seen, nor can see'<sup><a href="#fn368" id="fn368-ref">368</a></sup>, as the divine Apostle said."<sup><a href="#fn369" id="fn369-ref">369</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">When you have heard these things, will you think that you have found something new, you who have changed the formula 'in two natures' into the formula 'in two substances'? For manifestly you see Nestorius said the one Son in two natures, as the Chalcedonian synod said, and, as you yourself have done, applied the name of nature to the appellation of 'substances'. But that those natures in which you say Christ is, are also called hypostases by the Judaic troop of those who think the same as Nestorius, can easily be learned, many being passed over on account of their abundance, from a few clear words. For the impious Theodoret wrote, in the censure of the third from the chapters or anathematisms of holy Cyril, these things: THEODORET: "To confess one person and one Son and Christ similarly is pious; but to say two hypostases or natures united is not absurd, but consonant with the cause."<sup><a href="#fn370" id="fn370-ref">370</a></sup> And he who said two natures are two hypostases, and pretended to confess one person, towards the end of the censure changed the venerable natures and hypostases into two persons, saying: "How does he ascribe impiety to those who divide the properties of the natures, namely of God, who is before the ages, and of the man assumed in the last days, he who teaches us mixture through other names?"<sup><a href="#fn371" id="fn371-ref">371</a></sup> Therefore, who even among those who have a blunted acuteness of mind does not clearly understand: they are refuted for saying that the same are natures and substances and hypostases and persons? For this one person, this one Son and Christ, whom it is pious to confess, he says, in God, who is before the ages, and in the man assumed at the end of the ages, posited in two natures and two hypostases, is dissolved; and what is the bond of each?</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">And the cause of this assertion is considered indeed cautious, but it is also foolish; and it is easy to refute; and it reveals that serious accusation of mixture. For he who said such absurd things with such impiety, the excellent Theodoret, says concerning holy Cyril: "he who teaches us mixture through other names."<sup><a href="#fn372" id="fn372-ref">372</a></sup> But, in the defense of the anathematism itself, wisely expanding the revelation of Theodoret's impiety, Cyril shows that to thus divide the united is to divide into two sons: one Christ, writing thus: CYRIL: "Nor again does the reason of rectitude permit dividing one Christ and Son and Lord into two sons, holy and inspired Scripture instructing us for this. But it holds a very small account of the truth of dogmas, and of those things which are necessary for utility, just as it greatly disdains the series of those things which are born for harm; but it glories, as it seems, in falsehood; and most skillfully arranging the knowledge of calumny, let him hear from us: 'Why do you glory in malice, O mighty one? Iniquity all the day long; your tongue has devised injustice!'"<sup><a href="#fn373" id="fn373-ref">373</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Know therefore, O Grammarian, while you entangle your feet in the snares of Nestorius, that duality after the union, even if you wish to call it by the name of nature or of substances, will result in two hypostases and persons. For this is proper to hypostatic union, that as in subtle contemplations and in thought and only perceiving with the eyes of the soul, as holy Cyril says, it considers those things from which Christ is, and sees without confusion and diminishment the concurrence of two natures, or substances, or hypostases, and apprehends the lack of division of the union, according to which we understand them to subsist in composition, but not in their own subsistence, and after the thought of the union we no longer conceive division into two, so that those things which appear as two in mere intellectual phantasies, are now indeed not two, but from both we see one hypostasis and nature of the Word incarnate absolved. For these teachings are manifestly in the very words of wise Cyril, indeed the opinion of the apostolic Church; just as we have appended in many places in the things already considered.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That vainly from ignorance these impious ones mock the opinion, by which we confess one nature of God the Word incarnate after the union; as if before the union there had been two natures, but after the union one of them had been removed.</em></p>
        
        <p class="paragraph">Where therefore will you hide your face, who against the inspired voices of the mystagogues write these things full of all insanity and stupor of mind and impiety? THE GRAMMARIAN: "But perhaps the adversaries will say that before the union the difference is held, but after the union not at all. Concerning such men I rather grieve as concerning those who hold the mind of Nestorius' doctrine. For indeed this Nestorius also says that first the man was made and then God the Word dwelt in him: which both the modern calumniators and the followers of Nestorius affirm. But perhaps changing the word they will say: 'In the union we say two, but after the union one;'. Behold, I who am alert, will interrogate: 'Do you think something different or the same is signified by the words "after the union" and the words "in the union"? If they say something different is signified, let them state the mode of the difference. Is it not as if the union had now been removed and dissolved, according to the impious doctrine of those who deprave the Scriptures and say that God the Word laid aside the flesh from Himself after the ascension into heaven? For thus in truth according to the madmen, one nature which was before in the union being rejected after the union, it comes about that one nature remains after the union. Or indeed they will fear this opinion, fearing lest they be refuted as those who strip God the Word of flesh, but they will say that the union indeed remains stable, but that one nature is absolved?' But we to these things will say, the union remaining, two natures also absolutely remain in the union; but if not, the union is not held."<sup><a href="#fn374" id="fn374-ref">374</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Come now, tell me: you who say that you grieve concerning us, when you are drunk with incurable drunkenness and thus rave and stand in need of much grief and tears and lamentations, is this so wonderful? For such are those who are drunk not only with wine but also with that which is from various causes; insanity and drunkenness: who despairing themselves and suffering from vertigo, think those standing by, very often even not moved, are saddened. But explain to us, O vigorous one: when wise Cyril fights against Nestorius and, in the second tome against his blasphemies, elicits: "Cease to divide the natures after the union?"<sup><a href="#fn375" id="fn375-ref">375</a></sup>, will you understand that formula "after the union" according to a temporal comparison and will you say that before the union there were two natures of Christ, and divide them, and machinate against the Doctor and say to him: "Because he said: 'Cease to divide the natures after the union', you offer for understanding through comparison that before the union those natures subsisted and were divided"? And who is so insane and unlearned as you, that he would say these things?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For before the union and incarnation the Word was simple and devoid of flesh which is of composition; but when mercifully and because of the dispensation He willed immutably to become man, remaining also what He was, then He was also named Christ and Emmanuel, taking the name from the thing and having become with us. When He hypostatically assumed to Himself flesh consubstantial with us and endowed with soul and mind, which did not subsist before nor was formed, but in that very union to Him was ineffably brought into subsistence, so that of the Word incarnate Himself were the conception, formation, growth, and gradual progress, and generation, because He assumed the natural union of the nature of flesh which was conceived and formed and increased and was begotten, although He showed that flesh to be beyond the limits of nature, insofar as it was born from the Virgin without seed and from the Holy Spirit, and the virginity of the very mother was not loosed in childbirth. Therefore he who elicits that He was called "Christ Jesus" after the union, signifies the time of that very appellation as having concurrency with the generation; I mean that generation which was made through the holy Virgin. For thus also holy Cyril, in the first tome against the blasphemies of Nestorius, writes: CYRIL: "For then He was called 'Christ Jesus' the Son, when He was God the Word and wisdom and life and light. Therefore it is clear that the time of this very appellation has concurrency with the generation; that generation I say, which was made through the holy Virgin."<sup><a href="#fn376" id="fn376-ref">376</a></sup> And again in the second book he similarly elicits: "But indeed the name and thing of Christ in no way befits that Word from God the Father, when we understand It naked and according to itself and outside flesh."<sup><a href="#fn377" id="fn377-ref">377</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">How therefore is it not utterly foolish, and indeed surpassing all unlearning, to consider before the union those things from which Christ is constituted, since God the Word after the union to flesh animated by rational soul is called Christ, although the Word was before the ages? For it is the same as if someone, from the mind being extended, would imagine the Word to be incarnate before the incarnation. For the name "Christ" is indicative of union. For unless He who is by nature devoid of flesh, had become incarnate by dispensation and descended to such self-emptying, it would not befit Him to be anointed; for He is anointed by His own Spirit, since He is God, because having been made man, He who was not fitting to be anointed, that as the first-fruits of the human race He might send to us the grace of anointing, anointed not for Himself but for us. Therefore it is utterly before and full of all wickedness that which some deluded person imagines: that the flesh of the Word incarnate subsisted before the union of incarnation and that he fancies two natures before the union as in a dream: for these pertain to the place [...] who strives to affix insult to the voice of holy Cyril, which is diligently polished and says: "Cease to divide the natures after the union?"<sup><a href="#fn378" id="fn378-ref">378</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">For because in thought only and as in subtle contemplation we separate those things from which Christ is, and we acknowledge the natural conjunction of two certain things, of divinity and humanity, at the same time also enters the thought of union and as it were cries out: Know, therefore, the difference according to nature and property, now do not remain in that. For it is abolished, after the thought of union, the division into two, those things indeed remaining without diminution and immutably, from which the union was made, but subsisting in composition: and not in singular properties according to subsistence, so that they also be counted as two; but from both they absolve one nature and hypostasis, namely the nature and hypostasis of the Word incarnate. For "one" is predicated not only of simple things, but also of those which are understood according to composition. That which is one according to composition is usually separated in contemplation only, so that those things from which it is composed are acknowledged; according to hypostasis indeed it is not separated, nor is it now dissolved into two, ceasing to be one. For, after the thought of union, those things which seemed to be seen as two natures and hypostases in separation according to contemplation, are now not two, because from each that which according to composition is one is absolved.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Nor will they effect this: "Cease to divide the natures after the union" was not said according to that temporal distinction, as if someone would think there were two natures before the union and incarnation, but to the mind of those who examine and wish to learn, as far as possible, the inconfused and at the same time inseparable bond of union. For you have seen, he says, as in thought the natural difference, and as one thing and another divinity and humanity, from which the one Christ is held, and you have separated those things which are considered in contemplation, and you have acknowledged that neither mutation nor confusion of them has been made; when you have understood the union, cease to divide the natures after the thought of union: for by that thought with which you separate, with the same, where you join those things from which Christ is, you conceive one hypostasis and nature of God the Word incarnate, and now not two natures; for two natures are the consummation of division, but not of union.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But that these things are not mine, let it be plain, I will append the voices of holy Cyril, which by the very words manifestly confirm the things said, indeed show that those things also were said from the very utterances of Cyril, and only the arrangement of the enunciation has been supplied by us. For in the second tome against the blasphemies of Nestorius he writes thus: CYRIL: "Cease to divide the natures after the union; for, to know that the divine and human nature are one thing and another is indeed fitting and necessary for prudent men, for they differ from each other, and indeed by immeasurable differences,—but when we bring them into the true and hypostatic union of the Savior of all of us Christ, reject division: for thus you will confess one Christ, and Son and Lord."<sup><a href="#fn379" id="fn379-ref">379</a></sup> Behold how he commands Nestorius himself to bring them together into union; and it is evident that he, after he has joined them in thought, will reject the division and separation made as in thought. It is plain therefore that to him who considers the mystery of the dispensation of inhumanation it is said: "Cease to divide the natures after the union," that is, after the thought of union.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But that "not to divide the natures after the union" is not "to say two natures," but "to confess one incarnate nature," he himself again, in the same tome, manifestly signified thus: CYRIL: "For one nature is now conceived after the union, namely the nature of the Word itself, incarnate, just as it is also fittingly understood concerning ourselves. For man is one in truth, composed from things dissimilar among themselves, from soul, I say, and body. Moreover it is necessary that we also say that that body, which was united to God the Word, was animated by rational soul."<sup><a href="#fn380" id="fn380-ref">380</a></sup> And in the epistle to Acacius, bishop of Melitene, he shows most manifestly that according to the thought of the ineffable and true and natural union, the intellect of him who has considered and examines the incarnation rises up even to that which is done in thought and contemplation, and only for recognizing the difference of nature, it is said: "Cease to divide the natures after the union." And his words are thus: CYRIL: "Wherefore therefore we say that those things, from which the one and only Son and Lord Jesus Christ is, as in thoughts are two natures united; but, after the union, as if the division into two has now been removed, we believe there is one nature of the Son, as of one, but inhumanated and incarnate."<sup><a href="#fn381" id="fn381-ref">381</a></sup> AND AGAIN, A LITTLE LATER: "When therefore the mode of His incarnation is inquired by subtle reasoning, the human intellect clearly sees two things ineffably and inconfusedly conjoined among themselves according to union; but nevertheless, where they are united, in no way does it separate them, but believes the one who is from both to be God and Son and Christ and Lord and confesses indivisibly."<sup><a href="#fn382" id="fn382-ref">382</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">To whom therefore is it not manifest from these things that to the human intellect, which considers and examines and as in mere thoughts separates and sees those two things, which are ineffably and inconfusedly conjoined among themselves, and again in the same thoughts contemplates those things which are separated in contemplation, it is said after the union and after its thought to cease from the division, which contemplation distinguishes, because it sees one hypostasis and nature of the Word incarnate from both, but not again two natures after the union?</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But if, proceeding, anyone shows that holy Cyril somewhere says: "And so, after the union, we say Christ to be in two natures or substances hypostatically united," as the Grammarian elicits. But he cannot show this: for everywhere Cyril introduces this assertion after the union, namely that there is one nature of the Son Himself incarnate. How then do these, being foolish and daring against those very things which are evident, not consider that the demonstration of this word "two" is division and separation, and that he who is compacted from composition into indivisible singularity and is in one hypostasis and nature,—such a thing is man similar to us,—is said "two" by no one according to thought, who has not divided in contemplation. And again it is ready to hear the voice of holy Cyril crying this. For in the second epistle to Succensus, to some objecting a grave and difficult problem: "How will we not concede two natures to subsist after the union indivisibly?"<sup><a href="#fn383" id="fn383-ref">383</a></sup>, he writes thus. CYRIL: "But again and no less it opposes the proposal of those who say there is one nature of the Son incarnate, and wishing to show this inept, everywhere it strives to show two natures subsisting. But it escapes them that all those things which are usually separated by contemplation alone, utterly also recede from each other altogether and singly into distinct diversity. But let man similar to us be again for us an example. For we understand two natures also concerning him, one of soul, the other of body. But separated by mere thoughts and subtle contemplations or intellectual phantasies, perceiving the difference, we do not place them apart as natures, nor again do we permit the whole force of division into them, but we understand them to be one, so that those two natures are not now two, but from both one animal is absolved."<sup><a href="#fn384" id="fn384-ref">384</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, O Grammarian, if you had followed holy Cyril and had not had a mind full of impiety, but had heard him saying: CYRIL: "For 'one' is truly said not only concerning those things which are simple according to nature, but also concerning those things which are gathered according to composition,"<sup><a href="#fn385" id="fn385-ref">385</a></sup> and that they are usually separated by contemplation alone, but after the thought of union, "as if the division into two has now been removed, we believe there is one nature of the Son, as of one, but inhumanated and incarnate,"<sup><a href="#fn386" id="fn386-ref">386</a></sup> and manifestly crying: "so that those two natures are not now two, but from both one animal is absolved,"<sup><a href="#fn387" id="fn387-ref">387</a></sup>—you would certainly not have dared foolishly and impiously to ask these things: THE GRAMMARIAN: "Is it not as if the union had now been removed and dissolved, according to the impious doctrine of those who deprave the Scriptures and say that God the Word laid aside the flesh from Himself after the ascension into heaven? For thus in truth according to the madmen, one nature which was before in the union being rejected after the union, it comes about that one nature remains after the union. Or indeed they will fear this opinion, fearing lest they be refuted as those who strip God the Word of flesh, but they will say that the union indeed remains, but that one nature is absolved? But we to these things will say, the union remaining, two natures also remain in the union; but if not, the union is not held."<sup><a href="#fn388" id="fn388-ref">388</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Behold indeed, comparing between themselves the words of the wise mystagogue and your polluted words, it is plain to all that you fight not against me, but against him. For those things from which the one Christ subsists perfectly and without defect according to composition, can in no other way be called two, unless someone separates them by contemplation alone, so that after the thought of union, those things which seemed two in subtle thoughts, are now not two, but we see from both one hypostasis and nature of the Word incarnate absolved. And you, who say two natures after the union, although you say "indivisible and united," as if you dissolve that one according to composition insoluble and badly remaining in the separation made in the intellect and perfectly dissect, hear holy Cyril saying: CYRIL: "But again and no less it opposes the proposal of those who say there is one nature of the Son incarnate, and wishing to show this inept, everywhere it strives to show two natures subsisting."<sup><a href="#fn389" id="fn389-ref">389</a></sup> For they do not subsist, as we have often said, in their own singularities of their subsistence, but rather in composition, since they have not indeed lost what they were, but are hindered from subsisting in duality because of the union, which from both shows one nature of God the Word incarnate.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore opposing wise Cyril, who says: "so that those two natures are not now two, but from both one is absolved,"<sup><a href="#fn390" id="fn390-ref">390</a></sup> you, O impious one, not only do not wish to do this, but writing: THE GRAMMARIAN: "For thus in truth according to the madmen, one nature, which was before in the union, being excluded, it comes about that one nature remains after the union,"<sup><a href="#fn391" id="fn391-ref">391</a></sup> and you fight for impiety; saying: "the union remaining, two natures also absolutely remain; but if not, the union is not held."<sup><a href="#fn392" id="fn392-ref">392</a></sup> And you know not that this foolishness is turned upon your own head, which we bring forth against you, saying—indeed nothing from our own—the words of holy Cyril, in the defense of the tenth anathematism against the reprehensions of the impious Theodoret, which are thus: CYRIL: "For if the union is true, they are not absolutely two, but from both one and only Christ is understood;"<sup><a href="#fn393" id="fn393-ref">393</a></sup> again, in the epistle to Acacius: "but, after the union, as if the division into two has now been removed, we believe there is one nature of the Son, as of one, but inhumanated and incarnate;"<sup><a href="#fn394" id="fn394-ref">394</a></sup> and in the second epistle to Succensus: "so that those two natures are not now two, but from both one animal is absolved."<sup><a href="#fn395" id="fn395-ref">395</a></sup> For union is held from two or from many things; but that which is perfected from it is one, but not two or more: for that would be nothing else than that one being dissolved into those things from which it is compacted. For if in two natures or substances subsisting, as you say contentiously and impiously, Christ were acknowledged, what need would there be to divide in thought or as in subtle contemplations Him who would indeed be separated by duality, but who being proclaimed without division, would put on the form and deny the power of true union, as the Apostle says somewhere?</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That Nestorius also argued the dissipation and destruction of one nature, and that in vain they brandish darts, contaminating their blasphemy, asserting they say one Christ not indeed two hypostases, but two substances; and that the hypostatic union the doctors of the Church also called union according to substance.</em></p>

        <p class="paragraph">With an evil spirit, which drove Nestorius to insanity, he also speaks, speaking similar words against those who confess there to be one nature of God the Word incarnate and refuse to say two natures after the union, from those things which are written by that impious one against holy Cyril, in the memoranda which he fabricated as if composed at Ephesus: NESTORIUS: "He confuses the hypostasis of God the Word with the mutability of carnal hypostasis, when he says one substance of the divinity of the Son and of flesh, so that He appears wholly either uncreated or created, and utterly deletes the confession of one nature, whether of the uncreated nature of divinity, which assumed our humanity, or of the created humanity, which was assumed."<sup><a href="#fn396" id="fn396-ref">396</a></sup> And in his own book, which he inscribed: "Against the Theopaschites or Cyrillians," composed through interrogation and response, he wrote these things: NESTORIUS: "Theopaschites: And how will we be accused of the composition of the duality of natures, we who say Christ is one nature of God incarnate? — The orthodox says: That very thing of which you accuse, you think the composition of those things, of which you accuse. For you have confessed that from you Christ is established to be one nature from incorporeality and body, and a uninatural hypostasis. But that is confusion of two natures, which strips natures of their proper hypostases, when they are confused among themselves."<sup><a href="#fn397" id="fn397-ref">397</a></sup> Attend therefore, O Grammarian, how you follow the footsteps of this insanity or fury. This one says against wise Cyril: NESTORIUS: "He confuses the hypostasis of God the Word with the mutability of carnal hypostasis, when he says one substance of the divinity of the Son and of flesh."<sup><a href="#fn398" id="fn398-ref">398</a></sup> You also against me have said: THE GRAMMARIAN: "But what also is this? He does not leave one substance, but fully disturbs and confuses," and in the first chapter of your foolish book similarly: "How therefore in one substance after the incarnation is the Son of God?"<sup><a href="#fn399" id="fn399-ref">399</a></sup> Again Nestorius said, accusing Cyril of destruction of one nature: NESTORIUS: "and utterly deletes the confession of one nature;"<sup><a href="#fn400" id="fn400-ref">400</a></sup> and you, made similar to your mendacious father, profess a similar accusation and say: THE GRAMMARIAN: "and it comes about that one nature results after the union."<sup><a href="#fn401" id="fn401-ref">401</a></sup> And again Nestorius, after he had proceeded from the calumny of confusion and from the accusation of destruction of one nature, also accused us, because we said one nature of God the Word incarnate, from divinity and from humanity, and said: "You establish Christ to be from incorporeality and body, and a uninatural hypostasis. But that is confusion of two natures, which strips natures of their proper hypostases, when they are confused among themselves."<sup><a href="#fn402" id="fn402-ref">402</a></sup> You also, like this one, have turned to the same species of accusation, bearing the image of your impious father and saying: THE GRAMMARIAN: "But they will say the union indeed remains, but that one nature is absolved. But we to these things will say, the union remaining, two natures also remain in the union; but if not, the union is not held."<sup><a href="#fn403" id="fn403-ref">403</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">But you will perhaps say, O Grammarian, that Nestorius does not wish, as he himself also said, natures to be stripped of their hypostases, but you understand natures not as hypostases, but as substances. But know that for deception from your substitution of names you have received no utility. For this Nestorius also knew to call natures "substances," as we have already shown above. Nevertheless, we will adduce another testimony of his, which is found in the epistle written against the second epistle of holy Cyril to him, in which epistle this is held: NESTORIUS: "For because He was about to make mention of death, lest anyone from this should suspect God the Word to be passible, He applies the name 'Christ', as an appellation significative of the impassible and passible in one singular person of substance, so that both impassible and passible without peril Christ can be called, impassible indeed according to divinity, but passible according to the nature of the body."<sup><a href="#fn404" id="fn404-ref">404</a></sup> And he who understands and calls natures, as you do, as "substances," also confesses them "united," again as you do. For in the oration whose title is: "When it was read: 'How often will my brother sin against me and I forgive him?'"<sup><a href="#fn405" id="fn405-ref">405</a></sup>, and before it another bishop had spoken concerning longanimity, and whose beginning is: "Beautiful what the preceding doctor narrated,"<sup><a href="#fn406" id="fn406-ref">406</a></sup> he wrote thus: NESTORIUS: "I indeed, that is, the person of the Church, with whomever I speak, the same I set before all, calling Christ perfect God and perfect man, the natures not commingled but united."<sup><a href="#fn407" id="fn407-ref">407</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">How therefore, O thrice unhappy one, do you think to adorn the words of your foolishness by saying indeed that you confess two substances and natures inseparable, but denying two hypostases in appearance, and writing these things? THE GRAMMARIAN: "Therefore the flesh of God the Word was not of another, and before the assumption it did not exist, how shall I say in two proper hypostases, and shall I call another hypostasis that very flesh, which separately neither subsisted nor had any existence, but always subsisted in God the Word? But that the flesh did not subsist without God the Word, Athanasius testifies, who in the epistle to Jovinian concerning the orthodox faith wrote: 'For at the same time flesh, at the same time flesh of God the Word, at the same time flesh animated by rational soul, at the same time flesh of God the Word animated by rational soul: for in Him it also had subsistence.'"<sup><a href="#fn408" id="fn408-ref">408</a></sup> Come now, explain to us, O excellent one,—for by your most subtle instructions we are led to interrogate your Prudence,—if therefore you do not call that particular flesh, which God the Word united to Himself, because it does not at all subsist separately, a hypostasis, and you say Christ is in two hypostases, how do you call this very flesh "substance" and say that Christ is "in two substances," unless because according to common signification you call the substance of flesh the whole genus of humanity, and that, as if existing before the inhumanation, united to the substance of divinity, and thus you confess Christ "in two substances united"? But that is manifestly madness and most evil insanity, as has been shown in many ways. For not thus according to common signification the substance of divinity, that is, the holy Trinity, is incarnate to the substance and whole genus of humanity; for this opinion obtains the derision of impiety, to which from your fables we are often compelled to come down by your loquacity. If indeed, as you have confessed with us, as placed above, to one and particular flesh the hypostasis of God the Word is incarnate, and if you call that flesh "substance," do not cut it off from the Word by duality, if it please you that it was not endowed with existence before the union with the Word. For just as it did not first subsist singly and separately without the Word, so neither was it according to substance, nor did it exist: for to be according to substance and to exist is the same as to subsist, nor do these names differ at all among themselves in this respect. Wherefore that union, which holy Cyril called "hypostatic," Gregory the Theologian named "union according to substance," in the epistle to Cledonius, writing thus: GREGORY: "If anyone says the Word in Christ operated as in a prophet by grace, but not according to substance humanity adhered to divinity and was formed, let him be void of superior efficacy, indeed full of contrary things."<sup><a href="#fn409" id="fn409-ref">409</a></sup> But the venerable bishops, who were gathered to effect the deposition of the Samosatene Paul and, the deed itself having been done, composed that very epistle concerning his deposition, wrote the same thing as Gregory concerning that union to the flesh of God the Word, who is the Father's Wisdom and Power; and thus expanding the error of Paul they wrote: THE SYNOD: "But he conceived an adhesion to Wisdom according to instruction and participation, not indeed according to substance."<sup><a href="#fn410" id="fn410-ref">410</a></sup> For just as hypostatic union signifies that that flesh subsists in that very union to God the Word, in the same way also that union according to substance signifies that in that very union to God the Word it passed over into being and coming into existence, that flesh endowed with soul and mind. And just as we say that flesh does not subsist before it is united in the Word, so we say, it neither is nor exists before it is united to the Word. Therefore, if you say that for this reason Christ is not proclaimed by you in two hypostases, because the flesh before the assumption and union did not subsist, and you truly escape impiety, neither will you say Christ is "in two substances": for both formulas are the same, as far as impiety is concerned, because before the assumption and union the flesh neither was, nor was it already endowed with existence. Behold, for unwillingly you have confessed that to say two after the union is of those who assert that the flesh existed before the union and assumption, and first formed in the Virgin they say plausibly that God entered into him and dwelt in him, as Diodorus says, and likewise Theodore and Nestorius and Theodoret: who also themselves said that two natures and substances and hypostases are that one Christ, as the discourse shows. Why therefore, O excellent one, do you afflict hypostases and call them separated and reveal their separation, but you love and protect natures and substances, and call them indivisible and united, in this also existing as a judge of iniquity and oppressing truth and therefore not escaping correction. And you are defiled in the inheritance of your tongue, more defiled in your deceptive, as you think, garment... who indeed hypostatic and true and natural union you confess to be proclaimed by you and bring forward holy Athanasius and Cyril with polluted mouth, but the duality of nature and of substances and of hypostases and of persons, the offspring of habitual union, you confess and with the dye of right names, like a harlot, you paint. Hear therefore fittingly Jeremiah the prophet, indeed God, who speaks in him, saying: "If you clothe yourself with scarlet and adorn yourself with golden ornament, and if with antimony you lift up your eyes, in vain will be your adornment."<sup><a href="#fn411" id="fn411-ref">411</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That, beyond impiety, it also pertains to unlearning and to novelty full of ignorance, that which is said: "Because we say Christ consubstantial with God and the Father according to divinity, and consubstantial with us according to humanity, therefore we confess Him in two substances, but not in two hypostases, because we say Him neither co-hypostatic with the Father, nor co-hypostatic with us."</em></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Behold, the foolishness of impiety, with copious abundance, like mud, overflows and pours itself out from your mouth, hides your machinations and deceitful falsehoods, which I, because of the foul odor of them, will take care to refute with only a few words, since all similarly and perfectly bear before them the magnitude of stupidity and blasphemy; lest however anything be hidden from those encountering the things which you have loquacitely repeated in words, I am compelled to refute again, repeating your words, in which you seem not only to blaspheme doctrines, but also to innovate insane names, writing these things: THE GRAMMARIAN: "But perhaps those will say, who think nothing sound: 'If you say "in two natures", absolutely also "in two hypostases" you say Christ.' To resist these is not difficult for us; for we bring forward the voices of the Fathers, because from them we have learned to say Christ consubstantial with God and the Father and consubstantial with us, we say Him in two natures, that is, substances. Therefore, if anyone is sought among the doctors with them, who taught them to say the Son is co-hypostatic with the Father and again co-hypostatic with us, let not his face be hidden, but let him bring forth into the light his excellent and lucid doctrines. For these things, gathered from heretical instruction, he speaks as if orthodox to the simple. For that opinion, which confesses the Son co-hypostatic with the Father, is to the likeness of the opinion of Sabellius; but that Christ is again co-hypostatic with us, no one has dreamed to say. Whence, because we say Christ consubstantial with the Father and consubstantial with us, we say Him to be in two substances; but to say Him in two marked hypostases we avoid: for no one said co-hypostatic with the Father."<sup><a href="#fn412" id="fn412-ref">412</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">And from whom is it hidden, O most foolish of all men and blind with impiety and utterly ignorant of the things you say, that substance and hypostasis, insofar as they are and subsist, are the same? For the latter is called by the former; but to be and to subsist is to exist; and we have cited the vigorous and wise Athanasius, writing thus to the bishops established in Africa: ATHANASIUS: "For hypostasis and substance is existence; for it is and exists;"<sup><a href="#fn413" id="fn413-ref">413</a></sup> and you yourself appended this in your lamentable little book and said. Nor will you deny that substance and hypostasis, participating in subsisting and being and existing, are separated and removed from each other by a great and immense interval, insofar as substance indeed is significative of genus and community, but hypostasis of a certain one species such as is subject to genus. And that, in the things considered before, we cited holy Basil indeed writing thus: BASIL: "But substance and hypostasis have this difference between themselves, which that which is common has to that which is individual, for example, such as animal has to that man;"<sup><a href="#fn414" id="fn414-ref">414</a></sup> but wise Cyril, as if through interrogation and response, thus saying: CYRIL: "B. Therefore substance is one thing and hypostasis another? — A. Yes, it is another, since substance is comprehensive of all hypostases,"<sup><a href="#fn415" id="fn415-ref">415</a></sup> AND AGAIN: "Substance therefore will be understood of every man, as bringing forth the common account of genus, but hypostasis more fittingly of one."<sup><a href="#fn416" id="fn416-ref">416</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Where therefore the Fathers,—whom, as you say, you follow, while you stray very far from their opinion,—say Christ consubstantial indeed with the Father according to divinity, but the same consubstantial with us men according to humanity, because from both immutably and indivisibly He is one, from the divinity of the Word and from one human flesh, born from Mary, rationally animated and endowed with mind, they confess the kinship of the substances and genera, to which kinship Emmanuel has, who from things diverse according to substance [...] is inconfusedly composed, just as also the most wise Cyril, writing to Acacius, bishop of Melitene, thus said: "But we say the dispensation coition and ineffable truly to have been made of things dissimilar among themselves into indivisible union."<sup><a href="#fn417" id="fn417-ref">417</a></sup> Therefore, just as that man, for example Peter,—for again I approach with the same words,—is composed from things diverse according to substance, namely from one soul and one body, and the soul indeed has kinship to rational and human souls and is of the same substance and genus and consubstantial with them, but the body is homogeneous and consubstantial with mortal and human bodies, existing of the same substance and genus, but not therefore is Peter composed from the substance and genera, who subsists from one soul and one body, and is one nature and hypostasis composed, consubstantial indeed with rational souls according to rationality, capable of intellect and knowledge, consubstantial moreover with homogeneous and human bodies according to mortality, one and the same Peter is rational and mortal:—so also Emmanuel, since from one hypostasis of God the Word and one flesh rationally animated and from both He is one and one nature of the Word incarnate, He will not be thought impiously and unlearnedly composed from generic substances because He has kinship to the Father indeed and the Holy Spirit according to the substance of divinity, but the same has kinship to us according to the substance of humanity. Nor does anyone have his hypostasis through those who are kin with him, but existing diverse and separated according to the account of his genus and consubstantiality. For each one of us also, subsisting from two, namely from his body and his soul, is not thought to subsist from homogeneous men and from the whole substance at once of rational souls and the whole substance of human bodies, nor is he believed to have his hypostasis in two substances and two genera, according to your impious and improbable and impossible garrulity.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">But this name "substance" used according to common signification, likewise the name "consubstantial," are indicative of kinship wise John, bishop of Constantinople, in the seventy-fourth explanatory expositionary oration on the Gospel of John, manifestly teaches, writing these things: JOHN: "Believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me. Indeed it behooved you, hearing the Father and the Son, to seek nothing else for the demonstration of kinship according to substance. But if this is not enough for you for showing equality of honor and consubstantiality, learn also from the works!"<sup><a href="#fn418" id="fn418-ref">418</a></sup> And in the seventy-fifth oration similarly he writes thus: JOHN: "I will ask the Father, and another Paraclete He will give you, that is, another such as I am. Let those also be ashamed, who labor with the disease of Sabellius and those who have an opinion not agreeing concerning the Spirit. For even the arrangement of the voice itself is such, that it cuts down heresies diametrically opposed with one blow. For by saying indeed 'another', it shows the difference of hypostasis, but by saying 'Paraclete' it shows the kinship of substance."<sup><a href="#fn419" id="fn419-ref">419</a></sup> The excellent interpreter of divine dogmas, Cyril, shows the same, in the defense of the eleventh anathematism, constructing a defense against the reprehensions of Andrew: CYRIL: "But just as the proper body of each one of us is said, which is properly his, so also it is to be understood concerning the one Christ. For although the body of Christ is homogeneous or consubstantial with our bodies,—for it is from a woman,—it is understood and said, as I said, to be His proper."<sup><a href="#fn420" id="fn420-ref">420</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">When therefore Jesus Christ, God the Word incarnate for us and immutably and perfectly made man, is consubstantial with the Father indeed and the Spirit according to the substance and common signification and generic property of divinity, but the same also is made and is consubstantial with us, and now also is and always remains, according to the substance and common genus of humanity, how so inconveniently and unlearnedly from names indicating kinship do you gather the absurd, saying: "If Christ is consubstantial with the Father and consubstantial with us, therefore He is in two substances?" For, from one hypostasis of God the Word and from one flesh rationally animated, is Christ from both one and only, O wise one, not however from substances having kinship among themselves, from which He is compacted. For it is also of foolish opinion to say that Christ subsists in generic substances, who is and subsists in one hypostasis, namely in the hypostasis of the Word incarnate to the flesh born from Mary, endowed with soul and mind. Nor is He divided into generic substances, to which He has kinship and are referred those things from which He is compacted. For it is one thing and very diverse and not at all the same to confess from which things Christ is, and another to know to which things those things from which Christ is are homogeneous and consubstantial. For from the very hypostasis of God the Word and from flesh rationally animated He is and is compacted by that conjunction according to natural union; but from these indeed that is referred to the generic substance of divinity and is consubstantial with the Father and the Spirit, but this is referred to the generic substance of humanity and is homogeneous and consubstantial with us, all men: and thus that from both one and only Christ, insofar indeed as He is Word, is consubstantial with the Father and the Spirit, but insofar as perfectly and immutably made man, not having departed from what He was, the same is also consubstantial with us.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">How therefore, using the snares of heretical madness,—for I will not say cunning,—do you not confess those things from which Christ is, but bring forward into the midst those things to which He is homogeneous, and with blasphemous and untaught speech, while you refer your unlearning and likewise impiety to the holy Fathers, you say: THE GRAMMARIAN: "Adhering to the words of the holy Fathers, because we have learned from them to say Christ consubstantial with the Father and God and consubstantial with us, we say Him in two natures, that is, substances,"<sup><a href="#fn421" id="fn421-ref">421</a></sup> and thus, after you have distracted and changed the order of things, and gathered one thing for another, you add the most absurd and inflict injury at will and by force at once upon things and names? For who will not wonder at your wisdom, when you say: "Because no one said the Son co-hypostatic with the Father and again co-hypostatic with us according to likeness, we avoid saying two marked hypostases?"<sup><a href="#fn422" id="fn422-ref">422</a></sup> Truly, it is ready to say to this. You have also gathered that first absurdity, who from this, that the appellation "consubstantial" is indicative of kinship, you established Christ to be in two substances according to common signification and generic property understood; you also by force introduce another very foolish and too absurd thing, that the name "hypostasis" be brought forward and said beyond its proper signification and rule. For it is certain that the word "hypostasis" is significative neither of community nor of kinship, but is the very person or thing of someone, which falls under and is subordinate to a genus, for example, just as John, it can be said, falls into the substance and genus of humanity, or the one soul of any individual, falls into the genus of rational and human souls, or one body falls into the genus and substance of human bodies. If, therefore, hypostasis held the place of genus and common signification, someone could call Peter co-hypostatic with Paul. But, because it is a comprehensive word of one person and of such a species, how could anyone, according to your stupidity, say Peter is όμοπρόσωπον (same person) with Paul, or God the Father with God and the Word and the Son and the Only-begotten? For it is not consequent that by the name of generic substance the singular hypostasis is also named equally and similarly. For just as the things which are designated by these names differ and are distant from each other, so also the names designating them must necessarily be distinct from each other and not be applied similarly. Since, therefore, substance holds the place of genus, and comprehends in itself all hypostases subordinated to it, for example, since the substance of humanity comprehends Peter and Paul and John, all men who are under that genus will consequently be called consubstantial and homogeneous; but since hypostasis comprises one person, and such a species, and comprehends no other, to what will it be co-hypostatic? It would remain that someone would be co-hypostatic to himself: which is of extreme stupidity. Nor would anyone, unless he were out of his mind, say that Peter, because he is said to be consubstantial and homogeneous with Paul, must also be said to be co-hypostatic and όμοπρόσωπον with him. For he would hear from us, and indeed with the best right: Just as the supposit of substance and of hypostasis is not the same, — for the former signifies what is common, and the genus of men, but the latter signifies that particular and determined man, — so it is consequent that, according to the diversity of supposits, the names also are diverse, and by no means are all things said equally and similarly by the same word.<sup><a href="#fn423" id="fn423-ref">423</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Since, however, these things so hold themselves without confusion and are distant from each other, nor does anyone perversely establish that other thing, — which we have already said before, — namely that, because Peter's soul is consubstantial and homogeneous with rational souls, but not co-hypostatic, and likewise Peter's body is consubstantial and homogeneous with human bodies, but not co-hypostatic, therefore Peter must be said to be in two substances, but not in two hypostases. To him it would truly be said that both are false. For, since Peter is composed of one soul and one body into one composite nature and one hypostasis, he is not mingled or confused with human bodies and with rational souls, so that he is even said to be co-hypostatic with them; and again, because he is homogeneous and consubstantial with them according to soul and body, he is not for that reason divided into two substances and two genera: for thus he who is not composed from generic substances, but, as has been said, from one soul and one body, which have kinship to diverse substances, is not on that account divided with those substances or genera. Therefore, to what necessity or persuasion will your so improbable and unlearned syllogism attract your interlocutor: "Because certainly the Son is not said to be co-hypostatic with the Father, nor co-hypostatic with us, I do not say Him to be in two hypostases"? For what foundation does that saying have, or what stability indeed?<sup><a href="#fn424" id="fn424-ref">424</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Who among the heresiarchs, as you said, spoke this word, which does not even keep consequence according to superficial opinion, — for now I set aside impiety and pass over in silence. For Sabellius said the Trinity was a three-named hypostasis, which sometimes indeed dominates and speaks and operates as the person of the Father, but sometimes as the Son, but sometimes as the Holy Spirit. But never did he say one and the same hypostasis was co-hypostatic: for no one is said to be co-hypostatic to himself. For just as someone is said to be consubstantial with another, who shares the same substance and kinship with him, so he would also be said to be co-hypostatic as to another, if hypostasis were not of one, but comprehensive of many subsisting persons. But, because Sabellius posited one hypostasis represented under persons and triply diverse, he did not seem to say co-hypostatic. And hear the wise Basil teaching these things in the epistle to Terentius thus: BASIL: "What calumny can be more grave than this for moving many, than if any of us seem to say one hypostasis of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit; who, even if they manifestly teach the difference of persons, — because however this was first assumed by Sabellius, he himself saying this, namely that God is indeed one according to hypostasis, but diversely represented by the Scriptures under persons according to the property of the use occurring in turn, and accommodates the words to himself now as the Father, when the occasion of this person is present, but now those which befit the Son, when he descends to our care or to other certain dispensatory operations, but now puts on the person of the Spirit, when the time requires the words as spoken by such a person, — if any even among us seem to say one according to the subject the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, but confess three perfect persons, how will they not think they bring open and undoubted demonstration of the truth of those things which are said about us?"<sup><a href="#fn425" id="fn425-ref">425</a></sup> But in that to the canonical epistle, of which we made mention in the things considered before when we spoke about the word "consubstantial," he wrote thus: BASIL: "But this word also corrects the practice of Sabellius: for it removes the identity of hypostases and indicates the perfect notion of persons. For nothing is consubstantial to itself, but one thing to another."<sup><a href="#fn426" id="fn426-ref">426</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">And therefore by these words concerning one and the same hypostasis it is said by no one that anything is co-hypostatic to itself, because nothing is said to be consubstantial to itself, but one thing to another. For since the holy Trinity is definite and holds itself without confusion according to the diversity of persons, and the Father is Father, and by no means the Son or the Spirit, and the Son is Son, and by no means changed into the Father or the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is Holy Spirit, and by no means declines to be Father or Son, therefore, on account of that which is common, and on account of the identity of the substance of divinity, each hypostasis is said to be consubstantial with the others. If indeed, as the impious Sabellius says, — there is one and the same hypostasis, figured under three names and falsely simulating the differentiation of persons without hypostases and fictitiously said, how can this one hypostasis be said to be co-hypostatic to itself? In the epistle indeed to Amphilochius concerning the error of Sabellius we find Saint Basil writing these things: BASIL: "But those who say substance and hypostasis are the same, are compelled to confess only persons differing, and while they flee from saying three hypostases, they are found not to escape the malice of Sabellius; who also himself in many places, while he confuses the notion, changes the persons separately, saying the same hypostasis is figured for the use always occurring."<sup><a href="#fn427" id="fn427-ref">427</a></sup> And to the monks subject to him, in Eurobia and Chalane, writing, he says thus: BASIL: "For we equally flee and anathematize those who labor with the disease of Sabellius, and those who teach the dogmas of Arius, as impious. If anyone says the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit are the same, establishing one thing many-named and one hypostasis named by three appellations: such we place in the part of the godless. Likewise also if anyone says the Son is unlike the Father according to substance, or drags down the Holy Spirit to a creature, him we anathematize and teach that he approaches the error of paganism."<sup><a href="#fn428" id="fn428-ref">428</a></sup> And Gregory the Theologian, in the Apologetic Oration, wrote these things: GREGORY: "lest, while speech is brought to one hypostasis through fear of polytheism, empty names be left for us who think the same Father and Son and Holy Spirit to be... nor through this new resolution or composition do we come into that of Sabellius."<sup><a href="#fn429" id="fn429-ref">429</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Whence therefore, O Grammarian, these things, which are according to nature abominable, and not even fabricated by heretics, as most foolish, and which are found outside common appellations? But you newly decree and according to your own will establish names and, according to the apostolic reproof, teach otherwise and do not acquiesce to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the doctrines of justice, and you are proud, and knowing nothing you proceed into the midst and as if erudite in divine dogmas you write: THE GRAMMARIAN: "For that opinion, which says the Son is co-hypostatic with the Father, is to the likeness of Sabellius."<sup><a href="#fn430" id="fn430-ref">430</a></sup> Therefore show us where ever Sabellius said one hypostasis co-hypostatic. For he who says one hypostasis of Father and Son and Holy Spirit, how would he say it to be co-hypostatic to itself? These things are ridiculous and full of madness. And perhaps, because the profane narratives, which you profess to hand down to those who are your disciples, narrate such beings are fashioned, and because with certain deer also it is named, you have also imagined it permitted for you to fabricate those co-hypostatics and to arise in the holy Church as if before a comic scene and to order divine things to be said.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">And who having sense, I do not say spiritual and exalted and high, but common and natural prudence, when hearing these things does not become heavy, not to say laugh, seeing you, who are alien in these names and opinions, dare to mock sacred dogmas? Nevertheless again now Jeremiah will grieve with the Church and mystically, as if from his person lament, saying: "For he has seen nations entering your sanctuary, concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your church,"<sup><a href="#fn431" id="fn431-ref">431</a></sup> again: "Therefore our eyes failed looking upon Mount Zion, because it is desolate; foxes have walked upon it;"<sup><a href="#fn432" id="fn432-ref">432</a></sup> for with these alien and profane and unusual and impossible and by none enunciated and contrary to and fighting against the nature of things and from it confuted presumptions, as if relying on examined presumptions, and saying: "In two hypostases indeed I do not say Christ, but in two natures, that is, substances, because no one said Christ co-hypostatic with the Father or co-hypostatic with us," — this jest indeed "co-hypostatic with the Father" you have falsely ascribed to the madness of Sabellius, not knowing what you say, as the discourse shows, but that jest, "Christ is co-hypostatic with us" you said was never said by anyone. Why therefore from those things which are said by no one, as if from true things, do you establish principles of presumptions, and laying a foundation upon abominable sand, as upon the firmness of impiety do you build many weak things?<sup><a href="#fn433" id="fn433-ref">433</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">For we condemn you as dividing the one Christ, not on account of those impossible co-hypostatics, — from where you have them, we do not know, — but because you say two natures indivisible and united after the union, and now also again you object against Saint Cyril those things which are appended in the second epistle to Succensus in the manner of an objection, and with those who now object you cry: "How do we not concede two natures to subsist indivisibly after the union?"<sup><a href="#fn434" id="fn434-ref">434</a></sup>; and you do not hear him saying: CYRIL: "But again and no less it opposes the proposal of those who say there is one nature of the Son incarnate, and wishing to show this inept, everywhere it strives to show two natures subsisting."<sup><a href="#fn435" id="fn435-ref">435</a></sup> And fleeing from reproof, you hide yourself in substances, like wild beasts which hide in dense reeds or shady woods: "concerning whom David the prophet sings to God of all: 'Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds,'"<sup><a href="#fn436" id="fn436-ref">436</a></sup> "wild beasts of the reeds" certainly calling those who write with heretical pens secretly and in a serpentine manner: which beasts to hunt and tame and, after correction, to convert to docility is the work of the doctors of piety alone, who with the apostles through the voice of Jeremiah hear: "Behold, I send many fishers, says the Lord, and they will fish them; and after these things I will send many hunters, and they will hunt them over every mountain and over every hill and out of the holes of the rocks."<sup><a href="#fn437" id="fn437-ref">437</a></sup> For you say: THE GRAMMARIAN: "Adhering to the words of the holy Fathers, because we have learned from them to say Christ consubstantial with the Father and God and consubstantial with us, we say Him in two natures, that is, substances."<sup><a href="#fn438" id="fn438-ref">438</a></sup> And you manifestly show from these names, which indicate homogeneity, that one Christ is constituted by you in two substances, holding the place of genus and comprehensive of many hypostases, so that you gather that absurd and impious thing, that namely the holy Trinity is incarnate to the whole of humanity at once. And with that impiety so absurd and irrational, you add another impudence, comparable also to that insanity, wishing to corroborate it, you add: "I do not say Christ is in two hypostases, because I cannot say Him co-hypostatic with the Father, as Sabellius said, nor co-hypostatic with us: which indeed no one said. But because the phrase 'consubstantial with God and the Father' and 'consubstantial with us' is said, therefore I say He is in two substances."<sup><a href="#fn439" id="fn439-ref">439</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">What therefore could anyone say to these things, which together with impiety also proceed beyond all prudence, which hears malice, and do not even keep the consequence of opinion? It is not mine, indeed of no one from men, to say what is fitting to that madness. But let Christ Himself come into the midst, who through the wisdom of typological Solomon, the true and spiritual Solomon and congregator from pelicans, — for that is what the word Solomon signifies in the Hebrew language, — and as God let Him speak strongly and "the lips of the fool swallow him up; the beginning of his words is subtle and the last of his mouth is evil error."<sup><a href="#fn440" id="fn440-ref">440</a></sup> For how would it not be error, which can stand nowhere, but is turned otherwise variously by various mutations into falsehood? For you who say: THE GRAMMARIAN: "For we have learned to say Christ consubstantial with the Father and God and consubstantial with us, we say Him to be in two natures, that is, substances,"<sup><a href="#fn441" id="fn441-ref">441</a></sup> and did not add "the same consubstantial with the Father and the same consubstantial with us," — for this again it is fitting to observe, — and through names indicative of kinship, as we have shown, you define Christ to be in substances according to common signification understood and holding the place of genera, — for you did not say the one Christ subsists, — below you say: "If therefore the flesh of God the Word was not of another, nor existed before conception, how shall I say Him in two proper hypostases and call another hypostasis that flesh, which did not subsist separately, nor at all apart, but only existed in God the Word?"<sup><a href="#fn442" id="fn442-ref">442</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">For to this it pleases to interrogate you: What therefore? Because you say Christ is in two substances, do you say the substance of flesh subsisted before, before conception and union with the Word. And what do you call the substance of flesh? Is it perhaps the human genus? But, God the Word hypostatically united to Himself not the genus, but one body endowed with soul and mind, which is homogeneous and consubstantial to the substance of men, that is, to the whole genus. But if you call that very one body, which you called proper flesh, — manifestly however, body animated by rational soul, — substance, for hypostasis and proper appellation you use the common name "substance," then just as you do not say two hypostases, because before assumption and union it did not subsist, so neither should you say two substances, because before union with God the Word flesh came neither to substance nor to existence, that is, did not pass over into being.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Know therefore that by saying substances, you also say two hypostases, even if you wish to hide. But it is proper to those who place it as not subsisting and fashion an infant before union with God the Word, to say both two natures and two substances and two hypostases after the union, and consequently two persons and two sons and two christs. For to natures which are separated according to duality, or to substances or hypostases subsisting with proper subsistence, proper person is imposed singly to each individually, even if they are adorned with a mutuated person, namely of authority and name and equality of will: and therefore each is called one Christ and Son.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">If anyone, however, according to the apostolic and holy Fathers' institutions, confesses and acknowledges hypostatic union and that God the Word communicated with us in blood and flesh animated by rational soul, and confesses Emmanuel from two natures or hypostases or substances, namely from the nature of God the Word and from one rationally animated flesh, which was assumed from the God-bearing Virgin through the conjunction of natural union: he rightly says both one nature and one hypostasis of God the Word incarnate, and one person and one Christ and Son. For above we have shown how the holy and great mystagogues of the Church often called the hypostasis of God the Word also substance, and again the flesh endowed with soul and mind and born from Mary, which He united to Himself by true union, they called now substance now hypostasis. Again we have shown all the institutions of the excellent Fathers, who accept hypostatic union and in contemplation only separate those things from which Christ is, and acknowledge their difference, because they are united without confusion and diminishment. Since the notions of union do not say two natures, — for those things which do not subsist in proper subsistence nor in divided singularities, but are seen in composition and absolve one from both nature and hypostasis of God the Word incarnate, how could anyone number or speak as two? — therefore through all things prudent investigation and discourse shows that in those things which you impiously wrote, O Grammarian, you only illusionarily prefer hypostatic union, but you deny Him who is absolved from it, insofar as these two things, which appear through separation of contemplation, after the thought of union are indeed not two now, but from both now subsists, according to the voice of wise Cyril.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That the word of the impious Grammarian is false, contending that he was not reproved or refuted in Theodoret, who confesses one Christ to be in two natures after the inexplicable union, by Saint Cyril, because Cyril kept silence, as he says, concerning the nomination of the duality of natures.</em></p>

        <p class="paragraph">But that you are wholly inclined to adversaries, and love duality, the offspring of their pseudonymous and habitual union, and impugn Cyril, the doctor of sound faith, whom under a mendacious person you simulate to have obtained, and with whom you flatter with fair words, but you assist Theodoret, the hater of Cyril and enemy of truth, you have confessed this, when you added these also adulatory words to those things which were written by you with blasphemy thus: THE GRAMMARIAN: "For who persuaded him? He was constructing a defense against the reprehensions of Theodoret, and as if in some palaestra was seeking handles to take the adversary. Where he indeed gave suspicion of insinuation of error of two persons, Cyril was vituperating and kindly dissuading; but where Theodoret was naming two natures, Cyril was silent and consenting and had nothing to say. Nor is it to be said that Cyril was a man by no means loquacious or also unwilling to strike back him who had emitted darts against him: he was preparing against both, burning with zeal for faith; but he hated only one thing, namely according to your manner to calumniate vainly and to overturn those things which he had built."<sup><a href="#fn443" id="fn443-ref">443</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Well and more than well you have constituted the contest and as if fitting combatants you have brought into the palaestra for us the excellent Cyril, powerful in piety and anointed by the Holy Spirit and exercised from his infancy, and that Theodoret unexercised in the fight for piety and laboring with impiety and cast down, and you also interpose yourself in the fight between them, you, unjust and impious arbiter, and say: "Where Theodoret was naming two natures, Saint Cyril was silent and consenting." If therefore, according to your decree, when the unjust Theodoret said that one Christ was two natures, he had found wise Cyril silent and consenting, he would have laudably said two natures; but if, Cyril had contradicted him. But to him who laudably said two natures, — against which Cyril himself had nothing to say, who however was so copious in contradicting him, — wholly and without any controversy you adhere to the laudable part: for from those things which he praises, how will anyone flee? Therefore let us hear those laudable words, which we have already appended above, and which are found in the reprehension of the third chapter or anathematism: THEODORET: "One indeed person and one Son and Christ likewise it is pious to confess, but to say two hypostases or natures united is not absurd, but according to cause consonant."<sup><a href="#fn444" id="fn444-ref">444</a></sup> And he who had said it is pious to confess one Son and Christ one person in two natures and hypostases, immediately converts the natures themselves into two persons, namely into God who is before the ages and man assumed at the end of days, thus writing: THEODORET: "How does he ascribe impiety to those who divide the properties of natures, of God, who is before the ages, and of man assumed at the end of days, he who teaches us mixture through those names?"<sup><a href="#fn445" id="fn445-ref">445</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">But that he acknowledges two natures, God existing before the ages and man assumed at the end of days, is division of one Christ and Son and Lord into two sons, that wise Cyril wrote, — who was accused of commixtion by Theodoret and by you, O Grammarian, was thought to have been silent, — in the defense of the anathematism itself in this manner: CYRIL: "Therefore with similar reason diligently inquiring the union, which is understood to have been made concerning Christ, according to contemplation, indeed we say it was made true, according to union, the conjunction of divinity and humanity, not ignoring that the Word of God is one thing according to nature apart from flesh, and again flesh another thing apart from that, according to its proper nature. But to separate once united, is not safe; nor again to divide one Christ and Son and Lord into two sons, does the reason of rectitude permit to some, holy and divinely inspired Scripture instructing us to this. But it holds a very small account indeed of the truth of dogmas, and of those things which are necessary for utility, as it greatly disdains to know at all those things which are born for harm; but it glories, as it seems, in falsehood, and most skillfully arranging the knowledge of calumny, let him hear from us: 'Why do you glory in malice, O mighty one? Iniquity all the day long, injustice your tongue has devised.'"<sup><a href="#fn446" id="fn446-ref">446</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Does he therefore seem to you to have been silent, who wrote these things against him who had said: THEODORET: "But to say two hypostases or natures united is not absurd, but according to cause consonant," and had converted them into two persons, saying: "How does he ascribe impiety to those who divide the properties of natures, of God who is before the ages and of man assumed at the end of days?" Does it because he manifestly shows that he, who was of such great impiety, through duplicity of natures was dividing one Christ into two sons, seem to you that he said nothing about natures? The same Theodoret, in the reprehension of the anathematism, seems neither to say two sons nor two persons in the very words, but on the contrary manifestly says: "One indeed person and one Son and Christ likewise it is pious to confess." Therefore, shall we grant that he was attacked with false crime by Saint Cyril, who was accusing him of dissection into two sons? And hear about this: CYRIL: "But it holds a very small account indeed of the truth of dogmas." But he was not attacked with false crime unskilled, on account of which in all his reprehension, that is, in the oration opposed, he converts those two natures into God, who assumed, and into man, who was assumed, with blasphemy. And now indeed against Saint Cyril, besides those things already appended, he says: THEODORET: "How therefore does he say hypostases or natures ought not to be divided?"<sup><a href="#fn447" id="fn447-ref">447</a></sup> but now again he says it is pious "much more to acknowledge the properties of natures, of God, who assumed, and of man, who was assumed."<sup><a href="#fn448" id="fn448-ref">448</a></sup> Truly, in the defense against the reprehension of the tenth anathematism, we find Cyril himself, — who, as you say, O Grammarian, concerning the nomination of natures was silent and consenting and had nothing to say, — rising up and saying thus that Theodoret is an image accurately delineated and painted of the noxious Nestorius, he calls "human nature" with decent voice a special person and another Christ: CYRIL: "But that excellent imitator of the execrableness of Nestorius, I say the excellent Theodoret, does not blush saying that the Word assumed human nature and established this beyond common priests, as Paul says: 'For every priest, taken from among men, is ordained for men in those things that pertain to God; sympathizing with those who are ignorant and err, because he also is compassed with infirmity; and by reason thereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.'<sup><a href="#fn449" id="fn449-ref">449</a></sup> Does not Theodoret constitute Emmanuel a common man, according as it seems to him? Similar to this opinion are the opinions of those now named by us and they bring forth equal blasphemy? Do you fear, tell me, the mode of priesthood of our Savior Christ? And do you say it is incongruous for God the Word to function with priesthood humanly on account of dispensation? Therefore put off the mutuated person, deny without fear the inhumanation of the Word."<sup><a href="#fn450" id="fn450-ref">450</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Did Saint Cyril honor Theodoret naming two natures with this silence? This is persuasion without controversy, and consent without contention! This is the poverty of confutations, which has nothing to say! Nevertheless, let us grant, as you say, that these things are so; and that he is silent concerning two natures, when named, he who cried out and reprehended and did not cease to clamor with writings and voice. Let us grant also that Theodoret spoke most excellently about two natures in the reprehensions concerning the chapters saying: "How therefore does he say hypostases or natures ought not to be divided?"; AGAIN: "But to say two hypostases or natures united is not absurd, but according to cause consonant"; AND AGAIN: "How does he ascribe impiety to those who divide the properties of natures, of God existing before the ages and of man assumed at the end of days, he who teaches us mixture through other names?"<sup><a href="#fn451" id="fn451-ref">451</a></sup> Even if with confidence, in him [who spoke excellently], in him who [was not] by Saint Cyril, in him who [......] that in [the reprehensions of the chapters he said] manifestly Christ is in two natures and hypostases, why do you refer impiety, saying: THE GRAMMARIAN: "In two natures, or substances, we say Christ is";<sup><a href="#fn452" id="fn452-ref">452</a></sup> AGAIN: "In two substances we say Christ is; but in two marked hypostases we avoid saying Him"?<sup><a href="#fn453" id="fn453-ref">453</a></sup> How do you judge contests worthy of flight of this man whose victory is celebrated and crowned, and simulating you use syllogisms against those things you write thus: "If therefore the proper flesh of God the Word was not of another, and before assumption was not, how shall I say in two proper hypostases, and call another hypostasis that flesh, which separately neither subsisted nor had any existence, but always subsisted in God the Word?"<sup><a href="#fn454" id="fn454-ref">454</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore does it escape you to say these things against him who is well compacted that Christ is in two natures? Against him who conquered, you move disputes, yourself fleeing from the battle; against him who routed the battle about two natures, nay is crowned; against wise Cyril, and indeed with indisputable opinion; namely the silence of Cyril himself. For see, I ask, how the excellent Theodoret piously constitutes the flesh, before union with the Word, as fashioned infant, [thinking] thence that two natures and hypostases [subsist], and two persons, of God and of man, singly and properly. For in the reprehension of the first chapter of the anathematism, reprehending, as is his custom, mutability; and taking this cause that he thinks it impious to think God the Word was incarnate from Mary, he wrote thus: THEODORET: "It is clear therefore from the things said that the form of God was not changed into the form of a servant; but remaining what He was, He assumed the form of a servant. If therefore God the Word was not made flesh, but assumed living and rationally endowed flesh, He Himself is not according to nature conceived and born and formed and figured from the Virgin, and taking the beginning of existence from thence; who is before the ages, and is God, and is with God, and is with God, and is worshipped with the Father and is known; but, when He fashioned for Himself in the womb of the Virgin, He was with the fashioned and conceived and figured and born. Wherefore we also call the holy Virgin God-bearer not as if she bore God according to nature, but man united to God, who fashioned him."<sup><a href="#fn455" id="fn455-ref">455</a></sup> AND AFTER MANY THINGS: "We call the Virgin not only mother of man, but also mother of God, imposing that appellation indeed on the fashioning and formation, but this on the union."<sup><a href="#fn456" id="fn456-ref">456</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Behold the stupendous seeds of two natures: namely the temple fashioned and formed and born in the virginal womb, but God the Word alien from conception according to flesh and from fashioning and from formation and from nativity. For: "mother of man, he says, and mother of God we call the Virgin, imposing that appellation indeed on fashioning and formation, but this on union." For fashioning and formation belong to the temple, but union follows, which is inhabitation: therefore also they divide the appellations for themselves, and to fashioning and formation indeed the appellation "mother of man," but to union the appellation "mother of God" pertains: THEODORET: "For mother of God, he says, we call the holy Virgin: not as if she bore God according to nature, but man united to God, who fashioned him."<sup><a href="#fn457" id="fn457-ref">457</a></sup> Therefore this infernal and impious one dared with blasphemy to clamor against the voice of John the evangelist and theologian and say: "If therefore God the Word was not made flesh?"; although he could have said: "If the Word was not changed into flesh," — although pretending a cause, he mendaciously accused Saint Cyril, — this indeed he did not add, but for the argument of his blasphemy he said that, which shows he does not wish to confess the truth of the gospel, namely "the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us," nor learned with Paul to say: "For I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believes,"<sup><a href="#fn458" id="fn458-ref">458</a></sup> and from himself he preaches another Jesus, whom the apostles do not preach, a man fashioned and figured and thus united to God, who fashioned him.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">These things Nestorius himself also wrote, in the oration to which is inscribed: "On the saying: 'The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man king, who made a marriage for his son, and sent his servants to call them that were invited to the marriage,' and on the divine inhumanation,"<sup><a href="#fn459" id="fn459-ref">459</a></sup> whose beginning is: "And terrible and joyful is the trumpet of the evangelical reading,"<sup><a href="#fn460" id="fn460-ref">460</a></sup> so saying: NESTORIUS: "Just as [...] clear voice, which the Angel said... I bring forth. 'Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee!' With your birth God, O Virgin; not indeed your birth's germ. With your birth: not indeed He is fashioned. Therefore, how shall I change the voice of the angel and bring: 'Lord' not 'with thee,' but 'from thee'?"<sup><a href="#fn461" id="fn461-ref">461</a></sup> Opposed to these foolish and absurd and Judaic words are the sentiments and doctrines of the apostolic doctors retried, which are under the sun, of the holy Church. For Peter indeed, bishop of Alexandria and divine martyr of Christ, in the book on divinity, — which we also commemorated in the things considered a little before,<sup><a href="#fn462" id="fn462-ref">462</a></sup> — wrote these things: PETER: "Whence also the evangelist asserts the truth saying: 'The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us,' certainly from which the angel saluted the Virgin and said: 'Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.' For this voice 'the Lord is with thee' now it is permitted to hear pronounced by Gabriel in the manner of the voice 'God the Word is with thee'; for it signifies Him and to be conceived in the womb and to become flesh, as it is written: 'The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee; therefore also that which shall be born of thee shall be holy, shall be called also the Son of God.'"<sup><a href="#fn463" id="fn463-ref">463</a></sup> AGAIN, AFTER OTHER THINGS: "But God the Word, with man absent, through the power of God, who can do all things, was made flesh in the womb of the Virgin, who did not need man's operation or presence. For more than the operation of man, the power of God operated, which overshadowed the Virgin with the Holy Spirit, who came."<sup><a href="#fn464" id="fn464-ref">464</a></sup> Gregory the Theologian indeed, in the epistle to Cledonius, wrote words similar to these: GREGORY: "If anyone says the man was fashioned and God afterwards dwelt in him, let him be anathema. For this is not generation of God, but flight of generation."<sup><a href="#fn465" id="fn465-ref">465</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore since the impious Theodoret, O Grammarian, first constitutes and fashions flesh, and thus says "man united to God, who fashioned him,"<sup><a href="#fn466" id="fn466-ref">466</a></sup> and: "How therefore does he say hypostases or natures ought not to be divided?"<sup><a href="#fn467" id="fn467-ref">467</a></sup> and: "But to say two hypostases or natures united is not absurd, but according to cause consonant,"<sup><a href="#fn468" id="fn468-ref">468</a></sup> and: "How does he ascribe impiety to those who divide the properties of natures, of God existing before the ages and of man assumed at the end of days?"<sup><a href="#fn469" id="fn469-ref">469</a></sup> and: "The Word assumed human nature and established this beyond common priests,"<sup><a href="#fn470" id="fn470-ref">470</a></sup> — and you have decided and said: Theodoret, in the reprehensions of the chapters, spoke irreprehensibly about two natures, so that even Saint Cyril, according to your lamentable fables, was silent and consented, and had nothing to say: you are manifestly discovered to have followed Theodoret, who laudably spoke about two natures. For how would you impugn him, to whom wise Cyril was silent and had nothing to say? So, just as he, "two natures and hypostases united" you confess according to fallacious union and which separates by duplicity, and is brought to nothing by perverse calculus, with which you say THE GRAMMARIAN: "In two natures, that is, substances, we say Christ is,"<sup><a href="#fn471" id="fn471-ref">471</a></sup> again: "In two substances we say Christ is, but in two marked hypostases we avoid saying Him,"<sup><a href="#fn472" id="fn472-ref">472</a></sup> and again: "If therefore the proper flesh of God the Word was not of another, and before conception was not, how shall I say in two proper hypostases, and call another hypostasis that flesh, which separately neither subsisted nor again had any existence, but always subsisted in God the Word?"<sup><a href="#fn473" id="fn473-ref">473</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">For although with these definitions you pretend causes, never will you seem orthodox. Nor is it necessary that we ask you whether you are ours, or from the adversaries: for you are from the adversaries, even if imitating the communications of Euripides, otherwise by the change of your words, wishing yourself to be thought. For you indeed, pretending causes, as I said, ask: THE GRAMMARIAN: "How shall I say in two proper hypostases?"<sup><a href="#fn474" id="fn474-ref">474</a></sup>; but Theodoret responds to you: THEODORET: "To say two hypostases or natures united is not absurd, but according to cause consonant,"<sup><a href="#fn475" id="fn475-ref">475</a></sup> and against wise Cyril he says harshly: "How therefore does he say hypostases or natures ought not to be divided?"<sup><a href="#fn476" id="fn476-ref">476</a></sup> and you who, as you yourself testified, benign "where Theodoret was naming two natures was silent and consenting and had nothing to say?"</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That wise Cyril refutes Theodoret converting the name of form into persons.</em></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Nevertheless, if it pleases you, most erudite and most full, we will treat of Cyril's silence, which seemed benign to you. For when he had used the name "form" concerning the divine inhumanation for the name "nature," writing to the most pious queens, thus he said: CYRIL: "Therefore in an unaccustomed manner the Word appears, no longer naked and devoid of flesh, as He was in the beginning, but in form and nature similar to us."<sup><a href="#fn477" id="fn477-ref">477</a></sup> Let us see whether Theodoret, through the name "form," again names "natures" as persons, in those things which he wrote in the reprehensions of the chapters of the anathematisms. Therefore, in the reprehension of the fourth chapter, he says these things with blasphemy: THEODORET: "But if truth does not lie, nor does the day escape God the Word, which He Himself made, which He Himself determined, in which He will judge the world, but He has the knowledge of the Father, as the image of the incommutable; therefore ignorance is not of God the Word, but of the form of the servant, which knew that day from Him who inhabiting revealed."<sup><a href="#fn478" id="fn478-ref">478</a></sup> AGAIN: "Therefore those things indeed which are said and done as befits God, we will accommodate to God; but those which are said and done humbly, we will ascribe to the form of the servant, lest we labor with the blasphemy of Arius and Eunomius."<sup><a href="#fn479" id="fn479-ref">479</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">But let us show how Cyril honored these things with silence, consent, lack of opposing word in the defense of the reprehension: CYRIL: "Therefore all things are of one Christ, befitting God and human. For if indeed the Word, who is from God the Father, was not made man, let Him not speak humanly according to us. But if it is true that He communicated with us in blood and flesh, and was made like in all things to His brethren, that is to us, why do they most foolishly find fault with the dispensation of wisdom, not bearing the human voice, and strive to refer that which is held humble in the words on account of dispensation, as to another separately existing Son, to the form of the servant, as they themselves say? But it is utterly foolish, indeed to feign what the madness of heretics hands down, then to lead away the tradition of right faith itself outside fitting reason. But I would say better and far more erudite, to refer human voices not to another person more, which is understood properly and separately Son, to the form of the servant, as they are accustomed to say, but rather to attribute them to the measures of His humanity. For it behooved Him, since He is God and man at once, to proceed through each discourse."<sup><a href="#fn480" id="fn480-ref">480</a></sup> "Who therefore asserts revelation to have been given to the form of the servant by the inhabiting God, and that measured, exhibits to us Emmanuel as a God-bearing man, and nothing else. Moreover think if something both unequal and ineffable to say. For if it is God the Word, he says, who said: 'Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me,' first indeed He is discordant from the Father, not rightly He refuses to drink the cup, although also, he says, I do not ignore His passion was to be the salvation of the world. Therefore these words, he says, are not of the Word, therefore he will hear also from us who are born to such abominable thoughts: Therefore because it seems to you such voices are to be removed from God the Word, but to be adapted to the form of the servant alone, do you not again divide one into two sons, and to whom from those rightly thinking is this not manifest?"<sup><a href="#fn481" id="fn481-ref">481</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">But certainly, with these appended, I wish to turn and direct speech to Saint Cyril and to say to him, — may our own God make his soul rich and sacred, the Doctor —: What are you doing, O most wise doctor of the Church of the whole world? Why do you break natures and forms? Why do you lay open duality of sons and christs? Why do you sharply insinuate him who laudably preaches two natures and forms, and say that "he exhibits to us Emmanuel as a God-bearing man and nothing else"? Restrain accusation, if it pleases you; do not deflect from the sentence and crowns and wonderful honors of the Grammarian. With ingenuous ones you are silent: I very much fear lest even with cavillers and detractors ……… and overturners of those things which they had built, you be compared.</p>

        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That through those things with which this impious one maliciously praised Theodoret on account of the opinion of two natures or two forms, he does not bring forward a defense of the Tome of Leo, who similarly divides one Christ into forms and natures through the flesh, which is subjected, with blasphemy.</em></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Truly, it is not without reason alien that that which you indeed crowned with crowns of deficiency, that is silence, which professes defeat, O Grammarian, but Theodoret with crowns of excellent and unshaken opinion about two natures and forms, when you present and establish this opinion and praise in the impious Tome of Leo, which the Chalcedonian synodus said concordant with the confession of the apostle Peter and called the column of orthodoxy. And it is easy to see that these words of Leo, which thus hold, do not differ from the sayings of Theodoret now appended: LEO: "For each form does with the communion of the other what is proper to itself, the Word indeed operating what is of the Word, but the body executing what is of the body; and one indeed shines with miracles, but the other succumbs to injuries."<sup><a href="#fn482" id="fn482-ref">482</a></sup> AGAIN: "It is not of the same nature to say: 'I and the Father are one,' and to say: 'My Father is greater than I.'"<sup><a href="#fn483" id="fn483-ref">483</a></sup></p>

        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, if actions and speeches are divided to natures and forms; and to the divine forms and natures of the Word it is to say and operate those things which are of the Word, and to say: "I and the Father are one;"<sup><a href="#fn484" id="fn484-ref">484</a></sup> but again to the human nature and form, or of the body, it is to execute human things, and to succumb to injuries and passions, and to speak humanly, and to say: "My Father is greater than I;"<sup><a href="#fn485" id="fn485-ref">485</a></sup> but it is not of the same, of God indeed according to nature existing and acting and speaking as befits God, but of immutably made man, and at the same time existing God, and speaking and suffering in a human manner according to that which is capable of passion, that is, according to the flesh: against these things we have also whispered those words of Saint Cyril, which, being whispered, are directed at Theodoret, as he sharpens the arrows of his impiety: we have made the ears of the deaf and even the mouths of the dumb to hear;<sup><a href="#fn486" id="fn486-ref">486</a></sup> CYRIL: "For all things are of one Christ, befitting God and human. For if indeed the Word, who is from God the Father, was not made man, let Him not speak humanly according to us. But if it is true that He communicated with us in blood and flesh, and was made like in all things to His brethren, that is to us, why do they most foolishly find fault with the dispensation of wisdom, not bearing the human voice, and strive to refer that which is held humble in the words on account of dispensation, as to another separately existing Son, to the form of the servant, as they themselves say? But it is utterly foolish, indeed to feign what the madness of heretics hands down, then to lead away the tradition of right faith itself outside fitting reason. But I would say better and far more erudite, to refer human voices not to another person more, which is understood properly and separately Son, to the form of the servant, as they are accustomed to say, but rather to attribute them to the measures of His humanity. For it behooved Him, since He is God and man at once, to proceed through each discourse."<sup><a href="#fn487" id="fn487-ref">487</a></sup> AND AGAIN: "Therefore he will hear also from us, who are born to such adulterous thoughts: Therefore because it seems to you such voices are to be removed from God the Word, but to be adapted to the form of the servant alone, do you not again divide one into two sons? And to whom from those rightly thinking is this not perspicuous?"<sup><a href="#fn488" id="fn488-ref">488</a></sup> And again, in the defense of the tenth chapter or anathematism: "For He who does not disdain to become this very thing according to us, how would He reject those things through which He could be seen to have been truly made according to us for us? When therefore we remove Him from human things, both from deeds and from words, by no means will we be distinguished from those who, if indeed it could be done, so to speak, even strip Him of His flesh and do not consider the Scripture inspired by God to be true, but completely overturn the mystery of the inhumanation, the salvation of the world, hope, faith, resurrection."<sup><a href="#fn489" id="fn489-ref">489</a></sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="paragraph subheading">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><em>That the name of communion and familiarity is handed down by those who confess the hypostatic and natural union in a different, varied, and completely diverse manner, but not by those who fabricate a union of habit and will, and posit two forms or two natures operating and divide them properly, and again appropriate passions and miracles.</em></p>
        <p class="paragraph">But truly, to this also, which the Tome of Leo said: "Each of the forms acts with the communion of the other,"<sup><a href="#fn490" id="fn490-ref">490</a></sup> it is pleasing to oppose the refutation from the voice of wise Cyril, which detects and depicts such fictions and artifices;<sup><a href="#fn491" id="fn491-ref">491</a></sup> it was written, however, against the refutations of Andrew, in defense of the third anathematism: CYRIL: "What is common is not common to one, but to two or more things considered properly and separately."<sup><a href="#fn492" id="fn492-ref">492</a></sup> But this communion has been affected by disposition and of mind and will, and relation and habit of familiarity, Leo himself confessed through addition, by dividing that which seemed common to the forms into proper operations, and said: LEO: "The Word indeed operating what is of the Word, but the body executing what is of the body; and one indeed shines with miracles, but the other succumbs to injuries."<sup><a href="#fn493" id="fn493-ref">493</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, where there are not indeed two forms and natures, but one Christ from both according to the conjunction of natural union, one person and one hypostasis and one incarnate nature of the Godhead is acknowledged, just as also a man like us from two, from soul and from body, is acknowledged. Then also these things are done through natural and true communion, but not through a conjunction of disposition, since He is one, that is God the Word incarnate, who operates things worthy of God and human, the flesh not being alienated from the operation worthy of God, because the Word, not lacking flesh, was performing divine signs, nor again was the Word outside bodily and human operations and passions: for He was incarnate; and He who is according to nature incorporeal, through the dispensation was made corporeal, since He was hypostatically united to flesh having a rational soul. Therefore even with His own flesh and capable of passion He was said to suffer, when He also appropriated to Himself the passions of this flesh, to which He was naturally united, then and so, being God, existing impassible because beyond that which was capable of passion, that is the rationally animated body, it could not happen that passions and death should approach and reach: for again they were repelled by the impassibility of the divinity of the Word. These things, however, will confirm and signify in the midst proceeding the sacred voice of the same Cyril. For he wrote in the discourse, in the scholion entitled: "What kind of union we say it is,"<sup><a href="#fn494" id="fn494-ref">494</a></sup> thus: CYRIL: "Therefore the union of the Word to humanity may not inappropriately be compared to our things. For just as the body is indeed diverse in nature from the soul, but one man is absolved and said to be from both; so from the perfect hypostasis of God the Word, and from the humanity having itself perfectly according to its own nature, one Christ, the same existing in the same God simultaneously and man. He appropriates indeed to Himself, as before, the things which are of His own flesh; since it is His body, not another's; He communicates, however, so to speak, to His own flesh the efficacy of virtue worthy of God, which He has, so that this flesh can vivify the dead and heal the sick."<sup><a href="#fn495" id="fn495-ref">495</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">And after a few things: "Furthermore, as in an image, it is permitted to see, in the coal the Word of God united indeed to humanity, not because it ceased to be what it is, but rather because it transformed that which was assumed and united into its own glory and efficacy. For just as fire attached to wood and penetrating it, comprehends it indeed, without removing it from being wood, but rather transmutes it into the property and power of fire and operates all things proper to itself in it, and already is estimated as one something with it: so also understand concerning Christ. For when God is ineffably united to humanity, we say: that it indeed preserved what it was, but He Himself also remained what He was; but united to Himself, as one with it is estimated, making its things His own, and imparting also Himself into it the efficacy of His own nature!"<sup><a href="#fn496" id="fn496-ref">496</a></sup></p>
        <p class="paragraph">Behold, this is the communion of efficacy arising from natural and true union, when the one indivisible efficacy of the hypostasis from two is... For also coal from wood both burns and shines, nor can anyone properly and separately divide these things. So also the flesh of the Word of God, an intellectual coal, both vivifies the dead and heals those who are in infirmities, and it is impossible to divide this operation worthy of God and therefore, because that the Word was operating properly and... Again walking on the earth and taking five loaves and breaking them in His hands, He was performing the work not of another certain one but of His own body. And similarly signified He who said ... that He was emitting the voice with the body, indeed rationally animated, not, however, as those who separate say, to the form of the servant: for the Word incarnate also operated that. And the same is He who accomplishes divine things divinely and human things humanly. And the effects indeed are diverse, inasmuch as some are worthy of God, but some are dispensatory and human, but the efficacy is one, because He who operates is one, God incarnate without change and perfectly inhumanated. Nor on account of the diversity of those things which are done or accomplished, do we establish division and separation and foolishly imagine two natures which operate, saying the Word indeed operates what is of the Word, but the body perfects what is of the body, so that now communion is had through likeness of nature and through conjunction and familiarity of disposition from will.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But truly, let us also see in this error the impious Nestorius, who manifestly wrote to Alexander, who at that time was bishop of the city of Mabbug.<sup><a href="#fn497" id="fn497-ref">497</a></sup> NESTORIUS: "But I think there are two modes of familiarity:<sup><a href="#fn498" id="fn498-ref">498</a></sup> one indeed, of natural affection in passions, such as flourishes between soul and body; the other, however, which according to an affectionate mind happens impassibly toward something on account of a certain love, such as kings have toward their own images. If therefore we say the Word suffered through familiarity, such as flourishes between soul and body, the passion of the Word and of the flesh becomes simultaneous through conjunction. For indeed the soul also and the body suffer through both and with both: for neither does the soul without the body grieve for the sorrows of the body, nor does the body without the soul grieve, because natural compassion of both is through both. So therefore also the flesh itself through familiarity wastes away with the anguish of the soul, and the soul grieves with the sorrows of the body. But if we refer the insult of the flesh on the cross, as if through the image of the king,<sup><a href="#fn499" id="fn499-ref">499</a></sup> to God the Word, it remains that we say the insult of the flesh is from the voluntary disposition of the divinity: which is true and destructive of all heretical loquacity which mixes things that cannot be mixed. For they wish, through natural familiarity, as I said, to affix the passions of the temple to God; but not to have effected those passions as His own through voluntary disposition toward His own temple, through the relation of all natural properties of the flesh to God the Word, so that henceforth the natural properties of the flesh and of divinity cannot be separated..."<sup><a href="#fn500" id="fn500-ref">500</a></sup>... mystical guides...<sup><a href="#fn501" id="fn501-ref">501</a></sup>...familiarity... which according to natural union, but not voluntary, as Nestorius said, the teachers held: and they taught, and the impassible Word of God, and thus He Himself.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Behold therefore how Athanasius, who in the apostolic seat was weighing out the divine doctrine of sound faith, wrote in the oration on faith, which was written rather against the pest of the unspeakable Apollinarius; when he began to accuse those men, he wrote these things: ATHANASIUS: "And elsewhere the Lord was saying: 'Handle me and see, that a spirit does not have bones and flesh, as you see me having,' through that (teaching the nature of spirit to be ineffable, but the contact pertaining to the body to be similar to our body, which He had procured for Himself from the Virgin), not by some mode of operation, but by natural generation, so that according to nature it was body, and again according to nature it was indivisible from the divinity of the Word. For thus also death happened, the body indeed according to nature receiving it, but the Word through will admitting it and with power delivering His own body into death, so that He both suffered naturally for us, and by divinity rose again for us, And the whole business of generation and death awaited our inquiry and reduction. Since these things are thus and are in confession in the Catholic Church of God, how do you say the body is from heaven?"<sup><a href="#fn502" id="fn502-ref">502</a></sup> Gregory the Theologian, however, in the second oration on the Son, wrote these things: GREGORY: "But as the form of a servant, for the sake of servants He lowers Himself and is formed that alien thing, having me whole with my things in Himself, so that, which is worse, He might consume it in Himself as fire does wax and as the sun vapor from the earth, and I ..."</p>

<p class="paragraph">There is subjoined, from codex D, a fragment of the second oration not found elsewhere:</p>

<p class="paragraph">AND AGAIN, OF THE SAME:<sup><a href="#fn503" id="fn503-ref">503</a></sup> "When Leo three times in his Tome commemorated 'union,' nowhere did he put 'the conjunction of natural union' of divinity and humanity, or 'hypostatic union,' or 'from two things one thing,' or 'from two natures one nature or one incarnate hypostasis,' or 'the Son or God or Word incarnate,' or 'one Christ, who is understood from two natures,' such words of Saint Cyril, nor himself, nor the Chalcedonian synod put them, but instead of these they said 'unity of person,' and 'Christ, who is understood in two natures after the union,' and 'hypostasis congruent with person,' such as the explanation of Theodoret saying that the Chalcedonian synod understood hypostasis to be person,<sup><a href="#fn504" id="fn504-ref">504</a></sup> and such as the exposition of Leo 'that the unity of person is in it,'<sup><a href="#fn505" id="fn505-ref">505</a></sup> as is understood by him. Now, if you put 'hypostasis' truly, what is this hypostasis, to which you did not add that it is 'incarnate,' nor anything of those things which are congruous to a composite hypostasis? What is the one hypostasis of flesh and divinity? Whether simple or composite? Whether visible or invisible? Whether of the same or of another nature? Is it composite, and composed from natures dissimilar to each other? But in those things which proceed into one hypostasis of its own, in the same also one incarnate nature is held. If two natures are there after the union, there also two hypostases are after the union. But if it is 'incarnate,' therefore there are also two sons and christs and lords, and the rest."</p>
