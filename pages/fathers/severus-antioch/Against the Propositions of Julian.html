    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">FIRST HERETICAL PROPOSITION</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Concerning this: <em>"We must say that Our Lord shared with us flesh and blood and a rational and intellectual soul, with the exception of sin and corruption, and that he became consubstantial with us, 'to destroy through death the one who held the power of death, that is, the devil, and to deliver—not his own person—but us who through fear of death were subject to slavery'<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> and confess that we have been reconciled with God by the death of his Son<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>,—for he did not spare his beloved Son<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> from suffering for us in the flesh voluntarily, and not by necessity of nature,—and that it is not through the resurrection that he acquired incorruptibility or any other property that belongs to God, as if they did not belong to him already before the resurrection, according to the divine Scriptures and the holy Fathers"</em><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>APOLOGY OF THE ORTHODOX.</strong> That your battle is directed against the inspired Scripture as well as against those who interpret it and against the holy Fathers, this is clear from what you have written. Manifestly: for you slander the truth to introduce your abominable opinion. For all the teachers who profess orthodoxy have transmitted that, with the exception of sin and the corruption which is recognized to result from it, as the holy scripture says, he was in every way like us his brothers,—for which reason he was called by them the first-born from the dead,—the Word of God who became incarnate, of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, Mother of God, in flesh endowed with an intelligent soul, and (was) consubstantial with us, without change or appearance, so that thus he who, because he is God before the ages, is consubstantial with the Father and the Spirit, became truly consubstantial with men. Explain therefore what other corruption you could cite, besides sin,—aside from which, you say, he is consubstantial with us? But it is evident that these are the blameless sufferings, hunger, fatigue, thirst, fear, sadness and similar feelings, the blows and death on the cross, which the Word who took flesh from us and is subject to all these things voluntarily underwent. You will therefore find yourself declaring the flesh impassible and immortal even in the midst of sufferings, something no one among the Fathers has thought! For those who have said him consubstantial with us, have declared that with the exception of sin he imitated our sufferings for us for whom he became man. For it is especially in the sufferings that one recognizes his will, and they proclaim him gloriously to be the author of nature. For if he had not been the author of all creation and of his own flesh, taken from us, which he united to himself hypostatically, he would not have voluntarily permitted the first movement and the violence of the sufferings to be set in motion by the laws of nature, but they would have arisen in him without his will and by necessity, as they do in us, and, after their invasion, he would have controlled himself in the same manner as any one of our kind and an ordinary man who, thanks to his voluntary character, remains firm in the midst of what happens to him independently of his will. Do not, therefore, slanderously incriminate, by rejecting the truth of the body which is passible by nature and subject to natural and blameless sufferings, their involuntary character! For it is not that the God Word was incapable of rendering, from the conception in the womb, his flesh impassible and immortal, just as it was also holy, bearing remedy for all diseases, giving life to the dead and, by virtue of its union to him, acting as befits God. But in order to win a legitimate victory over death, and not a forced one, he voluntarily allowed it to remain passible and mortal, so that it might receive in a human manner the assault of death and sufferings, that the victory over Satan who holds the empire of death might acquire, along with (that of) power, the (character of) wisdom and justice and that through him we might become victors.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">That things are so, this is what the words cited above from those who shone with the mysterious teachings of the divine doctrines make us understand: they have transmitted to us, according to the inspired Scripture, to confess that Christ voluntarily suffered in the flesh and that, put to death according to the flesh, he was restored to life according to the spirit<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>; so that, as through a man death came, so also through a man (will come) the resurrection of the dead. For he accomplished everything for us who had fallen into death and needed to rise again, to return to the blessed life free from tribulation and to the first order from which we had fallen.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Saint Cyril, from what he addresses to Diodore, that the body of our God and Savior Christ is holy and without sin, that in this he is incorruptible from the moment of the incarnation and always and that there is in this neither community nor similarity with us, because he was in every way like us with the exception of sin<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> and that it is in the same things that he shared blood and flesh<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> with us, as the Apostle declared: [CYRIL] "My dear, I say that you utter foolish words and strongly marked by stupidity. For the holy body indeed came from Mary, but from the beginning of its composition and constitution in the womb, it was holy, as the body of Christ, and one cannot see a moment when it was not his, but 'ordinary', as you say, and comparable to the elements of another flesh"<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>. From the same, from the twelfth book of the Commentary on the Gospel of John, that the most holy body of Emmanuel acquired, after the trials of sufferings and by the resurrection that befits a God, the incorruptibility consisting in impassibility and immortality, just as it also became the first-fruits of our resurrection and the first-born from the dead: [CYRIL] "It is therefore in all conformity with the economy that our Lord Jesus-Christ, while he had not yet transformed his temple into the glory that is due and fitting to him, still appeared in his first forms, because he did not want to bring confirmation of the resurrection to another body than the one he had taken from the Holy Virgin, in which he had died after the crucifixion, as it is written, the power of death rushing upon the flesh alone from which it was also expelled. For if it is not his body which knew death that is resurrected, what death was conquered? And where would the power of corruption have been rendered powerless, since none among the rational creatures died, neither soul, nor angel, not to speak of the Word of God? When therefore the power of death made itself felt only on what is naturally apt to be corrupted, one rightly understands that it is also on this that the power of the resurrection is truly exercised, so that the strength of the tyrant may also be destroyed. As for the fact that our Lord enters through the closed door, it will be ranked, among the wise, with his other miracles"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>. From Saint John, taken from the Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, that the body of our God and Savior Christ is without sin and not impassible and immortal in the voluntary and blameless sufferings, but that after the victory won over death it was constituted immortal by the resurrection: [CHRYSOSTOM] "For Christ did not have a sinful flesh, but one which, while being similar to our sinful flesh, was without sin and, by nature, the same as ours, so that by this very fact one understands that the nature of the flesh is not evil. For it is not by taking another flesh in place of the first, nor by changing this one according to its nature, that Christ prepared it, in this state, to resume the combat, but by letting it maintain itself in its nature, he made it win a crown over sin, and then, after the victory, he resurrected it and rendered it immortal"<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Saint Cyril, taken from the twelfth book of the Commentary on the Gospel of John, that the necessary and natural character of the sufferings does not remove the fact that Emmanuel suffers voluntarily: for it is he himself who allowed these, which were his, to exercise themselves according to the natural laws: [CYRIL] "When therefore all the malice coming from the iniquity of the Jews against Christ was consumed and nothing more was lacking henceforth for their cruelty which exceeded reason to appear complete, at the end of all this the flesh still experienced something that is proper and natural to it. It let itself be penetrated by thirst, dried up as it was by the many wounds from the blows. For violent pains generally provoke an overwhelming thirst, absorbing, under the effect of an inexpressible physical heat, the humor which is found in the depths (of the body) and consuming, by inflammatory pains, the interior of the patient. There was no difficulty, indeed, for the God Word who can do all things, to remove this also from his flesh. But as he had tolerated by his will to experience all the rest, he also experienced this by his own will. And it is thus that he asked to drink"<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Saint Proclus, bishop of Constantinople, taken from the Letter to the Armenians, that one must not only confess that the body of our Lord and our God Savior Christ, who suffered voluntarily for us, is consubstantial with us, but that he suffered as we do, with the exception of sin, and that it is not of his own debt that he acquitted himself, but of ours, because he who knew no sin was not guilty: [PROCLUS] "The God Word therefore became perfect man, without this prodigy which surpasses understanding having diminished the unchangeable nature. But this very thing we have learned by faith, and we have not attained it by investigation. And, having become man, he redeemed in what imitated our sufferings the race which was associated with him according to the flesh by the fact that he abolished the debt of sin by dying for us as man, and that he destroyed the one who held the power of death, that is, Satan, as God hating evil"<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From the venerable John, bishop of Jerusalem, in whose days the sacred body of Stephen the first martyr was discovered, what was cited in his treatise on the impious synod held at Chalcedon, by the memorable athlete Timothy, bishop of Alexandria, that he imitates our sufferings in the body and the intelligent soul, Christ who suffered without (committing) sin and voluntarily and that it is the resurrection that incorruptibility, meaning immortality, took as a beginning: [JOHN OF JERUSALEM] "We confess that, when the God Word, the eternal and Only-begotten Son of God, for the redemption of the human race, was born of the Holy Virgin Mary and by the Holy Spirit,—of a woman, as the Apostle said<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>,—and that he took from her a flesh truly, and not in appearance, consubstantial with our flesh, he truly endured sufferings for us: he experienced the fatigue of the journey traveled, as we also do and not in appearance, and as we also he slept and, as we, he felt the pains of the blows, when he was scourged before Pilate; and when his cheeks were struck, he bore the pains, and when his hands and feet were pierced by the nails, he felt the pains, as Isaiah said concerning him: 'He himself took our sins and it is for us that he was struck. And we, we thought he was in pain, mistreated and infirm; but it is he who was struck because of our sins and who was weakened because of our iniquities'<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> and again: 'The man who was struck and knowing how to bear illnesses'<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>. And we also share the sentiment of the divine Paul, when he says this concerning him: 'For we do not have a high priest incapable of sympathizing with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin'<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>. And we confess that he had a rational soul which endured sufferings for us, as our souls do, and which truly underwent the sufferings of our souls, that is, sadness, trouble and anguish. For this is what the evangelists teach concerning him when they attest that he said: 'My soul is sorrowful, even to death'<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> and: 'Behold, now my soul is troubled'<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>. It is also written concerning him in the Gospel of Mark: 'He began to be seized with sadness and anguish'<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>. And as we confess that the passions of the flesh occurred in truth and not in appearance, so we believe that those of the soul occurred in truth and not in appearance. As for those who say that, while he was scourged, he felt no pain or that, while he was crucified, he did not suffer, while the nails penetrated him, we anathematize them as heretics. But we confess that he truly died for our sins, that his body was placed in the tomb, where it remained without a soul, and that, after three days, he truly rose from the dead; that after his resurrection he ate and drank with his disciples, truly and not in appearance, that he ascended into heaven and that, at the end of the world, he will come to judge the living and the dead and he will raise from the dead the whole human race in incorruptibility, the bodies in which men died and were buried possessing the same nature, as he also possessed the same body, when he rose from the dead"<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From the venerable Gregory of Nyssa, from the Catechetical Discourse, that it is in the will to win the victory, not by violence but according to law and justice, over the one who held the empire of death that Christ voluntarily died our death. Therefore it is after the trial of sufferings and after the resurrection that the immortality of the body occurred for him whom, after being resurrected, we also will follow, for whom he died and rose again: [GREGORY] "What then is just in this domain? Not to resort to some violent power against the one who held us and not to leave the occasion of a founded reproach to the one who had enslaved man by concupiscence, by snatching them, by the abundance of his power, from the one who held them"<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>. And further: [GREGORY] "For his return from death became for the mortal race the beginning of a return to immortal life"<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">SECOND HERETICAL PROPOSITION</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Concerning this: <em>"Let us not say corruptible, in any manner and at any time whatsoever, the body of our Lord, but let us confess it, from the moment of the inexplicable and authentic union, in all things incorruptible, holy and life-giving because of the union with him, following the divine Scriptures and the holy Fathers"</em><sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>APOLOGY OF THE ORTHODOX.</strong> Again the question manifestly clashes with the orthodox sentences and the words of the holy Fathers who teach that, before the resurrection, the body of the one who voluntarily suffered for us was passible and mortal,—and it is in this sense that they declared and recognized it corruptible,—but that after the resurrection it was incorruptible,—which implies impassibility and immortality,—the incorruptibility relative to sin being found in him at all times.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Saint Cyril, from the second book of the Treasure: [CYRIL] "For, since he took a corruptible body, mortal and subject to similar sufferings, he necessarily appropriated also, with the flesh, the sufferings of the latter; and as the flesh underwent them, he himself is said to have undergone them. It is thus, indeed, that we say that he was crucified and that he died, while it is the flesh itself which underwent all that and not the Word taken isolated and apart from it"<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>. And taken again from the same book: [CYRIL] "First-born also from the dead<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>, for it is he who first raised his flesh to incorruptibility, he who first made it ascend to heaven. And that is why he also said: 'I am the way'<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup> and: 'I am the door'<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>; for it is through him that human nature was instructed to engage on the new road of the resurrection and to enter, as through a door, into heaven itself"<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>. And again: [CYRIL] "Just as he was called the first-born among many brothers<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>, because those who have been saved by him have been called by grace to divine adoption, and again the first-born and the first-fruits from the dead<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>, by the fact that he himself, before all, rose for incorruptibility; so he is also said to have been created 'beginning of the ways'<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup> because henceforth through him each one can tend to salvation"<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Saint Gregory the Wonderworker, from the treatise On the Incarnation and on Faith, in the explanation of the second anathematism, which clearly shows that after the resurrection, exists the incorruptibility of the body which (consists) in impassibility and immortality, and not at the time of the sufferings: [GREGORY] "But the Word gave in himself the proof of the sufferings which are ours, by taking upon himself the possibility as it is written: 'He himself took our weaknesses and took our afflictions'<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup>. For trouble, weakness and affliction are weaknesses of the soul, but fatigue, sleep and bodily mutilation are infirmities of the flesh"<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>. And again in the Commentary on the first anathematism: [GREGORY] "And corruption was destroyed in the burial<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> of the body and the first-fruits of the resurrection were shown"<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup>. With this also he opportunely places the fourth anathematism and its commentary, manifestly condemning the one who does not confess Christ incorruptible in the flesh after the resurrection: [GREGORY] "He who declares that Christ is subject to change or alteration and does not confess him unchangeable in spirit and incorruptible in the flesh, as it is written<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>, let him be anathema!"<sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>. Commentary of the anathematism; [GREGORY] "And how could one say Christ subject to change and alteration, when Our Lord himself declared: 'I am and I have not changed'<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup>, and again: 'His soul was not abandoned to Hades and his flesh did not see corruption'<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup>. Who therefore is so rash and impious as to break the solid constraint of this commentary which maintains us in the time that followed the resurrection and instructs us by holy words which teach that it is in that time that we must confess that the flesh of our God, the Unchangeable, was unalterable, impassible and immortal and that it did not undergo corruption and dissolution in the sepulcher. For, after the resurrection, appearing to his disciples, he declared what the divine Luke wrote concerning him: It is I, whose soul was not held in Hades and whose flesh did not see corruption in the tomb. Indeed, to extend this to the time preceding the resurrection belongs to impiety and rashness and overflows with an excess of ridicule! From the same, in the Exposition of the Faith by parts, where he clearly subscribes to what is said: [GREGORY] "The divinity suppressed the possibility of the flesh by the consummation of the mysteries. After the destruction of death in the holy body, (there was) a perpetual impassibility and an unchangeable immortality"<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Saint Cyril, taken from the book of the Treasures, who teaches that not to distinguish the times, but to confuse the moments, is foreign to those who are instructed in the divine Scripture, but is familiar to those who are contaminated by heresies, just as to ignore the significance of the person in question: [CYRIL] "And first of all it is necessary that he who ventures into the research of the divine Scripture, take into account the time during which is declared what is made known, as well as the person by whom, or through the intermediary of whom, or about whom, the declaration is made. For it is in this way that the spirit of those whose intentions are upright will be kept from error"<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup>. And immediately, a little further: [CYRIL] "For it is because they ignored the time that the sectarians of Hymenaeus and Alexander erred, in opining that the resurrection had already taken place for him and in making this very declaration"<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Saint Athanasius, taken from the third book On the Trinity directed against the impious Arians: [ATHANASIUS] "In what has not taken body, what pertains to the body would not have occurred, unless he had taken a corruptible and mortal body. For holy Mary was mortal, from whose body his was issued. Also as he had come to be in a body that suffered, wept and toiled, one must attribute to him with the body what belongs to the flesh"<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup>. Behold, he calls the body also: corruptible, mortal and suffering, so that the truth of the blameless and salutary sufferings for us may be safeguarded.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">THIRD HERETICAL QUESTION</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Concerning this: <em>"Let us not say that before the transgression of the precept death and corruption existed according to nature,—for it is not God who is the author of death, as it is written<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup>; it is outside of nature, because of sin, that it made its entrance into us after the transgression of the precept, according to the divine Scriptures and the holy Fathers"</em><sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>APOLOGY OF THE ORTHODOX.</strong> One must pronounce against each of these questions, seeing that you manifestly oppose yourself to the divine Scripture and to those who have interpreted it. For they teach clearly that it is by grace, and not by nature, that man possessed immortality before the transgression of the precept; that if Adam had preserved this grace, the composite, the living being, would not have undergone the natural separation and dissolution which is death which, after sin, made its entrance and found place.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Saint Athanasius, from the Catechetical Treatise, concerning the bodily appearance of our Lord and Savior Jesus-Christ: [ATHANASIUS] "For man is mortal according to his nature, because he has become from things that are not; but thanks to his resemblance to him who is, supposing that he had preserved it by the contemplation of God, he would have awaited the natural corruption and would have remained incorruptible; as Wisdom says: 'The observance of the law is the guarantee of incorruptibility'<sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup>. Now as long as he was incorruptible, he already lived as if he had been deified, as the divine Scripture again shows somewhere which declares: 'I said: You are gods, you are all sons of the Most High; but you will die like men and you will fall like one of the princes'<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup>. And this was accomplished by the consent (given) to the serpent: [ATHANASIUS] "As Wisdom says: 'God created man for incorruptibility' and made him an image of his eternity; 'it is by the envy of the devil that death entered the world'<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup>. And when this was done, men were reached by death; moreover, corruption henceforth triumphed over them, strengthening all the more, more than (required by the natural order), its hold on the whole human race, which had previously received the threat of God which weighed upon the (men) in case of transgression of the precept"<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Cyril, from a decisive solution to a request of a certain deacon Tiberius and his colleagues, which makes clearly understood and as by the enunciation of a rule that we have lost nothing of what we possess by nature, by the transgression of the precept by Adam, so that it may be recognized that the incorruptibility and immortality of which we had been despoiled existed by grace and not by nature: [CYRIL] "For we have lost nothing of what we possess by nature"<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">FOURTH HERETICAL PROPOSITION</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Concerning this: <em>"Let us not say the body of Our Lord passible and mortal by virtue of a necessity and, in this very sense, corruptible and subject to natural necessities, but let us confess that it is voluntarily and according to truth that he bore the redemptive sufferings for us and the death that brings life, without departing in this from the impassibility and immortality which are his, but in transmitting to us by this the impassibility and immortality, according to the divine Scriptures and the holy Fathers"</em><sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>APOLOGY OF THE ORTHODOX.</strong> This proposition is laden with the same blasphemy as the preceding ones, when it establishes in an insane and totally imbecilic manner that if we confess that the body of our God and Savior, Jesus-Christ, is passible and mortal by nature and subject to blameless sufferings, the Word himself permitting it, we introduce in the one who suffered by his own will the involuntary character. And this is what this suave man seems to postulate, when he believes to rebuke John, the bishop of Constantinople of holy memory, the irreproachable Doctor! Let us therefore cite, drawing from his own words, the refutation of this calumny which weighs upon the Doctor, against the father of these vigorous propositions, who applies himself to flee the truth of the body and the redemptive sufferings.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Saint John, from the sixty-seventh discourse of the Commentary on the Gospel of John, when he explains the word of Christ: "Now, behold, my soul is troubled"<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup>, elucidating it by this: [CHRYSOSTOM] "As if someone said: 'Even if we are troubled, even if we are in terror, let us not flee from death, since I too, who am troubled for the moment, do not speak of fleeing', for it is fitting to bear what presents itself. I do not say: 'Deliver me from the present hour', but what? 'Father, glorify your name'. And even if it were that which the trouble pushed to say, it is the contrary that I say: 'Glorify your name', that is to say: 'Henceforth, lead me to the cross'. He puts the accent very well on the humanity and the nature which does not desire to die, but pretends to live the life here below, indicating that it was not outside human passions. For just as neither being hungry nor sleeping are reprehensible, so being pleased with the life here below is not either. Now Christ had a body exempt from sins, and not detached from natural necessities, otherwise there would not have been a body"<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup>. From the same, from the eighty-fifth discourse of the same commentary, which shows that the natural character of the sufferings of the body does not entail (their) involuntary character, but that the incarnate Word, who became man by his will and not by constraint, authorized, when he himself willed it, the shaking of the movement of death and the blameless sufferings, which not only would not have reached nor penetrated him, but would not even have been triggered from the principle, if the intervention of the will had not preceded it: [CHRYSOSTOME] "After this Jesus knew that all was accomplished<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup>, meaning that nothing was lacking to the economy. For everywhere he strove to demonstrate that this death was strange, if it is true that all was in the power of the one who died and that death reached his body only at the moment when he himself willed it. Now he willed that it be after having accomplished everything. That is why he also said: 'I have the power over my soul to lay it down and I have the power also to take it up again'<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup>. Knowing therefore that all was accomplished, he said: 'I thirst'<sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup>. And here again he accomplished anew a prophecy"<sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup>. From the same, from the fourth discourse of the Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews: [CHRYSOSTOM] "And it is in truth that he said that he tasted death for all<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup>, and he did not say that he would die; for just as he truly tasted it, so after having remained in it a little while, he immediately rose from it. And in saying therefore: 'because of the suffering and of the death' he signified the true death; and in saying: 'superior to the angels', he made understood the resurrection. For just as the doctor who does not feel the necessity to taste the foods prepared for the sick, because of his solicitude for the sick, tastes them himself first to persuade the patient to take heart with confidence to take food, so, as all men dreaded death, to persuade them to despise death, he himself tasted death, although he had no necessity for it. For he said: 'The prince of this world comes and he has no right over me'<sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup>. Does he therefore who teaches this, show, by the fact that he confessed the truth of the natural sufferings, that it is by necessity that Christ suffered? And he does not at all believe, in line with the one who enunciates these propositions, that the incarnate God, who underwent all that, was led to it by necessity and constraint, he who in the flesh underwent natural sufferings to his own flesh which are salutary for us, but that, in speaking thus, he declares the body of our Savior incorruptible after the resurrection, that is, impassible and immortal. Moreover, one can see him giving again the same teaching in the eightieth discourse of the same Commentary<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup>, in the following manner: [CHRYSOSTOM] "You, my Father, glorify me with you with the glory that I had with you before the world was<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup>. And where does this glory reside? If it happens that you were among men, normally deprived of glory because of the garment which covered you, how did you also seek to be glorified with God? What does he say here? It is of the economy that he speaks, since the nature of the flesh had not yet been glorified, that it did not yet enjoy incorruptibility and that it did not share the throne of royalty. That is why he did not say 'on the earth', but 'with you'. It is of this same glory that we also will enjoy in our measure, if we have watched. That is why Paul also said<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup>: 'If we suffer with him, we will also be glorified with him'<sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup>."</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The same thing is declared, in agreement with him, by Theophilus, who illustrated the see of the great and very Christian city of Alexandria, in the Commentary on the text of the gospel where these words are found: "And Jesus went throughout all Galilee, teaching in the synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and infirmity among the people<sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup>: [THEOPHILUS] "The kingship of our Savior was therefore exercised, and David, in joy, sings: 'The Lord is king, he has clothed himself with majesty'<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup>. It is because he took a corruptible body that he clothed himself with majesty, by resurrecting it not corruptible, but incorruptible. 'The Lord is king, he has clothed himself with majesty'<sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup>: he took back his body by resurrecting it, according to the announcement he had made of it: 'Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up'<sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup>. It is therefore this body which he resurrected that he had clothed. For he had said: 'You have not abandoned my soul to Hades and you have not allowed your Holy One to see corruption'<sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup> and again: 'My flesh will dwell in hope'<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup>. After his death, he did not remain in the sepulcher, but as long as he remained there, he did not see corruption. Corruption did not dominate him, because the Word, the incorruptible, resurrected the corruptible body for incorruptibility"<sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup>. Behold, the doctor has clearly shown to all the disciples of Piety that not to see corruption was not to be held by corruption and to sow in advance in us the seed of incorruptibility by the resurrection by becoming the first-born from the dead.</p>

        <p class="subheading">FIFTH HERETICAL PROPOSITION</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Concerning this: <em>"Let us not say that the judicial sentence was a decree aimed only at the body, which states: 'You are dust and to dust you shall return'<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup>, but let us confess that it is to the address of the whole man, of soul and body, that this was said, according to the divine Scriptures and the holy Fathers"</em><sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>APOLOGY OF THE ORTHODOX.</strong> I am very much astonished at the manner in which, at the end of all the propositions, with the sole aim of illusion, you mention the Scriptures and the Fathers, you who openly and impudently dissolve their teaching, not only in its spirit, but in its very expression, and (then) you pride yourself on their doctrine! From Saint Cyril, from the first book of the Commentary on the Gospel of John, which clearly puts before the eyes of all that it is by a grace that man had acquired incorruptibility before the transgression of the precept and that it is to the sole address of the flesh that the declaration was made: "You are dust and to dust you shall return"<sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup>: [CYRIL] "Man is therefore a rational animal, but composite, meaning of a soul and of this earthly and temporal flesh. Because he had been made by God and had come into being, without holding from his own nature incorruptibility or indestructibility,—for these belong by nature to God himself,—he had been marked with the spirit of life, acquiring, by an intimate relation with God, a grace that surpasses nature; for 'he breathed into his face a breath of life and man became a living soul'<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup>. And receiving the punishment of his defection, then, and justly, he heard: 'You are dust and to dust you shall return'<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup>. He was despoiled of the grace and the breath of life left the earthly flesh, meaning the spirit of him who said: 'I am the life'<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup>. And the living being fell into death, according to the flesh only, while the soul maintained itself in immortality, for it is to the flesh alone that it had been said: 'You are dust and to dust you shall return'<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup>."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">SIXTH HERETICAL PROPOSITION</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Concerning this: <em>"Let us not say that the sufferings of Our Lord provoked corruption and that his death caused corruption, but let us say the sufferings salutary, and the death life-giving, according to the divine Scriptures and the holy Fathers"</em><sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>APOLOGY OF THE ORTHODOX.</strong> Again this proposition also brandishes a weapon of combat against God and against the words of the Fathers and the Scriptures inspired by the Spirit. For the sufferings which naturally cause corruption,—those which are exempt from sin,—as well as the death which the Word of God who became incarnate in a flesh naturally apt and subject to suffer voluntarily endured, he also changed them themselves into incorruptibility: he experienced them by suffering truly and not by not suffering. For this is what suffering in appearance implies, as those who speak of phantasm and erroneously believe that the body was immortal and impassible in the very death and sufferings, to the point that one confesses that he, the mortal, neither received nor underwent what is ours in the flesh, but that one conceives him to have died and suffered in appearance. From Saint Cyril, from the twelfth book of the Commentary on the Gospel of John: [CYRIL] "For it is a sign of bodily corruption that the perforations of the hands and the side and the aspect of the stigmas and of the blows struck by the iron have subsisted and still exist"<sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup>. And further: [CYRIL] "As henceforth corruption absolutely no longer subsisted after the resurrection, especially (that) of a holy flesh, since it was renewed for him in incorruptibility, one also believes that he no longer felt the need of customary food as before. And he showed the places of the nails and did not refuse to take food to confirm the great mystery of the resurrection and to implant its faith in our souls in all"<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup>. From the same, from the Letter to Acacius, Bishop of Scythopolis, concerning the question of Azazel: [CYRIL] "For in rising from the dead he had stripped off corruption, and, with it, of all that it entails"<sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup>. Let each of the faithful consider the sense of the orthodox doctrine: it is according to their own nature that the doctors give the name of corruption both to the sufferings and to the death and to the signs which result from them, the wounds and the scars, and they have proclaimed that they were, from the resurrection, transformed into incorruptibility, so that it spread from them to us also, for the intention of whom our Savior had suffered.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">SEVENTH HERETICAL PROPOSITION</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Concerning this: <em>"Let us not say that the body of Our Lord underwent corruption, completely or partially, but let us confess that, from the very union, it was such as it was after the resurrection,—for as he died for us, so he rose for us,—without acquiring any increase by the resurrection, but from the moment when it was united to the God Word, it was also incorruptible, and holy and life-giving, according to the word of the holy Fathers"</em><sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>APOLOGY OF THE ORTHODOX.</strong> This proposition sails in the same erroneous thoughts, like those shipwrecked who cannot float in water and frequently expectorate the same gulp of salt water. Now their solution has been previously established, clearly and sufficiently, in the apologies brought above. For absolutely no one among those who have taught competently in the churches since the time of the apostles has declared that the body of our Lord, God and Savior Christ is impassible and immortal from the moment of the union, but rather passible and mortal, and by that very fact corruptible, so that it was in what is naturally apt to suffer that the sufferings and true death were undergone, but that it is impassible and incorruptible, that is, immortal, after the resurrection that befits a God.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Saint Ignatius the God-bearer, martyr and archbishop of Antioch, from the Letter to the Ephesians, which teaches that Christ is first passible in the flesh and then impassible: [IGNATIUS] "There was one physician, carnal and spiritual, created and uncreated, God among men, true life in death, (issuing) from Mary and from God, first passible and then impassible, Jesus-Christ our Lord"<sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Saint Athanasius, from the third book On the Holy Trinity against the odious Arians: [ATHANASIUS] "From then on one should have been astonished that the Word had been in such a passible flesh, that he had not prevented those who sought to strike him down and had not taken vengeance on his murderers, although he could have, he who had prevented others from dying and had raised the dead from among the dead but that he had consented that his body should suffer. For that is also why he came, as I have said previously, so that he might suffer in the flesh and that henceforth the flesh might be constituted impassible and immortal and, as we have frequently repeated, so that in him befalling him, the opprobrium and all that had happened to him would no longer reach men, but that they would be completely annihilated by him, and that these might henceforth remain forever incorruptible, as temples of the Spirit"<sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Saint Gregory of Nyssa, from the third book of what he wrote Against Eunomius: [GREGORY] "The divinity indeed humbled itself so that the human nature might contain it, but humanity was renewed when, by combining with the divinity, it became divine! For just as the wind is not retained in the water, when it enters it with some heavy object and remains at the bottom of the water, but it rushes towards a world that is familiar to it and the water many times rises together with the breath of the wind upwards, covered on its outer surface as with a light membrane, while it stands in the air surrounding it, so also he who is the true life, who is in the flesh, returning towards himself after the passion, the flesh which is his also rose with him, rising thanks to the divine immortality from corruption to incorruptibility"<sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Saint John, from the Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, when he explains the word of our Lord to his disciples: "I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I will drink it with you in a new way"<sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup>: [CHRYSOSTOM] "You indeed who are my witnesses, you will see me resurrected. And what does this word 'new' mean? In a new manner, that is to say which is not customary, from the fact that I do not have a passible body, but henceforth immortal and incorruptible and not feeling the need for food. It is therefore not by need that he ate and drank after the resurrection,—the body no longer felt the need for it henceforth,—but to confirm by this the fact of the resurrection"<sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">From Saint Epiphanius, bishop of Salamis, taken from the treatise of the Ancoratus: [EPIPHANIUS] "He entered through closed doors to show that what is dense was subtle, that what is mortal was immortal and what is corruptible incorruptible; and to confound all those who do not believe in our redemption, I mean in the resurrection, he who had transformed the body into subtle matter and had penetrated the resurrection with spirit, did not erase the scars of the nails nor the place of the lance, but he showed that it is what suffered on the cross that was resurrected, and not another, and that it was not another issued from him, but that it is this very thing which had suffered that rises again impassible and that it is the grain which had fallen that was resurrected<sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup>, but that it was resurrected incorruptible"<sup><a href="#fn92" id="ref92">92</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">EIGHTH HERETICAL PROPOSITION</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Concerning this: <em>"Let us not say that the body of Our Lord was conquered and subjected by a natural necessity to the constraint of sufferings and death in the manner of our bodies, or that it was in any aspect whatsoever subject to debts, but let us confess the sufferings and the death in the manner of the holy Fathers"</em><sup><a href="#fn93" id="ref93">93</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><strong>APOLOGY OF THE ORTHODOX.</strong> The present question also advances, in the manner of beetles, turning in the same excrement, and several times it returns the filth, rising by its very expression against the law of the divine Scripture and the holy Fathers. For no one has been so unreasonable as to say that the flesh of Our Lord was subject to the culpability resulting from sin, but all have thought that it was subject to natural and blameless sufferings, and that it is to this that the flesh of Our Lord who became incarnate was subjected, as we have said many times, in that he permitted it to endure what is proper to it.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And behold, the very wise Cyril arises, who shines with the glorious brightness of the morning star and dissipates, like some dark cloud, the blasphemy of the question in the fifth book Against the Blasphemies of Nestorius: [CYRIL] "Thus therefore, although he is said to have suffered, we recognize him impassible as God, but we say that he underwent in his flesh, according to the economy, death, so that, by trampling it and by rising again, by the fact that he is according to his nature life and life-giving, he might transform for incorruptibility what death dominated, that is, the body, and that thus the efficacy of this work carried out well might reach us, extending to our entire race"<sup><a href="#fn94" id="ref94">94</a></sup>. And again: [CYRIL] "Thus therefore he permitted that his body behave according to the laws of its nature and he assumed to taste death. And it is opportunely that the Word who was united to him permitted that he undergo it: he was resurrected by the divine power of the Word who was hypostatically united to him. It is therefore the whole Emmanuel,—which is interpreted: our God with us,—that we understand, when we hear the divine Peter declare: 'This Jesus, God has raised him'<sup><a href="#fn95" id="ref95">95</a></sup>"<sup><a href="#fn96" id="ref96">96</a></sup>. Behold therefore accused, the one who utters these impious propositions, by the very wise Cyril who wrote and declared this: The body of Christ, our God and Savior, which voluntarily received in what is naturally apt to die, according to its nature, the assault of death and which destroyed the tyranny which weighed upon the whole human race by the resurrection, was dominated by death. And he, slandering the Father and Doctor and attributing to him the renown, by upsetting (his language), to declare that it is because of his own sin, that Christ was worthy of death! The Redeemer, the Liberator and God by nature died, certainly, and he knew no sin<sup><a href="#fn97" id="ref97">97</a></sup> he who offered himself for us to God the Father as a victim and a spotless host, thereby making our sins ascend upon the wood and healing us all by his wounds. But behold, again advances the mystagogue who holds Christ speaking in him and with a powerful force destroys the calumny by what he wrote as follows in the third tome Against the Blasphemies of Nestorius: [CYRIL] "He therefore needs a victim for his own sins, whoever renders himself guilty of sin. Now Christ offered himself for his race according to the flesh, that is, for us, but in no way for himself, because he is above sin as God"<sup><a href="#fn98" id="ref98">98</a></sup>. How therefore does he who submitted these questions to us, declare that he has posed them according to the divine Scriptures and the holy Fathers? As if Absalom, the murderer of his father, said that he observes the law which prescribes: Honor your father and your mother, while he had resorted to the violence of arms against David, his humble father, the prophet and the legitimate king! Or as if the people of the Samaritans, the Mede, the Assyrian, the insane one who dwells in Shechem, as a Sage said<sup><a href="#fn99" id="ref99">99</a></sup>, boasted of being a true Israelite and of observing the Law given by God through the intermediary of Moses!</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I have been constrained to redact in the form of a summary these ideas which refer him who approaches them to the reading of the two letters which contain in a very complete manner the words of the theophoric doctors and which teach what one must think and say concerning the incorruptibility of the most holy body of our Lord to all, our God and Savior Christ<sup><a href="#fn100" id="ref100">100</a></sup>. For among them, as from a meadow laden with all sorts of flowers, these words also have been plucked, as they say, with the fingertips, as far as possible, in Christ, who shares glory and power with the Father and the Holy Spirit in the centuries. So be it!</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The heretical questions and the chapters which oppose them, coming from the testimonies of those who teach the mysteries of the orthodox faith, are ended.</p>
