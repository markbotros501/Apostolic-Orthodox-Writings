    <h1>Book Six: On the Spirit of Fornication</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 1</p>
        <p class="paragraph">According to the tradition of the Fathers, the struggle against the spirit of fornication is for us a long and enduring one compared to others, and very few achieve complete victory over it. For the human race cannot be freed from this unless the other vices are first overcome. This battle begins from the first time of puberty and cannot be conquered unless the other vices are first subdued.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">A twofold assault arises against us with a double weapon, and therefore we must resist this most impure spirit with a double defense. For just as the illness of the flesh requires the acquisition of strength for both body and soul, so too, unless spiritual knowledge is joined to it, even the labor of fasting and continence and the work of hands—restraining and recalling the wandering movements of the heart—and above all true humility (without which no vice can ever be triumphed over) will be unstable and in vain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 2</p>
        <p class="subheading">The principle remedy against the spirit of fornication</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The principal remedy against the spirit of fornication comes from the perfection of the heart, from which also the power of this disease is signified to proceed by the voice of the Lord. He says: "From the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness"<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, etc. That, therefore, must first be cleansed from which the fountain of life and death is known to flow, as Solomon says: "Guard your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life"<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. For the flesh serves its judgment and command, and therefore it must be subjected with utmost diligence to the salutary precepts of the soul, lest, filled with abundant food, it throw down its ruler, the spirit, becoming insolent.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But if we place the whole sum of our effort only in chastising the body, while the soul does not similarly fast from other vices nor is occupied with divine meditation and spiritual studies, we will by no means be able to ascend to that most sublime summit of true integrity, with that principle in us infesting the purity of the body.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, we must first cleanse, according to the saying of the Lord, what is inside the cup and dish, so that the outside also may become clean<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 3</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">How much solitude contributes to overcoming the vice of fornication.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Other vices are also usually purged by human interaction and daily exercise, and in a certain way cured by the demonstration of their own falls; such as anger, sadness, impatience, which are healed by meditation of the heart and vigilant solicitude, and by the frequent and assiduous provocation of brothers. And while they are more often manifested and more frequently reproved, they come more quickly to health.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">But this disease requires the affliction of the body and contrition of heart; it also needs solitude and withdrawal, so that it can arrive at the full state of health through the pernicious fever of the limbs. Just as often certain illnesses of the body are cured by abstinence from food and drink, and by the application of suitable medicines; but this disease is inflamed more by these very remedies. Therefore, just as the careful discipline of fasting must be sought, lest an abundance of food fill the flesh; so also very much contributes to driving away this particular disease: rest and solitude, so that the sick mind, not assailed by different images, arriving at a purer contemplation, may more easily root out the pestilent tinder of concupiscence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 4</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">What is the difference between chastity and continence, and whether both can be held at the same time.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Let no one think from this that we deny that continent persons can be found even placed in a congregation of brothers, which we confess can very easily happen. For it is one thing to be continent, that is, to restrain oneself from the desires of the flesh; another to be chaste, which is, so to speak, to pass into the state of integrity or incorruption, which virtue is attributed especially to those who remain virgins either in mind or in body, as both Johns in the New Testament; in the Old also Elijah, Jeremiah, Daniel are known to have been.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In whose rank also those will not undeservedly be reckoned who, after the experience of corruption, through long labor and industry have come to a similar state of purity with integrity of mind and body, and feel the stings of the flesh not so much by the assault of foul concupiscence as only by the movement of nature. Which state we say can with great difficulty be apprehended among crowds of men; but whether it is even impossible, let each one not expect to recognize from our opinion, but measure by the examination of his own conscience.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Moreover, we do not doubt that there are many continent persons who extinguish and restrain the assault of the flesh, which they sustain either rarely or daily, either from fear of hell or from desire of the kingdom of heaven. Whom the elders, as they proclaim cannot be completely overwhelmed by the onslaughts of vices, so also they define cannot always exist secure and uninjured. For it is necessary that each one placed in the struggle, although he often conquers and overcomes the adversary, nevertheless is sometimes troubled by him.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 5</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">That the assault of fornication cannot be conquered by human effort alone.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, if it is dear to us to strive lawfully in the spiritual contest with the Apostle<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, let us hasten to overcome this most impure spirit with all intention of mind, not trusting in our own strength (for human industry cannot accomplish this), but in the help of the Lord. For the soul must be assailed by this vice for so long until it acknowledges that it wages a battle beyond its strength; and that it cannot obtain victory by its own labor or effort, unless it is supported by the help and protection of the Lord.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 6</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">On the peculiar grace of God necessary for obtaining chastity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And indeed, while in all advances of virtues and in the overthrow of all vices, the grace and victory belong to the Lord, in this especially a particular benefit and special gift of God is declared by the opinion and experience of the Fathers themselves to those who have merited to possess it. For in some manner it is to go out of the flesh while still dwelling in the body; and it is beyond nature, encompassed by fragile flesh, not to feel the stings of the flesh. And therefore it is impossible for human powers (so to speak) to soar to so precious and heavenly a reward, unless the grace of the Lord has raised it from earthly filth with the gift of chastity. By no other virtue are carnal men so properly made equal to spiritual angels by imitation of life, as by the merit and grace of chastity, through which, still dwelling on earth, they have, according to the Apostle<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>, citizenship in heaven; which, having laid aside carnal corruption, they are promised to have as saints in the future, possessing it here already in fragile flesh.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 7</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">An example from worldly contest, according to the saying of the Apostle.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Hear what the Apostle says: "Every athlete exercises self-control in all things"<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>. Let us inquire from all which things he said, so that instruction for the spiritual contest may be acquired for us by comparison with the carnal one. For those who strive to compete lawfully in this visible contest do not have the faculty of using all foods which the desire of appetite suggests, but only those which the discipline of the same contests has established. And not only are they necessarily to abstain from forbidden foods and drunkenness and every excess, but also from all inertia, idleness and sloth, so that by daily exercises and constant meditation their strength may increase; and they become alien to all solicitude and sadness and particular business, even in affection and conjugal work, so that apart from the exercise of discipline they know nothing else, nor are they entangled in any worldly care at all: hoping only from him who presides over the contest to acquire the substance of daily sustenance, and the glory of the crown, and worthy rewards and praise of victory. And they keep themselves so clean from every pollution of coitus that when they prepare themselves for the contests of the games, lest perhaps through nocturnal sleep some deceit might diminish the strength acquired over a long time, they cover the genital members with lead plates, so that by the rigor of the metal applied, they may be able to absorb obscene humors: understanding that without doubt they will be conquered, and will no longer be able to fulfill the proposed contest from their own strength, if a deceitful image of pleasure has corrupted the provided purity of chastity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">How great therefore is the gift of integrity, without which even those who were under the Old Testament could not participate in typical sacrifices; and those who desire to obtain the corruptible crown of this world cannot be crowned!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 8</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">On the comparison of the purification of those who are about to have a contest in the earthly contest.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, if we have understood the discipline of the worldly contest, by whose example the blessed Apostle wanted to instruct us, teaching how great is the observance, how great the diligence, how great the custody in it: what will be fitting for us to do? With what purity will it be necessary to guard the chastity of our body and soul, whom it is necessary to feed daily on the most holy flesh of the Lamb, which even the precepts of the old law do not permit any unclean person to touch? For in Leviticus it is thus commanded: "Every clean person shall eat the flesh." And, "Whatever soul eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of salvation, which is the Lord's, in which there is uncleanness, that soul shall be cut off from his people"<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, with all vigilance the workshops of our heart must first be cleansed. For what they desire to achieve in purity of body, we ought to possess even in the secrets of conscience: in which the Lord, sitting as arbiter and judge, continually expects the contest and race of our course, that we may not admit those things which we shudder at openly, nor suffer them to coalesce within by incautious thought; and in which we are confounded by human knowledge, we may not be polluted even by hidden connivance. Which, although it may escape human notice, nevertheless cannot hide from the knowledge of the holy angels and of the omnipotent God himself, whom no secrets escape.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 9</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">That we ought always to prepare purity of heart before the eyes of God.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, if we have understood the discipline of the worldly contest, by whose example the blessed Apostle wanted to instruct us, teaching how great is the observance, how great the diligence, how great the custody in it: what will be fitting for us to do? With what purity will it be necessary to guard the chastity of our body and soul, whom it is necessary to feed daily on the most holy flesh of the Lamb, which even the precepts of the old law do not permit any unclean person to touch? For in Leviticus it is thus commanded: "Every clean person shall eat the flesh." And, "Whatever soul eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of salvation, which is the Lord's, in which there is uncleanness, that soul shall be cut off from his people"<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>.</p>

Which, although it may escape human notice, nevertheless cannot hide from the knowledge of the holy angels and of the omnipotent God himself, whom no secrets escape.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 10</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">What is the indication of perfect and integral purity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This will be the evident indication and full proof of this purity: if no deceiving image occurs to us while we are at rest and relaxed in sleep, or certainly if one does interrupt, it is unable to excite any motions of concupiscence. For although such a commotion is by no means reckoned to full guilt of sin, yet it is not yet an indication of perfect mind, nor a manifestation of the vice thoroughly refined; since through deceitful images an illusion of this kind operates.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 11</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">From what vice nocturnal illusion proceeds.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For the quality of thoughts, which is guarded more negligently by the distinctions of the day, is proven by nocturnal quiet, and therefore, when such an illusion has intervened, it should be believed to be not the fault of sleep, but the negligence of preceding time, and the manifestation of a disease hidden within, which the hour of night did not first produce, but brought forth to the surface, hidden in the inmost fibers of the soul, by the refreshment of sleep, arguing the secret fevers of our members, which we have contracted by feeding on harmful thoughts throughout the space of the day: as it is known that even bodily illnesses are not gathered at the time when they are seen to emerge, but are acquired by the negligence of past time, when someone imprudently, by foods contrary to health, has contracted for himself harmful and lethal humors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 12</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">That purity of flesh cannot be obtained without cleanness of heart.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And so the Creator and Founder of the human race, God, knowing the nature of his work and its amendment above all, applied the care of medicine there, whence he knew the causes of the disease principally emanate: "Whoever," he says, "looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart"<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>. He does not so much accuse the wanton eyes to us, as that inner sense which misuses their office for seeing. For the heart is the field and wounded by the dart of lust which sees for lusting: twisting the benefit of sight, rightly granted to itself by the Creator, to the service of wicked works by its own vice, and producing the hidden disease of concupiscence within itself by the occasion of contemplation. Therefore, the salutary precept is given to this, by whose vice the most evil weakness proceeds from the occasion of sight. For it is not said, "With all vigilance guard your eyes," which certainly ought to be guarded principally if the effect of concupiscence proceeded from them; for the eyes present nothing more than the simple office of vision to the soul; but it says, "Guard your heart with all vigilance"<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>: medicine imposed especially on that, which can everywhere abuse the ministry of the eyes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 13</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">That carnal thoughts rising first must be immediately repelled.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This, therefore, will be the first custody of this cleansing: when the memory of the female sex creeps into our mind through the subtle suggestion of diabolical cunning, we should hasten to extrude it as quickly as possible from our senses by the prior recollection of mother, sisters, relatives, or certainly holy women: lest if we linger in it longer, the deceiver of evils may subtly devolve and precipitate the mind to those persons through whom he can insert harmful thoughts. For which reason we ought always to remember that precept: "Guard your heart with all vigilance"; and according to the principal command of God, diligently observe the harmful head of the serpent<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>, that is, the beginnings of evil thoughts, by which the devil tries to creep into our soul; lest if its head has penetrated our heart through negligence, the rest of its body, that is, the assent of delight, may rush in. Which, without doubt, if admitted, will kill the captured mind with a venomous bite.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">We ought also to extinguish emerging sinners of our land, that is, carnal senses, at their morning rising, and while they are still very small, dash the children of Babylon against the rock<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>. Which, unless, while they are very tender, they are killed, by connivance grown up, they will rise up stronger against us in all things, and certainly will not be conquered without great groaning and labor.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For when the strong spirit guards his house armed, fortifying the recesses of his heart with the fear of God, all his substance will be in peace<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>: that is, the profits of labors and virtues acquired over a long time. But if a stronger one coming overcomes him, that is, the devil by consent of thoughts, he will seize his arms in which he trusted, and will divide his spoils, namely the merits of virtues, dispersing them through contrary vices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 14</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">That we do not strive to weave praise of chastity, but to expound its effect.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And that I may briefly run through all that are inserted in the holy Scriptures in praise of this virtue (for it is not my purpose to weave praise of chastity, but to explain from the traditions of the Fathers concerning its quality, or how it ought to be acquired or guarded, or what its end is), I will place only one sentence of the blessed Apostle Paul, by which it may be clear how he preferred it to all virtues, commending it with the nobility of the word.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 15</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">That the virtue of chastity is especially called sanctification by the Apostle.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">"For this is the will of God, your sanctification"<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>. And lest he should leave it doubtful or obscure to us what he wanted to call sanctification, whether justice, or charity, or humility, or patience, he immediately and manifestly designates what he properly wanted to call sanctification. "That you abstain," he says, "from fornication; that each one of you know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor, not in the passion of desire, like the Gentiles who do not know God"<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>. See with what praises he pursues it, calling it the honor of the vessel, that is, of our body, and sanctification. Therefore, on the contrary, he who is in the passion of desire is in ignominy and impurity, and is alienated from sanctification. Thirdly also, after a little, he infers, again pronouncing it sanctification. "For God has not called us to impurity, but in sanctification. Therefore, whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you"<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>. He joined inviolable authority to his precept, saying: "Whoever disregards this," that is, what I have prefaced concerning sanctity, "disregards not man," that is, me who command these things, "but God," who speaks in me, "who also has destined his Holy Spirit as a dwelling for our heart." You see with how simple and pure words he extols it with such great praises, first properly attributing sanctification to this virtue; then asserting through this the vessel of our body is to be freed from impurity; thirdly that, having cast aside ignominy and contempt, it is to remain in honor and sanctification; lastly, which is the highest reward of perfect beatitude, through this he designated the Holy Spirit would be the inhabitant of our breast.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 16</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">On another testimony of the Apostle concerning the same sanctity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And although the discourse tends to the end of the booklet, I will place yet another similar testimony of the same Apostle passed over. For writing to the Hebrews he says: "Strive for peace with all, and for the holiness without which no one will see God"<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>. Here also he evidently pronounced that without holiness, which he is accustomed to call integrity of mind or purity of body, God cannot be seen at all; since here similarly he infers, explaining the same sense: "Lest any fornicator or profane person, like Esau..."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 17</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">That the hope of higher reward ought to increase the custody of chastity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, since the prize of chastity is so sublime and heavenly, it is assailed by all the more grievous snares of adversaries. And for this reason it is all the more necessary for us to apply not only continence of body but also contrition of heart with assiduous groans of prayer, <strong>so that the furnace of our flesh—which the king of Babylon does not cease to kindle with the incitements of carnal suggestions—may be extinguished by the dew of the Holy Spirit descending into our hearts.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 18</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">Chastity with humility, and knowledge with chastity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">For as the elders say that this cannot be apprehended unless the foundations of humility have first been placed in the heart; so also they define that not even the fountain of true knowledge can be reached until the root of this humility has settled in the inmost parts of our soul: and it is indeed possible for integrity to be found without knowledge by grace, but truly impossible for spiritual knowledge to be possessed without the chastity of integrity. Because also there are different gifts, and not one grace of the Holy Spirit is given to all, but to which each one has rendered himself worthy and fit by his study or industry. Finally, while in all the holy apostles the virtue of perfect integrity is believed to have been, yet the gift of knowledge abounded more abundantly in Paul, because he prepared himself fit for this by skillful study and industry.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, as sublime and precious as is the prize of chastity, so much more grievously is it assailed by the snares of adversaries. And therefore it is proper for us, not only continence of body, but also contrition of heart with assiduous groans of prayers is to be applied, so that the furnace of our flesh, which the king of Babylon does not cease to kindle with incentives of carnal suggestions, may be extinguished by the dew of the Holy Spirit descending into our hearts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="subheading">CHAPTER 19</p>
        <p class="chapter-intro">The saying of blessed Basil of Caesarea concerning the quality of virginity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The strict saying of Saint Basil, bishop of Caesarea, is reported: "I do not know a woman, and I am not led to be a virgin." In so much he understood the incorruption of the flesh to consist not so much in abstinence from a woman, as in integrity of heart, which truly perpetually guards the incorrupt sanctity of the body, either by fear of God or by love of chastity.</p>

        <p class="chapter-intro">Whence perfect integrity of mind is recognized.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This, therefore, is the end and perfect proof of integrity: if no titillation of pleasure steals upon us while we are at rest, and obscene concretions are expelled by us unconsciously from the necessity of nature. Which, as it is beyond nature to cut off completely and forever, so to recall them to the inevitable and rarest necessity of nature is of great virtue, which is accustomed to trouble a monk with an interval of two months. Which, however, was said according to our experience, not according to the opinion of the elders, by whom even this space of time was judged to be very narrow, lest if we wish to explain it in the manner we have received from them, perhaps those who, due to their negligence or more remiss study of purity, have less experience of this, may think we have described unbelievable or impossible things.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Up to this point, therefore, we must hasten, and up to this point we must fight against the motions of the mind or the incentives of the flesh, until that condition of the flesh fulfills the necessity of nature, not arouses pleasure, pouring forth the congealed abundance without any itching and harm, not arousing a fight against chastity. But the mind, while it is still deluded in sleep by the vision of images, should know that it has not yet been thoroughly refined to the full perfection of chastity.</p>

        <p class="chapter-intro">Remedies of cure, by which perfect purity of our heart and body can remain.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">And in what measure fasting is always to be held. For whoever exceeds the measure of strictness, it is necessary that he also exceed the measure of relaxation. Which inequality held, he will without doubt be called back from that most pious state of tranquility: now by excessive evacuation weakened by defect, now by more abundant food distended. For with the changes of refreshment, the quality of our purity also is necessarily changed. Then perpetual humility and patience of heart is to be applied, and vigilant caution against anger or other passions through the day. For where the poison of fury lurks, there also the fire of lust necessarily penetrates. But above all, nocturnal vigilance is necessary. For as purity and custody of the day prepare chastity for the night, so nocturnal vigils equally impart a most solid state to the heart and observance of the day.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Therefore, so that illusions may not even creep upon us while sleeping, a moderate and measured fast must always be maintained. For whoever exceeds the measure of strictness will necessarily also exceed the measure of relaxation. Held by this inequality, he will undoubtedly be called back from this most serene state of tranquility: now weakened by excessive emptiness due to lack, now distended by more abundant food. Indeed, with a change in refreshment, the quality of our purity must also necessarily change. Next, constant humility and patience of heart must be continually applied, along with attentive caution against anger or other passions throughout the day. For where the poison of fury resides, the fire of lust must also necessarily penetrate. But above all, a vigilant and necessary nocturnal watchfulness is essential. For just as purity and daytime vigilance prepare for nocturnal chastity, so nocturnal vigils likewise impart a most solid state and strength to the heart and to daytime observance.</p>
