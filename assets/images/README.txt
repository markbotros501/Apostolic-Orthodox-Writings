FAVICON SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==========================

To set up your website logo/favicon for search engines and browsers, place the following image files in this folder:

REQUIRED FILES:
1. favicon.ico - Main favicon file (16x16 or 32x32 pixels)
2. favicon-16x16.png - 16x16 pixel PNG version
3. favicon-32x32.png - 32x32 pixel PNG version
4. apple-touch-icon.png - 180x180 pixel PNG for iOS devices
5. og-image.png - 1200x630 pixel PNG for social media sharing (Open Graph image)

WHERE TO GET/CREATE THESE:
- You can use online favicon generators like:
  * https://favicon.io/
  * https://realfavicongenerator.net/
  * https://www.favicon-generator.org/

- For the og-image.png (social media preview):
  * Create a 1200x630 pixel image with your logo/website branding
  * This appears when your site is shared on social media or shown in search results

NOTE: After adding the image files, you may need to clear your browser cache to see the favicon update.
